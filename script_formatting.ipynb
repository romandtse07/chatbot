Their\\n     search takes them to a wrecked alien spacecraft whose doors gape open\\n     -- it is dead and abandoned.  Inside they find, among other strange\\n     things, the skeleton of one of the unearthly space travellers.\\n\\n     Certain clues in the wrecked ship lead them across the hostile surface\\n     of the planet to a primitive stone pyramid, the only remnant of a\\n     vanished civilization.  Beneath this pyramid they find an ancient tomb\\n     full of fantastic artifacts.  Lying dormant in the tomb are centuries-\\n     old spores, which are triggered into life by the men\\'s presence.  A\\n     parasite emerges and fastens itself to one of the men\\'s faces -- and\\n     cannot be removed.\\n\\n     An examination by the ship\\'s medical computer reveals that the\\n     creature has inserted a tube down his throat, which is depositing\\n     something inside him.  Then it is discovered that the parasite\\'s blood\\n     is a horribly corrosive acid which eats through metal -- they dare not\\n     kill it on the ship.\\n\\n     Ultimately it is dislodged from its victim and ejected from the ship,\\n     and they blast off from the Hell-planet.  However, before they can seal\\n     themselves into suspended animation for the long voyage home, a\\n     horrible little monster emerges from the victim\\'s body -- it has been\\n     growing in him, deposited there by the parasite... and now it is loose\\n     on the ship.\\n\\n     A series of ghastly adventures follow.  They trap it in an air shaft\\n     and a man has to crawl down the shaft with a flamethrower -- it tears\\n     a man\\'s head off and runs away with his body -- a man is crushed in\\n     the air lock door and the ship loses most of its air in a terrific\\n     windstorm -- another man is burned to death and then eaten by the\\n     creature -- and another is woven into a cocoon as part of the alien\\'s\\n     bizarre life cycle.\\n\\n     Finally there is only one man left alive, alone on the ship with the\\n     creature, and only six hours till his air runs out; which leads to a\\n     climax of horrifying, explosive jeopardy, the outcome of which\\n     determines who will reach Earth alive -- man or alien.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n                         CAST OF CHARACTERS\\n\\n     CHAZ STANDARD,\\n          Captain.................A leader and a politician.

Then, slowly, he\\n     begins to move toward the far side of the room.\\n\\n     They approach a console on the wall, training their lights on it.\\n     There is a machine.

When the entire room is in flames, he turns and\\n     scrambles back up the ladder.\\n\\n     INTERIOR - MAINTENANCE LEVEL\\n\\n     Roby drops to his knees and gasps for breath, trying not to throw up.\\n     At length, he regains control of himself.\\n\\n     EXTERIOR - OUTER SPACE - AT LIGHT SPEED\\n\\n     The SNARK appears to hang motionless, with planets and star clusters\\n     rolling past in the infinite distance.\\n\\n     INTERIOR - BRIDGE\\n\\n     Roby is putting the cat into a metal, vacuum-sealed catbox, with a\\n     little oxygen tank on it.\\n\\n                              ROBY\\n               Kitty go bye-bye.\\n\\n     He seals the catbox, then turns on the oxygen.  There is a faint hiss\\n     of pressurized air.  Wild-eyed, the cat peers out of a little window in\\n     front.  It YOWLS.\\n\\n     He picks up the pressurized catbox and leaves the bridge.\\n\\n     INTERIOR - MINING & CARGO BAY\\n\\n     Carrying the catbox and a shoulder bag (and of course the\\n     flamethrower), Roby goes quickly to the nearest rank of metal\\n     cannisters.\\n\\n                              ROBY\\n                    (reading from labels)\\n               What\\'ll it be, Kitty?

Studying the instructions, he begins to close switches, one\\n     by one.\\n\\n     A SIREN BEGINS TO HONK THROUGHOUT THE SHIP.\\n\\n                              COMPUTER\\n               Attention!

Shaking with nervousness, he\\n     hurriedly picks up catbox, bag and flamethrower and hurries out of the\\n     engine room.\\n\\n     INTERIOR - CORRIDORS IN SHIP\\n\\n     Roby hurries on, listening to the siren.\\n\\n                              COMPUTER\\n               Attention!

The thing can\\n     be heard fumbling around in the passageway.\\n\\n     Finally, he turns and bolts back toward the engine room.\\n\\n     INTERIOR - CORRIDORS IN SHIP\\n\\n     Like a maniac, Roby runs through the ship, level after level, pounding\\n     down stairwells, his footsteps clanging metallically throughout the\\n     ship as he sprints for the engine room.\\n\\n                              COMPUTER\\n               Attention!

The room is full of\\n     smoke and the engines are whining dangerously.  It is extremely hot in\\n     the room; Roby instantly breaks out in sweat.\\n\\n     He runs to controls and begins throwing back on the cooling unit\\n     switches.\\n\\n     Still THE SIREN CONTINUES.\\n\\n                              COMPUTER\\n               Attention!

He turns and runs from the\\n     engine room.\\n\\n     INTERIOR - CORRIDORS IN SHIP\\n\\n     Again, Roby must run through all the levels of the ship, this time\\n     up the stairs, exhausted, stumbling, while the computer counts down:\\n\\n                              COMPUTER\\n               Attention!

He grabs the flamethrower and turns it toward\\n     the passageway.\\n\\n     It is then he realizes that THE LIFEBOAT DOOR IS OPEN AGAIN.\\n\\n     Quickly, he glances around to see if the creature might be behind him.\\n     Then he advances on the passageway.\\n\\n     INTERIOR - PASSAGEWAY\\n\\n     Dripping with sweat, his face a mask of fear, Roby enters the\\n     passageway, flamethrower gripped tightly in his hands.  He is goaded on\\n     by the siren and the computer:\\n\\n                              COMPUTER\\n               Attention!

Engines will explode in\\n               60 seconds!\\n\\n     INTERIOR - LIFEBOAT\\n\\n     He comes in on the run, hurls the catbox and bag toward the front, and\\n     does a dive over the back of the control chair.  He is no sooner in the\\n     seat than he hits the \"LAUNCH\" button.\\n\\n     EXTERIOR - NOSE OF SHIP - OUTER SPACE\\n\\n     The retainer clips drop away, and with a blast of ramjets, THE\\n     LIFEBOAT IS LAUNCHED AWAY FROM THE \"SNARK.\"\\n\\n     INTERIOR - LIFEBOAT\\n\\n     Roby is frantically strapping himself in, as the lifeboat accelerates\\n     away from the mother ship.\\n\\n     EXTERIOR - SPACE\\n\\n     The tiny pod of the lifeboat accelerates away from the larger bulk of\\n     the SNARK.  The scene is strangely serene for such deadly\\n     circumstances.\\n\\n     INTERIOR - LIFEBOAT\\n\\n     Roby finishes strapping himself in, then he reaches and grabs the\\n     catbox.  The cat is YOWLING.  Roby hugs the box to his chest and hunches\\n     his head down over it.\\n\\n     EXTERIOR - SPACE\\n\\n     The SNARK drifts ever farther away as the lifeboat leaves it behind,\\n     until it is barely a point of light.\\n\\n     THEN IT BLOWS UP.\\n\\n     AN EXPANDING ORANGE FIREBALL WITH PIECES OF METAL FLYING IN ALL\\n     DIRECTIONS.\\n\\n     INTERIOR - LIFEBOAT\\n\\n     The shockwave hits the escape craft, jolting it and rattling\\n     everything inside.  Then all is quiet.\\n\\n     Roby unhooks himself from his straps, rises, and goes to the back of\\n     the lifeboat.  He stares out through the porthole.  His face is bathed\\n     in orange light.\\n\\n     EXTERIOR - SPACE\\n\\n     What he sees is the boiling fireball, now fading and fizzling away\\n     into nothingness, and a couple of pieces of debris floating past.\\n\\n     INTERIOR - LIFEBOAT\\n\\n     Roby\\'s expression is mournful as he watches the final obliteration of\\n     his ship and friends.\\n\\n     BEHIND HIM, THE CREATURE EMERGES FROM SOME HIDING PLACE -- IT HAS BEEN\\n     INSIDE THE LIFEBOAT ALL ALONG.\\n\\n     The cat SCREECHES.\\n\\n     Roby whirls, and finds himself facing the thing across the length of\\n     the boat.  It squats, then pulls out its trophy -- a man\\'s arm.\\n\\n     It begins to eat the arm, watching Roby.\\n\\n     His first thought is for the flamethrower -- unfortunately, it lies on\\n     the floor right next to the monster.  Next he glances around for any\\n     place to hide.  His eye falls on a tiny locker containing a space suit,\\n     with the door standing open.\\n\\n     He begins to edge toward the locker.  The creature rises.  He freezes.\\n\\n     It throws down the arm.  With that, Roby dives for the open locker\\n     door, hurls himself inside, and slams the door shut.\\n\\n     INTERIOR - SPACESUIT LOCKER\\n\\n     There is a clear glass panel in the door, and the thing puts its face\\n     right up to the glass, peering in at Roby.  The locker is so small that\\n     Roby\\'s face is only inches away from the creature\\'s.  The sight is\\n     disgusting.  It turns its head, looking at him in curiosity.\\n\\n     Then the MOANING OF THE CAT distracts it.\\n\\n     INTERIOR - LIFEBOAT\\n\\n     The creature waddles over to where the pressurized catbox sits.  It\\n     bends down and peers inside.  The CAT YOWLS LOUDER.\\n\\n     It picks up the catbox in its tentacles.\\n\\n     INTERIOR - SPACESUIT LOCKER\\n\\n     Trying to distract the monster away from the cat, Roby TAPS ON THE\\n     GLASS.\\n\\n     But the monster reacts so fast that its face is instantly back at the\\n     glass, startling the hell out of Roby.\\n\\n     Getting no more interference from him, the thing returns to the\\n     catbox.\\n\\n     Roby looks around.  He spies the spacesuit.  Quickly, he begins to pull\\n     it on.\\n\\n     INTERIOR - LIFEBOAT\\n\\n     The creature picks the catbox up in its tentacles and shakes it to see\\n     if there is anything inside.  The cat MOANS.\\n\\n     INTERIOR - SPACESUIT LOCKER\\n\\n     Roby is halfway into the pressure suit.\\n\\n     INTERIOR - LIFEBOAT\\n\\n     The creature throws the catbox down.  It clangs, and bounces.  The thing\\n     picks it up again and hammers it against the wall.  Then it jams it\\n     into a crevice in the wall.\\n\\n     With one tentacle, it begins to pound the sealed catbox into the\\n     crevice.  The cat has gone beyond hysterics.\\n\\n     INTERIOR - SPACESUIT LOCKER\\n\\n     Roby pulls on the helmet, latches it into place, then turns on the\\n     oxygen.  With a hiss, the suit fills itself.\\n\\n     In a rack on the wall is a long metal rod with a blunt rubber tip.\\n     Roby peels the rubber off, revealing a sharp steel point.\\n\\n     Again he raps on the glass.\\n\\n     INTERIOR - LIFEBOAT\\n\\n     The creature turns.  It faces the locker, peers at him.\\n\\n     INTERIOR - SPACESUIT LOCKER\\n\\n                              ROBY\\n               Try a little of this, you fucking\\n               bastard.\\n\\n     HE KICKS THE DOOR OPEN.\\n\\n     INTERIOR - LIFEBOAT\\n\\n     The creature rises, but just in time to catch THE STEEL SHAFT RIGHT\\n     THROUGH ITS MIDRIFF.\\n\\n     IT MAKES A HORRIBLE NOISE AND CLUTCHES AT THE SPUR.  The yellow acid\\n     begins to flow from the wound.\\n\\n     Before the acid can touch the floor, Roby reaches back and pulls a\\n     switch -- BLOWING THE REAR HATCH.\\n\\n     In a poof, the tiny atmosphere in the lifeboat is sucked out into\\n     space -- and the bleeding creature along with it.  Roby grabs a steel\\n     strut to keep from being sucked out, but as the creature passes him IT\\n     WRAPS THE END OF A TENTACLE AROUND HIS ANKLE.\\n\\n   \\n\\n   \\n\\n     EXTERIOR - LIFEBOAT - OUTER SPACE\\n\\n     Roby is now hanging halfway out of the lifeboat, with the thing\\n     clinging to his leg.  He kicks at it with his free foot, but it won\\'t\\n     let go.\\n\\n     INTERIOR - LIFEBOAT\\n\\n     Looking for any salvation, Roby grabs the hatch control lever and\\n     yanks it.\\n\\n     The hatch slams shut, closing Roby safely inside but TRAPPING THE END\\n     OF THE CREATURE\\'S TENTACLE IN THE DOORJAMB.\\n\\n     It instantly releases Roby, who staggers back.\\n\\n     EXTERIOR - LIFEBOAT - OUTER SPACE\\n\\n     The creature is now outside the lifeboat, in the vacuum, squirming,\\n     the tip of its tentacle caught in the closed hatch.\\n\\n     INTERIOR - LIFEBOAT\\n\\n     Where the tentacle is caught in the hatch, it is wounded, and is\\n     starting to foam with acid, eating away at the metal.\\n\\n     Roby stumbles forward to the controls and pushes a lever labeled:\\n\\n                              \"RAM JETS\"\\n\\n     EXTERIOR - LIFEBOAT - OUTER SPACE\\n\\n     The jet exhausts are located at the rear of the craft, right where the\\n     creature is wriggling.

The last we see of it is a few smouldering rags, dwindling\\n     into infinity.\\n\\n                                                            DISSOLVE TO:\\n\\n     INTERIOR - LIFEBOAT - LATER\\n\\n     The boat is re-pressurized and Roby is seated in the control chair.

Their\\n     search takes them to a wrecked alien spacecraft whose doors gape open\\n     -- it is dead and abandoned.  Inside they find, among other strange\\n     things, the skeleton of one of the unearthly space travellers.\\n\\n     Certain clues in the wrecked ship lead them across the hostile surface\\n     of the planet to a primitive stone pyramid, the only remnant of a\\n     vanished civilization.  Beneath this pyramid they find an ancient tomb\\n     full of fantastic artifacts.  Lying dormant in the tomb are centuries-\\n     old spores, which are triggered into life by the men\\'s presence.  A\\n     parasite emerges and fastens itself to one of the men\\'s faces -- and\\n     cannot be removed.\\n\\n     An examination by the ship\\'s medical computer reveals that the\\n     creature has inserted a tube down his throat, which is depositing\\n     something inside him.  Then it is discovered that the parasite\\'s blood\\n     is a horribly corrosive acid which eats through metal -- they dare not\\n     kill it on the ship.\\n\\n     Ultimately it is dislodged from its victim and ejected from the ship,\\n     and they blast off from the Hell-planet.  However, before they can seal\\n     themselves into suspended animation for the long voyage home, a\\n     horrible little monster emerges from the victim\\'s body -- it has been\\n     growing in him, deposited there by the parasite... and now it is loose\\n     on the ship.\\n\\n     A series of ghastly adventures follow.  They trap it in an air shaft\\n     and a man has to crawl down the shaft with a flamethrower -- it tears\\n     a man\\'s head off and runs away with his body -- a man is crushed in\\n     the air lock door and the ship loses most of its air in a terrific\\n     windstorm -- another man is burned to death and then eaten by the\\n     creature -- and another is woven into a cocoon as part of the alien\\'s\\n     bizarre life cycle.\\n\\n     Finally there is only one man left alive, alone on the ship with the\\n     creature, and only six hours till his air runs out; which leads to a\\n     climax of horrifying, explosive jeopardy, the outcome of which\\n     determines who will reach Earth alive -- man or alien.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n<b>                         CAST OF CHARACTERS\\n</b>\\n<b>     CHAZ STANDARD,\\n</b>          Captain.................A leader and a politician.

He is no sooner in the\\n     seat than he hits the \"LAUNCH\" button.\\n\\n     <u>EXTERIOR - NOSE OF SHIP - OUTER SPACE</u>\\n\\n     The retainer clips drop away, and with a blast of ramjets, THE\\n<b>     LIFEBOAT IS LAUNCHED AWAY FROM THE \"SNARK.\"\\n</b>\\n     <u>INTERIOR - LIFEBOAT</u>\\n\\n     Roby is frantically strapping himself in, as the lifeboat accelerates\\n     away from the mother ship.\\n\\n     <u>EXTERIOR - SPACE</u>\\n\\n     The tiny pod of the lifeboat accelerates away from the larger bulk of\\n     the SNARK.  The scene is strangely serene for such deadly\\n     circumstances.\\n\\n     <u>INTERIOR - LIFEBOAT</u>\\n\\n     Roby finishes strapping himself in, then he reaches and grabs the\\n     catbox.  The cat is YOWLING.  Roby hugs the box to his chest and hunches\\n     his head down over it.\\n\\n     <u>EXTERIOR - SPACE</u>\\n\\n     The SNARK drifts ever farther away as the lifeboat leaves it behind,\\n     until it is barely a point of light.\\n\\n<b>     THEN IT BLOWS UP.\\n</b>\\n<b>     AN EXPANDING ORANGE FIREBALL WITH PIECES OF METAL FLYING IN ALL\\n</b><b>     DIRECTIONS.\\n</b>\\n     <u>INTERIOR - LIFEBOAT</u>\\n\\n     The shockwave hits the escape craft, jolting it and rattling\\n     everything inside.  Then all is quiet.\\n\\n     Roby unhooks himself from his straps, rises, and goes to the back of\\n     the lifeboat.  He stares out through the porthole.  His face is bathed\\n     in orange light.\\n\\n     <u>EXTERIOR - SPACE</u>\\n\\n     What he sees is the boiling fireball, now fading and fizzling away\\n     into nothingness, and a couple of pieces of debris floating past.\\n\\n     <u>INTERIOR - LIFEBOAT</u>\\n\\n     Roby\\'s expression is mournful as he watches the final obliteration of\\n     his ship and friends.\\n\\n<b>     BEHIND HIM, THE CREATURE EMERGES FROM SOME HIDING PLACE -- IT HAS BEEN\\n</b><b>     INSIDE THE LIFEBOAT ALL ALONG.\\n</b>\\n     The cat SCREECHES.\\n\\n     Roby whirls, and finds himself facing the thing across the length of\\n     the boat.  It squats, then pulls out its trophy -- a man\\'s arm.\\n\\n     It begins to eat the arm, watching Roby.\\n\\n     His first thought is for the flamethrower -- unfortunately, it lies on\\n     the floor right next to the monster.  Next he glances around for any\\n     place to hide.  His eye falls on a tiny locker containing a space suit,\\n     with the door standing open.\\n\\n     He begins to edge toward the locker.  The creature rises.  He freezes.\\n\\n     It throws down the arm.  With that, Roby dives for the open locker\\n     door, hurls himself inside, and slams the door shut.\\n\\n     <u>INTERIOR - SPACESUIT LOCKER</u>\\n\\n     There is a clear glass panel in the door, and the thing puts its face\\n     right up to the glass, peering in at Roby.  The locker is so small that\\n     Roby\\'s face is only inches away from the creature\\'s.  The sight is\\n     disgusting.  It turns its head, looking at him in curiosity.\\n\\n     Then the MOANING OF THE CAT distracts it.\\n\\n     <u>INTERIOR - LIFEBOAT</u>\\n\\n     The creature waddles over to where the pressurized catbox sits.  It\\n     bends down and peers inside.  The CAT YOWLS LOUDER.\\n\\n     It picks up the catbox in its tentacles.\\n\\n     <u>INTERIOR - SPACESUIT LOCKER</u>\\n\\n     Trying to distract the monster away from the cat, Roby TAPS ON THE\\n<b>     GLASS.\\n</b>\\n     But the monster reacts so fast that its face is instantly back at the\\n     glass, startling the hell out of Roby.\\n\\n     Getting no more interference from him, the thing returns to the\\n     catbox.\\n\\n     Roby looks around.  He spies the spacesuit.  Quickly, he begins to pull\\n     it on.\\n\\n     <u>INTERIOR - LIFEBOAT</u>\\n\\n     The creature picks the catbox up in its tentacles and shakes it to see\\n     if there is anything inside.  The cat MOANS.\\n\\n     <u>INTERIOR - SPACESUIT LOCKER</u>\\n\\n     Roby is halfway into the pressure suit.\\n\\n     <u>INTERIOR - LIFEBOAT</u>\\n\\n     The creature throws the catbox down.  It clangs, and bounces.  The thing\\n     picks it up again and hammers it against the wall.  Then it jams it\\n     into a crevice in the wall.\\n\\n     With one tentacle, it begins to pound the sealed catbox into the\\n     crevice.  The cat has gone beyond hysterics.\\n\\n     <u>INTERIOR - SPACESUIT LOCKER</u>\\n\\n     Roby pulls on the helmet, latches it into place, then turns on the\\n     oxygen.  With a hiss, the suit fills itself.\\n\\n     In a rack on the wall is a long metal rod with a blunt rubber tip.\\n     Roby peels the rubber off, revealing a sharp steel point.\\n\\n     Again he raps on the glass.\\n\\n     <u>INTERIOR - LIFEBOAT</u>\\n\\n     The creature turns.  It faces the locker, peers at him.\\n\\n     <u>INTERIOR - SPACESUIT LOCKER</u>\\n\\n<b>                              ROBY\\n</b>               Try a little of this, you fucking\\n               bastard.\\n\\n<b>     HE KICKS THE DOOR OPEN.\\n</b>\\n     <u>INTERIOR - LIFEBOAT</u>\\n\\n     The creature rises, but just in time to catch THE STEEL SHAFT RIGHT\\n<b>     THROUGH ITS MIDRIFF.\\n</b>\\n     IT MAKES A HORRIBLE NOISE AND CLUTCHES AT THE SPUR.  The yellow acid\\n     begins to flow from the wound.\\n\\n     Before the acid can touch the floor, Roby reaches back and pulls a\\n     switch -- BLOWING THE REAR HATCH.\\n\\n     In a poof, the tiny atmosphere in the lifeboat is sucked out into\\n     space -- and the bleeding creature along with it.

      "</b><b>SYNOPSIS\n",
      "</b>En route back to Earth from a far part of the galaxy, the crew of thestarship SNARK intercepts a transmission in an <u>alien language</u>,originating from a nearby storm-shrouded planet.Mankind has waited centuries to contact another form of intelligentlife in the universe -- they decide to land and investigate.Theirsearch takes them to a wrecked alien spacecraft whose doors gape open-- it is dead and abandoned.Inside they find, among other strangethings, the skeleton of one of the unearthly space travellers.Certain clues in the wrecked ship lead them across the hostile surfaceof the planet to a primitive stone pyramid, the only remnant of avanished civilization.Beneath this pyramid they find an ancient tombfull of fantastic artifacts.Lying dormant in the tomb are centuries-old spores, which are triggered into life by the men's presence.Aparasite emerges and fastens itself to one of the men's faces -- andcannot be removed.An examination by the ship's medical computer reveals that thecreature has inserted a tube down his throat, which is depositingsomething inside him.Then it is discovered that the parasite's bloodis a horribly corrosive acid which eats through metal -- they dare notkill it on the ship.Ultimately it is dislodged from its victim and ejected from the ship,and they blast off from the Hell-planet.However, before they can sealthemselves into suspended animation for the long voyage home, ahorrible little monster emerges from the victim's body -- it has beengrowing in him, deposited there by the parasite... and now it is looseon the ship.A series of ghastly adventures follow.They trap it in an air shaftand a man has to crawl down the shaft with a flamethrower -- it tearsa man's head off and runs away with his body -- a man is crushed inthe air lock door and the ship loses most of its air in a terrificwindstorm -- another man is burned to death and then eaten by thecreature -- and another is woven into a cocoon as part of the alien'sbizarre life cycle.Finally there is only one man left alive, alone on the ship with thecreature, and only six hours till his air runs out; which leads to aclimax of horrifying, explosive jeopardy, the outcome of whichdetermines who will reach Earth alive -- man or alien.<b>CAST OF CHARACTERS\n",

If any of #you believe you would have marched #differently, then ask yourself why #you participated in the clapping. #Lads, there is a great need in all #of us to be accepted. However, that #need can be like a nasty current, #whisking us away unless we\\'re strong #and determined swimmers. Don\\'t insist #on the separate path simply to be #different or contrary, but trust #what is unique about yourselves even #if it\\'s odd or unpopular. As Mr. #Robert Frost said, \"Two roads diverged #in a wood, and I... I took the one #less traveled by, And that has made #all the difference.\"#',\n",
