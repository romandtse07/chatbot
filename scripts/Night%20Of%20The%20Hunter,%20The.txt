SHOOTING DRAFT


1955




FULL SHOT -- THE STARLIT SKY


VOICE

And He opened His mouth and taught 

them, saying...


FADE sky to day.


LAP DISSOLVE TO:


LONG SHOT -- HELICOPTER -- OHIO RIVER COUNTRY


High over the country, CENTERING the winding river.


VOICE

Beware of false prophets...


LOWER LONG SHOT -- HELICOPTER -- RIVER COUNTRY


We approach a riverside village.


VOICE

...which come to you in sheep's 

clothing...


A CLOSER, LOWER HELICOPTER SHOT


We descend low over a deserted house; CHILDREN in yard run 

and hide; we hear "IT" counting "five, ten, fifteen, 

twenty..."


VOICE

...but inwardly they are ravening 

wolves.


MEDIUM SHOT -- "IT"


He finishes his count with a loud "Hundred" and turns, then:


"IT"

What's wrong?


We PAN as he comes towards a little boy, beside an open cellar 

door, who gestures towards the open door. "IT" looks down.


"IT"

(a low gasp)

Heyy!

(then he shouts to 

all and to us)

Heyy!


We DOLLY IN fast to, and TILT DOWN into open cellar, into:


CLOSE SHOT -- A LEG


A skeletal leg in a rotted fume of stocking and a high-heeled 

shoe. We HOLD a moment, then PULL UP and AWAY over the 

converging heads of several CHILDREN. A CHILD whimpers softly.


HELICOPTER SHOT


The yard and the CHILDREN, same angle and height as the last 

descending helicopter shot. We PULL BACK and AWAY.


VOICE

Ye shall know them by their fruits.


DISSOLVE TO:


HIGH LONG SHOT -- HELICOPTER


CENTERING the river.


VOICE

A good tree cannot bring forth evil 

fruit...


LOWER LONG SHOT (HELICOPTER)


CENTERING on open touring car, as it drives along a river 

road.


VOICE

Neither can a corrupt tree bring 

forth good fruit.


We STOOP LOW towards the car.


VOICE

Wherefore by their fruits ye shall 

know them.


CUT TO:


CLOSE SHOT -- PREACHER


He is the driver of the car. Pleasant river landscapes 

(PROCESS) flow behind him. He is dressed in dark clothes, a 

paper collar, a string tie. As he drives he talks to himself.


PREACHER

What's it to be, Lord, another widow? 

Has it been six? Twelve?... I 

disremember.


He nods, smiles, and touches his hat. We see a farm couple 

in a poor wagon.


PREACHER

You say the word, and I'm on my way.


LAP DISSOLVE TO:


CLOSE SHOT -- PREACHER DRIVING


He brakes his car in a small riverside town; then proceeds.


PREACHER

You always send me money to go forth 

and preach your Word.


A widow with a little wad of bills hidden away in the sugar-

bowl.


LAP DISSOLVE TO:


CLOSE SHOT -- PREACHER DRIVING


He shifts into second gear, climbing a steep little hill.


PREACHER

I am tired. Sometimes I wonder if 

you really understand.

(pause)

Not that you mind the killin's...


The stones of a country graveyard gleam in the last daylight.


PREACHER

Yore Book is full of killin's.


He starts fast and noisily down a steep hill.


PREACHER

But there are things you do hate, 

Lord: perfume-smellin' things -- 

lacy things -- things with curly 

hair --


CUT TO:


INT. A BURLESQUE HOUSE -- MEDIUM CLOSE SHOT -- A DANCER


She is hard at work, to music o.s.


FULL SHOT -- AUDIENCE -- CENTERING ON PREACHER, IN AISLE 

SEAT


Among the members of the sad burlesque audience, he is in 

strong contrast: a sour and aggressive expression. Music 

o.s. We MOVE IN fast to a HEAD CLOSE-UP.


MEDIUM CLOSE SHOT -- THE DANCER INSERT -- PREACHER'S LEFT 

HAND


Labeled H-A-T-E in tattoo across four knuckles, it grips and 

flexes.


INSERT -- HIS RIGHT HAND


Before we see the lettering he slides it into his pocket.


EXTREME CLOSE SHOT -- PREACHER


His head slants; a cold smile; one eyelid flutters.


INSERT -- RIGHT HAND AND POCKET


We hear the snapping open of a switch-blade knife and the 

point of the knife cuts through his clothes.


LESS EXTREME CLOSE SHOT -- PREACHER


He seems to "listen" for something.


PREACHER

No, there are too many of them; you 

can't kill a world.


A hand descends firmly onto his shoulder. He glances up behind 

him as we


TILT TO:


CLOSE SHOT -- A STATE TROOPER


He bends down and speaks quietly next PREACHER'S ear.


TROOPER

You driving an Essex tourin'-car 

with a Moundsville license?


LAP DISSOLVE TO:


INT. COURTROOM -- CLOSE THREE-SHOT -- JUDGE AND CLERK, OVER 

PREACHER


JUDGE

Harry Powell, for the theft of that 

touring car you will spend thirty 

days in the Moundsville Penitentiary.


PREACHER

(correcting Clerk)

Preacher Harry Powell.


JUDGE

A car thief! Picked up where you 

were! A man of God?

(to Clerk)

Harry Powell.


LAP DISSOLVE TO:


FULL SHOT -- MOUNDSVILLE PENITENTIARY -- DAY (HELICOPTER)


A grim stone turretted fa√ßade; an American flag idles at top 

center.


LAP DISSOLVE TO:


CLOSE DOWNWARD TWO-SHOT -- JOHN AND PEARL HARPER


They sit in the grass, a sentimental picture. JOHN is nine; 

PEARL is five. They are working together on PEARL'S doll; 

PEARL is dressing her, while JOHN gets on a difficult shoe.


PEARL HARPER

Stand still, Miss Jenny!


JOHN HARPER

(across her)

There! What's so hard about that!


He proudly exhibits the shod foot.


They hear the sound of an auto engine o.s. They look o.s. 

and get up, PEARL dangling the doll.


LONG SHOT -- OVER THE CHILDREN -- BEN HARPER'S FORD


A Model-T Ford approaches at maximal speed on uneven dirt 

road.


PEARL HARPER

(to John, happily)

Daddy!


The car careens towards us; then swings into the sideyard as 

we PAN, and stops.


They run towards their father fast; then JOHN looks puzzled 

and they stop short.


BEN HARPER half-falls out of the far door, his shoulder blood-

stained, his eyes wild. A hefty, simple man of thirty. He 

looks at them, dazed, across the car.


MEDIUM SHOT -- BEN HARPER


BEN HARPER

Where's your Mom?


JOHN HARPER

Out shopping -- you're bleeding, Dad --


BEN HARPER

Listen to me John.


On this he comes around clear of the car with a revolver in 

one hand and a bloody roll of banknotes in the other.


CLOSE SHOT -- JOHN


He screams. BEN slaps him with the back of the money hand, 

leaving blood on JOHN'S cheek.


CLOSE GROUP SHOT -- JOHN, BEN, PEARL


PEARL, and the house, are in BACKGROUND. PEARL just clutches 

her doll. During BEN'S next lines, JOHN touches his cheek 

and looks at the blood on his fingers and at the bloody money -- 

of which we FLASH-CUT an INSERT.


BEN HARPER

(rushing)

Listen! This money here! We got to 

hide it before they get me! There's 

close to ten thousand dollars.

(his eyes dart wildly)

Under a rock in the smokehouse? Ah 

no. Under the bricks in the grape 

arbor? No, they'd dig for it.


CLOSE SHOT -- BEN


BEN HARPER

(sudden triumph)

Why sure! That's the place!


He moves forward and OUT and in his place we see two police 

cars, small in distance, coming fast. We hear sirens.


INT. FRONT POLICE CAR -- THROUGH WINDSHIELD


...and OVER two STATE TROOPERS. They move at high speed, 

with sirens. BEN and his CHILDREN, tiny in the distance, 

dilate.


TROOPER

(driving)

That's him.


2ND TROOPER

(over his shoulder, 

as if to us)

He prob'ly still has that gun.


CLOSE GROUP SHOT -- BEN AND CHILDREN


...police cars approaching in BACKGROUND. PEARL hugs her 

doll. JOHN is dazed. BEN stands, pistol in hand.


BEN HARPER

Here they come.


JOHN HARPER

Dad, you're bleeding...


He grabs JOHN'S shoulder and stoops as we TIGHTEN IN.


BEN HARPER

Listen to me son. You got to swear. 

Swear means promise. First swear 

you'll take care of little Pearl. 

Guard her with your life, boy. Then 

swear you won't never tell where 

that money's hid. Not even your Mom.


JOHN HARPER

Yes, Dad.


BEN HARPER

You understand?


JOHN HARPER

Not even her?


In b.g. the TROOPERS get out of their cars and fan out 

cautiously to surround BEN: guns in hand.


BEN HARPER

You got common sense. She ain't. 

When you grow up that money'll be 

yours. Now swear. "I will guard Pearl 

with my life..."


JOHN HARPER

(fumbling)

I will guard Pearl with my life...


BEN HARPER

..."and I won't never tell about the 

money."


JOHN HARPER

And I won't never tell about the 

money.


PEARL HARPER

You, Pearl. You swear too.


CLOSE SHOT -- PEARL


PEARL HARPER

(giggling)

Who's them Blue Men yonder?


HEAD CLOSE-UP -- JOHN


JOHN HARPER

(under breath)

Blue men.


GROUP SHOT -- TROOPERS IN BACKGROUND


A TROOPER

Ben Harper!


BEN HARPER

I'm goin' now children. Goodbye.


BEN backs away from his CHILDREN, raising his hands, gun in 

one hand. We PULL BACK a little, enlarging the GROUP SHOT 

and the role of the TROOPERS in it.


TROOPER

Drop that gun, Harper. We don't want 

them kids hurt.


TWO TROOPERS approach BEN from behind.


BEN HARPER

Just mind what you swore, son. Mind, 

boy!


GROUP SHOT -- JOHN


He runs forward and clasps his stomach, with his mouth open.


MEDIUM SHOT -- BEN AND TROOPERS -- JOHN'S VIEWPOINT


One TROOPER smacks the back of BEN'S head with a pistol 

barrel.


CLOSE SHOT -- JOHN


JOHN HARPER

(shouting; a sickly 

smile)

Don't!


MEDIUM SHOT -- BEN AND TROOPERS -- AS BEFORE


Another TROOPER, with a pistol barrel, knocks the pistol 

from BEN'S lifted hand.


CLOSE SHOT -- JOHN


JOHN HARPER

(shouting)

Don't!


BEN sinks to his knees as both men, and two others from the 

front, close in on him.


HEAD CLOSE-UP -- JOHN


JOHN HARPER

Dad!


He takes in the GROUP with his mouth open. o.s. we hear the 

slamming of car doors, and car starting away.


FULL SHOT -- JOHN'S VIEWPOINT -- THE CARS


They drive away fast in road dust.


THREE-SHOT -- THE CHILDREN AND WILLA HARPER


Carrying a shopping bag, their mother, WILLA, runs up from 

BACKGROUND between the CHILDREN, looking always to cars o.s.


CLOSE SHOT -- WILLA


She has a rich body.


RESUME THREE-SHOT


PEARL comes to her and she picks up PEARL and the doll; JOHN, 

laden with his oath, walks quickly into the house. WILLA 

does a bewildered take, then looks again towards the cars 

o.s.


LAP DISSOLVE TO:


INT. COURTROOM -- CLOSE THREE-SHOT -- JUDGE AND CLERK, OVER 

BEN


JUDGE

Ben Harper, it is the sentence of 

this Court that for the murder of Ed 

Smiley and Corey South, you be hanged 

by the neck until you are dead, and 

may God have mercy on your soul.


LAP DISSOLVE TO:


FULL SHOT -- THE MOUNDSVILLE PENITENTIARY SAME VIEW AS 

BEFORE; BUT NOW IT IS NIGHT


LAP DISSOLVE TO:


INT. BEN'S CELL -- NIGHT -- CLOSE DOWN-SHOT -- BEN


He lies on his back, chuckling and murmuring indistinctly in 

his sleep.


BEN HARPER

I got you all buffaloed! You ain't 

never gonna git it outen me; not 

none o' you!


PREACHER'S VOICE

(o.s., very low)

Where, Ben? Where? Where?


BEN HARPER

(distinctly)

And a little child shall lead them.


CLOSE TWO-SHOT -- NEW ANGLE -- BEN, THEN PREACHER


BEN lies in profile. From the bunk above, the face of PREACHER 

stretches down into the SHOT, upside down, snake-like.


PREACHER

(softly)

Come on, boy: tell me.


BEN wakes, sees PREACHER, and hits him so hard in the face 

that he falls from bunk to floor. PREACHER collects himself 

into a squat, nursing his face. BEN sits up in bed.


PREACHER

(with wholesome dignity)

Ben, I'm a Man of God.


BEN HARPER

Tryin' to make me talk about it in 

my sleep!


PREACHER

No, Ben.


BEN HARPER

What'd I say?

(he grabs Preacher's 

throat and shakes 

him)

What? What? What? What?


PREACHER

(choking)

You was quotin' Scripture. You said -- 

you said, "And a little child shall 

lead them."


BEN HARPER

Hm!


He lies back, amused. PREACHER sits on the bedside; manner 

of a parson visiting the sick.


PREACHER

(gravely)

You killed two men, Ben Harper.


BEN HARPER

That's right, Preacher. I robbed 

that bank because I got tired of 

seein' children roamin' the woodlands 

without food, children roamin' the 

highways in this year of Depression; 

children sleepin' in old abandoned 

car bodies on junk-heaps; and I 

promised myself I'd never see the 

day when my youngins'd want.


PREACHER

With that ten thousand dollars I 

could build a Tabernacle that'd make 

the Wheeling Island Tabernacle look 

like a chicken-house!


BEN HARPER

Would you have free candy for the 

kids, Preacher?


He picks up and wads a sock.


PREACHER

Think of it, Ben! With that cursed, 

bloodied gold!


BEN HARPER

How come you got that stickknife hid 

in your bed-blankets, Preacher?


PREACHER

I come not with Peace but with a 

Sword.


BEN HARPER

You, Preacher?


PREACHER gets and pockets the knife.


PREACHER

That Sword has served me through 

many an evil time, Ben Harper.


BEN HARPER

What religion do you profess, 

Preacher?


PREACHER

The religion the Almighty and me 

worked out betwixt us.


BEN HARPER

(contemptuously)

I'll bet.


PREACHER

Salvation is a last-minute business, 

boy.


BEN HARPER

(sock near mouth)

Keep talkin', Preacher.


PREACHER

If you was to let that money serve 

the Lord's purposes, He might feel 

kindly turned towards you.


BEN HARPER

Keep talkin', Preacher.


He wads the sock into his mouth and lies back, sardonic.


PREACHER

(his voice fading 

into Dissolve)

You reckon the Lord wouldn't change 

his mind about you if...


DISSOLVE TO:


EXT. PENITENTIARY COURTYARD -- NIGHT


DISSOLVE TO:


INSERT -- PREACHER'S HANDS


They rest on sill of cell window, the lettered fingers 

legible. The right hand is lettered L-O-V-E. The hands open, 

disclosing his open knife. They close over it.


CLOSE SHOT -- PREACHER, AT CELL WINDOW


His eyes lift from his hands, heavenward. Moonlight on his 

face. He prays, quietly.


PREACHER

Lord You sure knowed what You was 

doin' when You brung me to this very 

cell at this very time. A man with 

ten thousand dollars hid somewheres, 

and a widder in the makin'.


DISSOLVE TO:


EXT. PENITENTIARY COURTYARD -- NIGHT


Same SHOT as before, but now, prison lights are on; and a 

man, a prison GUARD, waits close inside door. BART the HANGMAN 

joins him with a silent salute. BART wears a hard derby.


EXT. PENITENTIARY -- THE DOOR -- (REVERSE)


They walk in silence into MEDIUM, MOVING SHOT, the GUARD 

talkative, BART reluctant to talk.


The Penitentiary recedes in b.g.


GUARD

Any trouble?


BART

No.


GUARD

He was a cool one, that Harper. Never 

broke.


BART

He carried on some; kicked.


EXT. BART'S HOUSE -- MEDIUM SHOT -- BART AND GUARD


On porch, by door, is a doll's perambulator. BART and GUARD 

walk into the SHOT.


GUARD stops, BART starts up his front steps.


GUARD

He never told about the money.


BART

(walking up steps)

No.


GUARD

What do you figure he done with it?


BART

(turning, at door)

He took the secret with him when I 

dropped him.


The GUARD leaves the SHOT; BART goes in.


INT. BART'S HALLWAY -- CLOSE SHOT -- BART


He hangs up his coat and hat. Across this his wife speaks 

o.s.; a lighted door is ajar at rear of hall. A clatter of 

dishes and pans o.s.


BART'S WIFE

(o.s.)

That you, Bart? Supper's waitin'.


BART just nods, and, tiptoeing, walks into a door next the 

kitchen and snaps on a light and turns on water o.s. His 

wife comes out of the kitchen and goes in.


INT. BART'S BATHROOM -- CLOSE TWO-SHOT -- BART AND WIFE


He is washing his hands in thick lather. Passing, she pecks 

his cheek and, as we PAN, looks into the next room. He looks 

past her, and we see two small CHILDREN asleep in a big brass 

bed. BART registers, turns again to the basin, and we PAN 

them back into the original TWO-SHOT.


BART

(low)

Mother: sometimes I think it might 

be better if I was to quit my job as 

guard.


His WIFE'S eyes go sharp and quiet.


WIFE

(low)

You're always this way when there's 

a hangin'. You never have to be there.


BART rinses his hands. A sigh; he takes up the towel.


BART

Sometimes I wish I was back at the 

mine.


WIFE

And leave me a widow after another 

blast like the one in '24? Not on 

your life, old mister!


He looks at her a moment. She goes out. He looks o.s. towards 

his CHILDREN. He goes into their room on tiptoe.


MEDIUM SHOT -- BART


He approaches his children, across whose bed WE SHOOT without 

yet seeing them. He comes into MEDIUM CLOSE-UP. As he leans 

and we TILT DOWN, he extends his large hands.


CLOSE DOWNWARD TWO-SHOT -- HIS CHILDREN


Two rose-and-gold little GIRLS lie in sleep; BART'S hands 

enter the SHOT and gently rearrange the covers so that their 

mouths and throats are free. We watch, for a moment more, 

the two sleeping faces.


LAP DISSOLVE TO:


HEAD CLOSE-UP -- BART, HOVERING HIS CHILDREN


CHILDREN'S VOICES

(o.s. chanting)

Hing, hang, hung. See what the Hangman 

done!


LAP DISSOLVE TO:


EXT. CRESAP'S LANDING -- DAY


We are in Peacock Alley. The tree-shaded dirt street of a 

small, one-street river town; a picturesque, mid-19th-century 

remnant of the old river civilization, which general progress 

has left behind. Chiefly we see, in this order: A schoolhouse 

(on far side of street); Miz Cunningham's second-hand shop; 

a Grange House sporting a poster for a Western movie; Spoon's 

Ice Cream Parlor. At the end of this street, down the river-

bank, is a brick wharf and UNCLE BIRDIE'S wharf-boat. In 

b.g. and in passing, suggestions of sleepy small-town life.


From the HEAD CLOSE-UP of BART the Hangman o.s. chanting, we


LAP DISSOLVE TO:


HEAD CLOSE-UP -- JOHN HARPER


Chanting VOICES o.s. complete "see what the Hangman done!"


PULL BACK TO:


CLOSE PULLING TWO-SHOT -- PEARL AND JOHN


They stroll barefoot down the empty dirt sidewalk. They look 

towards the voices, PEARL friendly, JOHN hostile.


MEDIUM SHOT -- THE CHILDREN, OVER JOHN AND PEARL


Several, within the door of the Schoolhouse, stick their 

heads around the edge. They chant at the HARPER CHILDREN. 

Another, next the door, is drawing something on the wall.


CHILDREN

(chanting)

Hung, hang, hing! See the Robber 

swing!


OVER these lines we CUT briefly to --


CLOSER SHOT -- THE CHILDREN


...chanting, drawing. The ARTIST completes in chalk, a large 

simple sketch of a man hanging from gallows. As the verse 

ends we CUT TO:


MEDIUM SHOT -- THE CHILDREN, OVER JOHN AND PEARL


They look towards OUR CHILDREN; JOHN pays them no attention. 

The drawing is revealed. JOHN takes PEARL'S hand. The other 

CHILDREN giggle.


CHILDREN

(chanting)

Hing, hang, hung! Now my song is 

done!


Between lines one and two JOHN turns away from them into --


CLOSE TWO-SHOT -- JOHN AND PEARL -- THROUGH WINDOW


We SHOOT them through the window of MIZ CUNNINGHAM'S second-

hand store. The back of a watch is silhouetted large in 

FOREGROUND; JOHN'S eyes instantly fix on it; in b.g. the 

SCHOOL-CHILDREN finish their song and vanish, giggling, into 

the schoolhouse. We hear the ticking of the watch.


INSERT -- THE WATCH


A watch with a moving sweep-hand, ticking.


CLOSE TWO-SHOT -- JOHN AND PEARL


PEARL HARPER

Are you goin' to buy it, John?


No answer. JOHN'S eyes are fixed on the watch. OVER a shop-

doorbell we hear:


MIZ CUNNINGHAM'S VOICE

(o.s.)

Uh-Hawwww!

(They glance toward 

her.)


MEDIUM SHOT -- MIZ CUNNINGHAM


Fantastically dirty and fantastically dressed, she hustles 

to them and we PAN her into a THREE-SHOT. She talks like a 

Tidewater Cockatoo.


MIZ CUNNINGHAM

(continuing)

So your Mommy's keepin' you out of 

school! Poor little lambs!


PEARL watches her; JOHN, the watch.


MIZ CUNNINGHAM

And how is your poor, poor mother?


JOHN HARPER

She's at Spoon's Ice Cream Parlor.


MIZ CUNNINGHAM

(she snuffles)

The Lord tends you both these days!


JOHN doesn't take his eyes off the watch.


CLOSE SHOT -- JOHN


His eyes are fixed on the watch o.s.


MIZ CUNNINGHAM'S VOICE

(o.s.)

Didn't they never find out what your 

father done with all that money he 

stole?


Eyes as before till "money," then he looks up towards her.


MEDIUM SHOT -- MIZ CUNNINGHAM


MIZ CUNNINGHAM

When they caught him, there wasn't 

so much as a penny of it to be seen! 

Now what do you make of that! Eh, 

boy?


She grins horribly.


TWO-SHOT -- OVER JOHN AND PEARL


JOHN HARPER

Pearl and me, we have to go.


He walks off fast as we DOLLY BEHIND THEM; he leads PEARL, 

who hugs her doll.


PEARL HARPER

(chanting)

Hing, hang, hung.


JOHN HARPER

You better not sing that song.


PEARL HARPER

Why?


JOHN HARPER

'Cause you're too little.


A few paces in silence; now they come to the big window of 

Spoon's Ice Cream Parlor.


PEARL HARPER

Can we get some candy?


WILLA'S face is seen within; serving a customer, she sees 

them and waves them away.


JOHN HARPER

No.


He keeps her strolling. WALT SPOON, comes out, proffering 

two lollypops.


WALT

Howdy, youngins.


PEARL drags at JOHN'S hand but JOHN, pretending not to see 

or hear, drags her out of the SHOT, shaking his head. We 

DOLLY IN on WALT, who looks after them, surprised and touched, 

then goes inside.


INT. SPOON'S PARLOR -- GROUP SHOT -- WALT, WILLA, ICEY SPOON


We PAN WALT across a little of his Parlor; he plants the 

lollypops back in a jar on the counter and leaves the SHOT 

as we TIGHTEN IN on WILLA and ICEY. WILLA slides used dishes 

into wash-water; ICEY jaws down her back, from first moment 

of shot.


ICEY SPOON

Willa Harper there is certain plain 

facts of life that adds up just like 

two plus two makes four and one of 

them is this: No woman is good enough 

to raise growin' youngsters alone! 

The Lord meant that job for two!


WILLA HARPER

Icey, I don't want a husband.


CLOSE SHOT -- ICEY


ICEY SPOON

(fiercely)

Fiddlesticks!


LAP DISSOLVE TO:


FULL SHOT -- EXT. STREET -- NIGHT


The weekly movie audience is letting out, next door to 

SPOON'S. Some start cars or wagons, others stroll to SPOON'S.


LAP DISSOLVE TO:


INT. SPOON'S PARLOR -- EVENING -- TWO-SHOT -- ICEY AND WILLA


We start with a CLOSE SHOT as ICEY'S hands slap together a 

gooey banana split; TILT UP to TWO-SHOT, favoring ICEY; finish 

on WILLA, on "it's a man you need," etc.


Murmur of CUSTOMERS o.s.


WALT'S VOICE

(calling o.s.)

One solid brown sody, one Lovers' 

Delight.


ICEY SPOON

'Tain't a matter of wantin' or not 

wantin'! You're no spring chicken, 

you're a grown woman with two little 

youngins; it's a man you need in the 

house, Willa Harper!


LAP DISSOLVE TO:


LONG SHOT -- NIGHT -- A TRAIN


A short, lighted, toy-like train departs the town along the 

river-bank, whistling. The whistle TIES OVER the previous 

DISSOLVE. STARLIT SKY.


LAP DISSOLVE TO:


FRAMING SHOT -- EXT. HARPER HOUSE -- NIGHT


A square, HEAD-ON SHOT, river water below and vibrant 

starlight above; featuring a gas-lamp by the road; a tree; 

and pretty tree-shadows which work across a window.


INT. HARPER CHILDREN'S BEDROOM -- NIGHT -- TWO-SHOT -- JOHN, 

PEARL, SHADOWS


PEARL lies in their bed, her doll snug on her shoulder. JOHN 

sits on the edge of the bed, in his underwear.


PEARL HARPER

Tell me a story, John.


JOHN HARPER

Once upon a time there was a rich 

king...

(he sees the shadows 

on the wall and gets 

up and looks at them)

...and he had him a son and a daughter 

and they all lived in a castle over 

in Africa. Well, one day this King 

got taken away by bad men and before 

he got took off he told his son to 

kill anyone that tried to steal their 

gold, and before long these bad men 

come back and --


PEARL HARPER

The Blue Men?


He moves, and as his shadow moves away we see the shadow of 

PREACHER, motionless. PEARL sits up and points at it. JOHN 

notices her and sees it. We PAN JOHN to the window. He looks 

out.


FULL SHOT -- PREACHER -- THROUGH WINDOW, JOHN'S VIEWPOINT.


He stands motionless.


RESUME PREVIOUS SHOT -- JOHN AT WINDOW


He turns and we PAN him to bed.


JOHN HARPER

(casually)

Just a man.

(he climbs into bed 

and pulls up the 

covers)

Goodnight Pearl, sleep tight; and 

don't let the bedbugs bite.


PEARL HARPER

(to doll)

'Night Miss Jenny; don't let the 

bedbugs bite.


As they settle down we hear PREACHER'S singing, sweet and 

quiet o.s.: "Leaning on the Everlasting Arms."


DISSOLVE TO: 


EXT. RIVER AND TOWN -- MORNING -- FULL SHOT -- A GINGERBREAD 

SIDE-WHEELER


She steams around a bend towards a toy-like small town. 

PREACHER'S song, o.s., ties over. People are waving from 

shore and boat.


FULL PANNING SHOT -- THE BOAT, FROM SHORE


We PAN her into frame UNCLE BIRDIE STEPTOE'S toy-like little 

wharf-boat. As she passes broadside we CUT TO:


MEDIUM SHOT -- BIRDIE, THEN JOHN


...as boat passes. BIRDIE'S head sticks through a porthole. 

He is a wiry old river character. The boat whistles. As BIRDIE 

speaks we PAN JOHN, and foundered skiff, into TWO-SHOT with 

BIRDIE.


BIRDIE STEPTOE

She don't put in at Cresap's Landing 

no more, but she still blows as she 

passes. Come on in and have a cup of 

coffee.


JOHN HARPER

(starting towards him)

Ain't nobody stole Dad's skiff.


BIRDIE STEPTOE

Ain't nobody goin' to neither, long 

as Uncle Birdie's around.


He vanishes from the porthole. We PAN JOHN from skiff to 

wharf and Birdie's door.


BIRDIE'S VOICE

(calling o.s.)

First day my jints is limber enough 

I'll haul her up and give her a good 

caulkin'.


INT. BIRDIE'S BOAT -- TWO-SHOT -- JOHN AND BIRDIE


JOHN enters and sits on a box. BIRDIE, in a ramshackle rocking 

chair, pours coffee. BESS'S photograph on chest near BIRDIE.


BIRDIE STEPTOE

Ain't seen you in a coon's age, 

Johnny.


JOHN HARPER

I been mindin' Pearl.


BIRDIE STEPTOE

Pshaw now! Ain't it a caution what 

women'll load onto a feller's back 

when he ain't lookin'?


He gives JOHN a cup of coffee.


BIRDIE STEPTOE

'Scuse me, Cap, while I sweeten up 

my coffee.


He fetches a liquor bottle from beneath the rocking chair; 

about to pour he does a take at BESS'S PHOTOGRAPH.


INSERT -- THE PHOTOGRAPH


It stands in a cabinet frame: A fine-looking young woman in 

archaic dress, with sharp, accusing black eyes.


BIRDIE'S VOICE

(o.s.)

Dead and gone these twenty-five years 

and never takes her eyes off me.


CUT OVER his line to --


CLOSE TWO-SHOT -- JOHN AND BIRDIE


He turns the picture away and splashes liquor into his coffee.


BIRDIE STEPTOE

(pouring)

Man o' my years needs a little snort 

to get his boiler heated of a morning.


They drink. BIRDIE, satisfied, sighs and rocks.


BIRDIE STEPTOE

This mornin' I was talkin' to this 

stranger up at the boarding-house. 

He knowed your Dad!


CLOSE SHOT -- JOHN


JOHN looks cautious.


JOHN HARPER

Where did he know Dad?


CLOSE SHOT -- BIRDIE


BIRDIE'S face falls; he takes another drink.


BIRDIE STEPTOE

Well, boy, I'll not hide the truth; 

it was up at Moundsville Penitentiary.


CLOSE TWO-SHOT -- NEW ANGLE


JOHN puts his cup down and gets up.


JOHN HARPER

I got to go now, Uncle Birdie.


He heads for the door.


BIRDIE STEPTOE

Why shucks boy, you just got here.


He follows JOHN to the door. JOHN runs up the bank, not 

looking back.


JOHN HARPER

(running)

I told Mom I'd be back to Spoon's 

for Pearl.


EXT. STREET -- MEDIUM SHOT -- JOHN


He runs up the street close to Spoon's and stops dead.


CLOSE SHOT -- JOHN


He is horrified by what he sees.


INT. SPOON'S ICE CREAM PARLOR


GROUP SHOT through door-glass, from JOHN'S VIEW POINT 

PREACHER, WILLA and PEARL surround a little table. WALT stands 

by, puffing his pipe. ICEY in BACKGROUND, stirs fudge at a 

little soda-fountain stove. WILLA looks both moved and 

pleased. PEARL, shyly flirting with PREACHER, all but hides 

in WILLA'S skirts. PREACHER dandles PEARL'S doll on his knee 

as he talks. All the grownups are avid for his words, which 

we don't hear through the glass.


CLOSE SHOT -- JOHN


We SHOOT THROUGH the DOOR; he quietly enters.


GROUP SHOT


They look casually to JOHN, and continue talking.


ICEY SPOON

(stirring; with a 

meaningful glance at 

Willa)

God works in a mysterious way, His 

wonders to perform.


OVER this JOHN ENTERS the SHOT and stands at the fringe of 

the GROUP, staring at PREACHER'S hands and at the doll.


PREACHER

I was with Brother Harper almost to 

the end;...


GROUP SHOT -- NEW ANGLE -- FAVORING JOHN AND PREACHER


PREACHER

(continuing)

...and now that I'm no longer employed 

by the Penitentiary it is my joy to 

bring this small comfort to his loved 

ones.


FLASH-CUT CLOSE-UP -- JOHN


On "Penitentiary" he glances quickly at PREACHER'S face; 

then back to his hands.


GROUP SHOT -- ICEY


ICEY SPOON

(sniffing)

It's a mighty good man would come 

out of his way to bring a word of 

cheer to a grieving widow!


CLOSE SHOT -- WALT


WALT

So you ain't with the State no more?


GROUP SHOT -- FAVORING PREACHER AND JOHN


PREACHER

No, Brother; I resigned only 

yesterday. The heart-renderin' 

spectacle of them poor men was too 

much for me.


He becomes aware of JOHN'S staring.


PREACHER

Ah, little lad, you're staring at my 

fingers.


He hands the doll to PEARL. JOHN'S eyes follow the doll. 

PREACHER holds up both hands to JOHN. JOHN looks back at his 

hands.


PREACHER

Shall I tell you the little story of 

Right-Hand-Left-Hand -- the tale of 

Good and Evil?


JOHN stands still. PEARL, with her doll, crosses to PREACHER 

and twines about his knee.


CLOSE SHOT -- JOHN


He looks on, in dumb alarm.


CLOSE SHOT -- PREACHER


PREACHER

H-A-T-E!

(he thrusts up his 

left hand)

It was with this left hand that old 

brother Cain struck the blow that 

laid his brother low! L-O-V-E!

(he thrusts up his 

right hand)

See these here fingers, dear friends! 

These fingers has veins that lead 

straight to the soul of man! The 

right hand, friends! The hand of 

Love!


GROUP SHOT -- ICEY, WALT, WILLA -- OVER PREACHER'S HANDS


They are impressed in their different ways.


PREACHER

(o.s.)

Now watch and I'll show you the Story 

of Life. The fingers of these hands, 

dear hearts! -- They're always a-

tuggin' and a-warrin' one hand agin' 

t'other.

(he locks his fingers 

and writhes them, 

crackling the joints)

Look at 'em, dear hearts!


MEDIUM SHOT -- JOHN -- OVER PREACHER'S HANDS


He looks on with unseeing eyes.


PREACHER

(o.s.)

Old Left Hand Hate's a-fightin' and 

it looks like Old Right Hand Love's 

a goner!


GROUP SHOT -- WALT, ICEY, WILLA, OVER HANDS


PREACHER

But wait now! Hot dog! Love's a-

winnin! Yessirree!


CLOSE SHOT -- PREACHER


PREACHER

It's Love that won! Old Left Hand 

Hate's gone down for the count!

(he crashes both hands 

onto the table)


FULL SHOT -- THE WHOLE GROUP


Slight applause from the ADULTS. PREACHER takes PEARL, with 

her doll, onto his lap.


ICEY SPOON

I never heard it better told. I wish 

every soul in this community could 

git the benefit. You jest got to 

stay for our church pick-nick Sunday!


PEARL offers PREACHER the DOLL to kiss. PREACHER complies.


CLOSE SHOT -- JOHN'S REACTION


RESUME GROUP SHOT


PREACHER

(finessing it)

I must wend my way down River on the 

Lord's work.


ICEY SPOON

You ain't leavin' in no hurry if we 

can help it!


WILLA HARPER

John: take that look offen your face 

and act nice.


PREACHER

He don't mean no impudence; do you, 

boy?

(no answer)

Do you, boy? Ah, many's the time 

poor Brother Ben told me about these 

youngins.


JOHN HARPER

What did he tell you?


CLOSE SHOT -- PREACHER


He does a little take. His eyes twinkle palely.


PREACHER

Why, he told me what fine little 

lambs you and your sister both was.


GROUP SHOT


JOHN HARPER

Is that all?


CLOSE SHOT -- PREACHER


Something new enters his eyes; a game has begun between them.


PREACHER

Why, no, boy; he told me lots and 

lots of things. Nice things, boy.


A tight silence. ICEY pours fudge into a buttered pan.


PREACHER

My, that fudge smells yummy!


CLOSE SHOT -- ICEY


ICEY SPOON

(with horrid archness)

It's for the pick-nick. And you won't 

get a smidgen of my fudge unless you 

stay for the pick-nick!


Over her line, o.s., hymn-singing begins and now, OVER her 

"the case rests" smile we bring up the singing and


LAP DISSOLVE TO:


EXT. THE RIVER BANK -- CHURCH IN BACKGROUND -- FULL SHOT -- 

THE SINGING PICKNICKERS


A pleasant, grassy river-bank. Few men in proportion to women 

and children. We CENTER PREACHER. They are singing "Brighten 

the Corner;" PREACHER sings conspicuously well. The women 

watch him and admire him. He gives WILLA the eye as we PAN 

to CENTER WILLA, who looks wooed and self-conscious. ICEY 

enters the SHOT and whispers and beckons WILLA and, as the 

singing continues, they leave the group and start towards a 

shade tree in MEDIUM GROUND, which we PAN TO CENTER.


FULL SHOT -- WILLA AND ICEY


They walk; singers in BACKGROUND.


ICEY SPOON

Don't he have the grandest singin' 

voice?


WILLA nods. ICEY, looking ahead, is displeased.


MEDIUM SHOT -- THE TREE, JOHN AND PEARL


They sit on the bench, their backs to us, partly concealed 

by the tree trunk.


ICEY'S VOICE

(sharp)

John! Pearl!


They look around. ICEY and WILLA enter the SHOT, their backs 

to us.


ICEY SPOON

Run along and play, you two.


JOHN HARPER

Where?


ICEY SPOON

Down by the river. My goodness!


Docile, they leave the shot as WILLA and ICEY approach the 

bench.


CLOSE TWO-SHOT -- WILLA AND ICEY


They sit on the bench, their back to us. The CHILDREN recede 

towards the river in BACKGROUND. WILLA meekly keeps her head 

down. Singing continues o.s.


ICEY SPOON

That feller's just achin' to settle 

down with some nice woman and make a 

home for himself.


WILLA HARPER

It's awful soon after Ben's passing.


ICEY SPOON

If ever I saw a Sign from Heaven!


WILLA HARPER

John don't like him much.


ICEY SPOON

Pearl dotes on him.


WILLA HARPER

The boy worries me. It's silly, but 

it's like there was something still 

between him and his Dad.


ICEY SPOON

What he needs is a dose o' salts!


WILLA HARPER

There's something else.


ICEY SPOON

What?


WILLA HARPER

The money, Icey.


ICEY SPOON

I declare, you'll let that money 

haunt you to your grave, Willa Harper!


WILLA HARPER

I would love to be satisfied Harry 

Powell don't think I've got that 

money somewhere.


ICEY SPOON

You'll come right out and ask that 

Man of God!

(turning and yelling)

Mr. Paow-well!

(to Willa)

Clear that evil mud out of your soul!


PREACHER starts towards her. ICEY pivots and we PAN OVER her 

to CHILDREN by river.


ICEY SPOON

(yelling)

John! Pearl!


CLOSE SHOT -- PEARL AND JOHN


JOHN looks up from pebble-skimming and loosens his tie.


ICEY SPOON

(yelling o.s.)

Come along hee-ere and get some fuu-

udge!


JOHN HARPER

(calling)

I don't want no fudge.


His brow is furrowed. He skims another pebble.


ICEY SPOON

(shouting o.s.)

You'll do what you're told!


They unwillingly get moving.


RESUME TWO-SHOT -- ICEY AND WILLA


ICEY SPOON

You go set down by the River.


WILLA HARPER

(getting up)

Oh, Icey, I'm a sight!


ICEY SPOON

Get along with you.


Both women set off, WILLA to River, ICEY towards GROUP. We 

TRACK after ICEY. PREACHER approaches. ICEY, crossing him, 

gives him a little shove towards WILLA and a coy --


ICEY SPOON

You!!!


We FOLLOW her to the women who are busying themselves with 

the fudge.


CLOSE GROUP SHOT -- ICEY AND WOMEN, FAVORING ICEY


...a few men in BACKGROUND, and, beyond them, PREACHER sits 

down by WILLA at water's edge. JOHN and PEARL approach. As 

ICEY starts yammering the men, WALT among them, shyly 

withdraw.


ICEY SPOON

That young lady'd better look sharp 

or some smart sister between here 

and Captina's a-gonna snap him up 

right from under her nose!

(they nod and agree, 

ad lib)

She's not the only fish in the river!

(more agreement. John 

and Pearl join Icey. 

Icey speaks to John)

Now you two stay put!


CLOSE SHOT -- JOHN


He looks hard towards WILLA and PREACHER o.s.


ICEY SPOON

(o.s., to women)

Shilly-shallying around...


LONG SHOT -- WILLA AND PREACHER


...from JOHN'S VIEWPOINT in tableau of decorous courtship, 

framed by heavy domestic bodies.


ICEY SPOON

(o.s.)

A husband's one piece of store goods 

ye never know till you get it home 

and take the paper off.


CLOSE TWO-SHOT -- WILLA AND PREACHER


They sit by the water; drooling willows; almost in travesty 

of a romantic scene. WILLA dabbles one hand in the water.


WILLA HARPER

(very shy)

Did Ben Harper ever tell you what he 

done with that money he stole?


HEAD CLOSE-UP -- PREACHER


His head goes slantwise and he smiles oddly.


PREACHER

My dear child, don't you know?


CLOSE SHOT -- JOHN


He watches intently towards his mother; PEARL holds his hand. 

ICEY'S voice o.s.


GROUP SHOT -- WOMEN, JOHN AND PEARL


ICEY SPOON

She's moonin' about Ben Harper. That 

wasn't love, it was just flapdoodle.

(agreeing nods and 

murmurs)

Have some fudge, lambs.

(she hands some down 

to John and Pearl. 

Pearl smears her 

mouth with it; John, 

watching always 

towards his mother, 

takes one nibble and 

throws the rest away)

When you're married forty years, you 

know all that don't amount to a hill 

o'beans! I been married to my Walt 

that long, and I'll swear in all 

that time I'd just lie there thinking 

about my canning.


In BACKGROUND WALT looks sheepish.


WILLA'S VOICE

(calling o.s.)

John! John?


All look towards her.


LONG SHOT -- OVER GROUP


WILLA is standing, beckoning JOHN


MEDIUM TWO-SHOT -- JOHN AND PEARL


They start towards their mother.


GROUP SHOT -- ICEY AND WOMEN -- NEW ANGLE


ICEY SPOON

A woman's a fool to marry for that. 

It's something for a man. The good 

Lord never meant for a decent woman 

to want that -- not really want it! 

It's all just a fake and a pipe-dream.


The others agree with her. She puts a piece of fudge in her 

mouth.


CLOSE GROUP SHOT -- PREACHER, WILLA, CHILDREN


...as JOHN and PEARL (with DOLL) come shyly up. WILLA is 

seated again. She is radiant.


WILLA HARPER

John, Mr. Powell has got something 

to tell you.


PREACHER

Well, John, the night before your 

father died, he told me what he did 

with that money.


CLOSE SHOT -- JOHN


He desperately conceals his reaction; he thinks BEN has 

betrayed him.


RESUME GROUP SHOT


PREACHER

That money's at the bottom of the 

river wrapped around a 12-pound 

cobblestone.


CLOSE SHOT -- JOHN AND PEARL


He now conceals his new reaction.


RESUME GROUP SHOT


WILLA touches PREACHER'S hand, warmly.


WILLA HARPER

Thank you, Harry.


She looks all around her, glowing, and stands up, hands to 

hair.


PEARL HARPER

John...


JOHN HARPER

Sshhh...


WILLA HARPER

I feel clean now! My whole body's 

just a quiverin' with cleanness!


She walks away towards ICEY and the WOMEN.


CLOSE SHOT -- PREACHER


PREACHER

John: here.


CLOSE SHOT -- JOHN AND PEARL


JOHN moves to stand in front of him; PEARL, to stand beside 

PREACHER, with the DOLL.


CLOSE SHOT -- PREACHER AND CHILDREN


From JOHN'S eye-level; as JOHN steps in front of him and 

PEARL beside him.


PREACHER

Your tie's crooked.


HEAD CLOSE-UP -- JOHN


The hand named LOVE and the hand named HATE come in to 

straighten the necktie. JOHN looks down. He looks up and 

sees:


GROUP SHOT -- JOHN'S VIEWPOINT


PREACHER, in close-up, hands busy o.s.; PEARL, with doll; 

and between them, in BACKGROUND, WILLA. She is now running 

fast towards ICEY, who walks towards her with arms 

outstretched. Behind them, the group of WOMEN. BIRDIE'S guitar 

music begins o.s.


DISSOLVE TO:


EXT. BIRDIE'S BOAT -- EVENING -- MEDIUM SHOT -- BIRDIE, JOHN 

AND SKIFF


Birdie sits beside his open door, strumming a guitar and 

singing. The scene is lamplighted from within. Ben's skiff 

is inverted on trestles in FOREGROUND. At start of scene we 

see only JOHN's feet; he's under the skiff, examining it. 

After three lines of song he comes out from under, and lounges 

against the skiff, tracing a tarry seam with his forefinger.


BIRDIE STEPTOE

(singing)

'Twas down at Cresap's Landing, Along 

the River Shore, Birdie Steptoe was 

a Pilot in the good old days of yore. 

Now he sets in his old wharf-boat...


JOHN HARPER

(across him)

When'll Dad's skiff be ready?


BIRDIE STEPTOE

Can't hear ye, boy.

(singing)

...So the big boats heave a sigh, 

They blow for Uncle Birdie...


JOHN HARPER

(across him)

When'll the skiff be ready?


BIRDIE STEPTOE

(singing)

And the times that are gone by. I'll 

have her ready inside of a week; and 

then we'll go fishin'. How's your 

Maw?


Through rest of scene, Birdie picks lazily at his guitar.


JOHN HARPER

O, she's all right.


BIRDIE STEPTOE

How's your sister Pearl?


JOHN HARPER

Just fine.


He gets up.


BIRDIE STEPTOE

Leavin', boy?


JOHN HARPER

Yep; gotta watch out for Pearl, Uncle 

Birdie.


BIRDIE STEPTOE

Well goodnight, boy. Come again -- 

any time.


JOHN leaves the SHOT.


BIRDIE STEPTOE

And mind now -- I'll have your Paw's 

skiff in ship-shape, 'side of a week.


MOVING SHOT -- JOHN


As he runs past SPOON'S, looking in, he is curious.


MOVING SHOT -- SPOON'S, HIS VIEWPOINT


ICEY embraces WILLA or waltzes her around; WALT looks on, 

pleased.


FULL SHOT -- JOHN


He hurries away from us towards home.


FRAMING SHOT -- THE HARPER HOUSE


In the otherwise dark house, one window is lighted. JOHN 

enters the SHOT, his back to us. Seeing the lighted window, 

he hesitates.


JOHN HARPER

(softly)

Is somebody there?


Silent pause, listening; then he walks cautiously towards 

us.


FULL SHOT -- JOHN


A tall, narrow shooting-frame; right and left thirds of screen 

are black.


We SHOOT from inside the screen door. JOHN crosses the porch 

and softly opens the door and enters on tiptoe and pauses, 

close to us, in the dark hallway, listening sharp.


JOHN HARPER

(softly)

Is anybody here?


Silence. Relieved, but puzzled, he tiptoes along towards the 

rear of the hallway in CLOSE-UP as we PULL AWAY. We bring in 

the bottom of the stairs.


PREACHER'S VOICE

(o.s.)

Good evening, John.


JOHN gasps, peering, and looks up.


TWO SHOT -- JOHN AND PREACHER -- NARROW SCREEN


PREACHER looks at JOHN; JOHN sinks onto the edge of a chair. 

PREACHER sits opposite. A bar of light from door falls across 

PREACHER'S face.


PREACHER

I had a little talk with your mother 

tonight, John; and your mother decided 

it might be best for me to -- let 

you know the news.


From JOHN, just a questioning helpless reaction.


PREACHER

Your mother told me tonight she wanted 

me to be a daddy to you and your 

sister. We're going to get married, 

son.


JOHN is still.


PREACHER

Did you hear what I said, son?


JOHN HARPER

Huh?


PREACHER

Married! We have decided to go to 

Sistersville tomorrow, and when we 

come back --


JOHN HARPER

(just breathing it)

You ain't my Dad! You won't never be 

my Dad!


PREACHER

(obsessed, disregarding 

him)

-- and when we come back, we'll all 

be friends -- and share our fortunes 

together, John!


JOHN HARPER

(screaming)

You think you can make me tell! But 

I won't! I won't! I won't!


He gawks at his own folly, covers his mouth with his hand 

and looks up at PREACHER.


PREACHER

(softly)

Tell me what, boy?


JOHN HARPER

Nothin'!


PREACHER

Are we keeping secrets from each 

other, little lad?


JOHN HARPER

No. No.


PREACHER


stiffens, relaxes, and chuckles softly.


PREACHER

No matter, boy, we've got a long 

time together.


CLOSE TWO-SHOT -- JOHN AND PREACHER


JOHN starts for the stairs.


DISSOLVE TO:


EXT. HARPER YARD -- MORNING -- CLOSE SHOT -- BEN'S FORD


It stands vibrating, then moves out of shot with receding 

engine sound o.s., disclosing:


TWO-SHOT -- JOHN AND PEARL


ICEY'S skirts in BACKGROUND. They are awfully spic-and-span; 

they even wear shoes.


ICEY SPOON

(o.s.)

Wave yer hands! Great sakes!


They wave after the car, bewilderedly.


ICEY SPOON

(o.s.)

You wait here while I get your night-

things.


She hustles out of shot.


PEARL HARPER

Now can I tell?


JOHN HARPER

Hm?


PEARL HARPER

When Mr. Powell's our Daddy then I 

can tell him about --


His hand clamps over her mouth. She struggles and whimpers.


JOHN HARPER

You swore, Pearl!


PEARL HARPER

(across him)

John! Don't!


JOHN HARPER

You promised Dad you wouldn't never 

tell!


He takes his hand away but holds it ready.


PEARL HARPER

I love Mr. Powell lots and lots, 

John.


JOHN grabs her by the shoulders and glares.


JOHN HARPER

Don't you tell! Don't you NEVER DARE 

tell!


Over them we


LAP DISSOLVE TO:


SHOULDER CLOSE-UP -- WILLA


She is caressing her shoulders.


FULL SHOT -- WILLA


Her back is to us. She is in a pathetic night dress; she 

stands before a mirror in a hotel bedroom in Sistersville. 

She walks to the door.


INSERT WILLA'S HAND


It hesitates on the doorknob.


CLOSE SHOT -- WILLA


Shooting OVER her as she opens the door, we see PREACHER in 

bed, his back to us. Beyond him, a window. The drawn shade 

rustles quietly.


CLOSE SHOT -- THE DOOR


...from within the room. WILLA closes the door, on which 

PREACHER'S coat hangs. The closing brings a knocking sound. 

WILLA feels the outside of the coat; feels something hard; 

takes out the knife and looks at it.


INSERT -- THE KNIFE IN HER HAND -- CLOSE SHOT -- WILLA


A moment of perplexity; then a little smile.


WILLA HARPER

(whispering)

Oh! It's... uh...


She puts it back in the pocket and gives the pocket a pat. 

She starts towards the bed.


TWO-SHOT -- WILLA AND PREACHER


We SHOOT OVER PREACHER as she approaches modestly and stands 

by the bed.


WILLA HARPER

(softly)

Harry...


His hand comes up; she puts out her own, expecting a loving 

hand-clasp; but PREACHER points to the window.


PREACHER

Fix that window shade.


Startled, then again tender, she moves to:


CLOSE SHOT -- WILLA AT WINDOW


She adjusts the shade, looking always towards the bed. She 

smiles maternally. As we PULL BACK and PAN into FULL SHOT OF 

BED she comes to the bed and sits on the edge and slips off 

her mules. PREACHER'S back is to her.


WILLA HARPER

(softly)

Harry!


PREACHER

(cool and clear)

I was praying.


WILLA HARPER

Oh, I'm sorry, Harry! I didn't know! 

I thought maybe --


With a sounding of bedsprings PREACHER turns. His voice is 

quiet and cold.


PREACHER

You thought, Willa, that the moment 

you walked in that door I'd start in 

to pawing you in the abominable way 

men are supposed to do on their 

wedding night. Ain't that right, 

now?


WILLA HARPER

No, Harry! I thought --


PREACHER

I think it's time we got one thing 

perfectly clear, Willa. Marriage to 

me represents a blending of two 

spirits in the sight of Heaven.


He gets out of bed. WILLA puts her face down to the pillow 

and moans.


PREACHER snaps on a harsh bare bulb at center of room.


PREACHER

(quietly)

Get up, Willa.


WILLA HARPER

Harry, what --


PREACHER

Get up.


She obeys.


PREACHER

Now go and look at yourself yonder 

in that mirror.


WILLA hesitates.


FULL SHOT -- OVER PREACHER -- CENTERING A STAINED BUREAU 

MIRROR


PREACHER

Do as I say.


WILLA walks to meet her image in the mirror; her eyes on 

PREACHER.


PREACHER

LOOK at yourself.


Her head drops, facing the mirror.


CLOSE SHOT -- WILLA, PREACHER, BULB


WILLA is in HEAD CLOSE-UP; bulb hangs at center; PREACHER, 

in his nightshirt, is beyond it.


PREACHER

What do you see, girl?


Her mouth trembles; she can't talk.


PREACHER

You see the body of a woman! The 

temple of creation and motherhood. 

You see the flesh of Eve that Man 

since Adam has profaned. That body 

was meant for begetting children. It 

was not meant for the lust of men.


WILLA just opens her mouth.


PREACHER

Do you want more children, Willa?


WILLA HARPER

I -- no, I --


PREACHER

It's the business of our marriage to 

mind those two you have now -- not 

to beget more.


WILLA HARPER

Yes.


He stands watching her for a moment; then he snaps off the 

light and gets into bed.


PREACHER

You can get back into bed now and 

stop shivering.


WILLA, in the darkness, does not move. She folds her hands 

in prayer and lifts her eyes.


WILLA HARPER

(whispering)

Help me to get clean so I can be 

what Harry wants me to be.

PEARL starts guiltily and looks towards him, scrambling money 

together. JOHN'S footsteps o.s.


PEARL HARPER

You'll get awful mad, John. I done a 

Sin!


CLOSE SHOT -- JOHN -- PEARL'S ANGLE


JOHN HARPER

You what?


He hears the frantic rustling of paper --


JOHN HARPER

(aghast)

Pearl! You ain't --


CLOSE SHOT -- PEARL, OVER JOHN


PEARL HARPER

John, don't be mad! Don't be mad! I 

was just playing with it! I didn't 

tell no one!


FLASH CUT CLOSE-UP -- JOHN


...as he stoops toward her, dumb with horror.


CLOSE SHOT -- PEARL


She continues to gather the money together.


PEARL HARPER

(pleading)

It's all here.


CLOSE TWO-SHOT -- JOHN AND PEARL


JOHN HARPER

Pearl! Oh, Pearl!


She's stuffing bills back into the torn doll. They slide 

through her fingers. He helps.


FLASH INSERT -- PREACHER'S FOOT


...as he plants it, with sound, in damp grass.


CLOSE SHOT -- THE CHILDREN


JOHN freezes.


PREACHER'S VOICE

(o.s.)

John?


JOHN HARPER

Oh -- yes?


LONG SHOT -- PREACHER -- CHILDREN'S VIEWPOINT


He stands at far end of arbor.


PREACHER

What are you doing, boy?


LONG SHOT -- CHILDREN -- PREACHER'S VIEWPOINT


JOHN HARPER

Getting Pearl to bed. I --


PREACHER

What's taking you so long about it?


FLASH INSERT -- THEIR FRANTIC HANDS, MONEY, THE DOLL


JOHN HARPER

(o.s.)

It -- she --


CLOSE SHOT -- PREACHER -- PEERING TOWARDS THEM


PREACHER

What's that you're playing with, 

boy?


LONG SHOT -- CHILDREN -- PREACHER'S VIEWPOINT


JOHN HARPER

Pearl's junk. Mom gets mad when she 

plays out here and don't clean up 

afterward.


PREACHER

Come on, children!


INSERT -- JOHN'S HANDS PIN THE DOLL TOGETHER


FULL SHOT -- CHILDREN STAND UP, LOOK TOWARDS PREACHER, AND 

SLOWLY START TOWARDS HIM. THE TWO FORGOTTEN PAPER-DOLLS ARE 

BLOWN TOWARDS HIM TOO.


MOVING SHOT -- PREACHER -- JOHN'S VIEWPOINT


PREACHER'S watch-chain gleams. The shot SLOWLY CLOSES DOWN 

on it and becomes still. We see the paper-dolls blow past 

him.


PREACHER'S VOICE

Now, up to bed with the both of you.


CLOSE SHOT -- JOHN AND PEARL


JOHN starts to laugh uncontrollably. We PAN them past 

PREACHER'S stomach into FULL SHOT.


PREACHER'S VOICE

Come here, John. Run along, Pearl.


PEARL goes, JOHN comes towards PREACHER.


PREACHER -- JOHN'S VIEWPOINT


PREACHER

Your mother says you tattled on me, 

boy. She says you told her that I 

asked you where that money was hid.


JOHN HARPER

(o.s.)

Yes. Yes.


PREACHER

That wasn't very nice of you, John. 

Have a heart, boy.


CLOSE SHOT -- JOHN


His helpless reaction. Pause.


PREACHER'S VOICE

Run along to bed.


As JOHN turns away we


LAP DISSOLVE TO:


CLOSE SHOT -- WILLA IN PROFILE


...and PULL AWAY showing JOHN as he turns to her. (PEARL'S 

head is turned away; she's asleep.)


WILLA HARPER

Were you impudent to Mr. Powell, 

John?


JOHN HARPER

Mom, I didn't mean --


WILLA HARPER

What were you impudent about?


JOHN HARPER

He asked me about the money again, 

Mom.


WILLA HARPER

You always make up that lie, John! 

There is no money, John. Can't you 

get that through your head?


LAP DISSOLVE TO:


CLOSE SHOT -- A GAR, UNDERWATER CLOSE UPWARD TWO-SHOT -- 

JOHN AND BIRDIE


They look down into the water.


BIRDIE STEPTOE

Meanest, orneriest, sneakinest critter 

in the whole river, boy! A gar!


CLOSE TWO-SHOT -- JOHN AND BIRDIE


They sit up into it.


JOHN HARPER

Here's your can o' hooks, Uncle 

Birdie.


BIRDIE STEPTOE

There hain't nary hook in the land 

smart enough to hook Mister Gar. 

What a feller needs is mother-wit -- 

and a horse-hair.


Over this, he pulls horse-hair out of his hatband. He sets 

to work rigging his noose.


JOHN HARPER

Won't he bust it, Uncle Birdie?


BIRDIE STEPTOE

Shoot, a horse-hair'll hold a lumpin' 

whale.


He puts over his line. Pause.


BIRDIE STEPTOE

Do you mind me cussin', boy?


JOHN HARPER

No.


BIRDIE STEPTOE

Tell you why I ask -- your step-pa 

being' a Preacher an' all...


JOHN's lips go like string. BIRDIE sees it.


BIRDIE STEPTOE

Never was much of a one for preachers 

myself. I dunno what's wrong up at 

your place, but just remember one 

thing, Cap -- if ever you need help 

you just holler out and come a-

runnin'. Old Uncle Birdie's your 

friend.


A powerful strike. BIRDIE lands the gar. The air is full of 

sparkling water.


BIRDIE STEPTOE

There! You slimy, snag-toothed, egg-

suckin', bait-stealin' so-and-so!


QUICK INSERT -- THE THUMPING FISH IN BOTTOM OF BOAT


FULL SHOT


He beats the fish with the heel of an old shoe.


BIRDIE STEPTOE

(beating)

Mind what I told you. If ever you 

get in a crack, I just come a-runnin'.


Now there is no sound of thumping or beating.


CLOSE SHOT -- JOHN


Admiring BIRDIE, he squares his shoulders, full of confidence.


JOHN HARPER

Can we eat him, Uncle Birdie?


BIRDIE STEPTOE

If you got an appetite for bones and 

bitterness.


On this, he flings the dead gar in a wide arc out into the 

river.


LAP DISSOLVE TO:


INT. CHILDREN'S BEDROOM -- NIGHT


The children are ready for bed.


CLOSE SHOT -- PREACHER


Smiling, quiet, awaiting an answer.


CLOSE SHOT -- JOHN


JOHN HARPER

I don't know.


TWO-SHOT -- JOHN AND PREACHER


PEARL plays unconcernedly in background.


PREACHER

(intimately)

She thinks that money's in the river, 

but you and me, we know better, don't 

we, boy?


JOHN HARPER

I don't know nothin'!


PREACHER

The summer is young yet, little lad.

(he turns away from 

John)

Pearl?


He holds out his hands to her; she comes to his lap, dropping 

her doll at his feet. JOHN turns his back and looks out the 

window beside bureau.


PREACHER

John's a feller who likes to keep 

secrets.


PEARL HARPER

Mm-hm.


PREACHER

I'll tell you a secret.


PEARL HARPER

Yes?


PREACHER

I knowed your Daddy.

(PEARL frowns)

And do you know what your Daddy said 

to me? He said, "Tell my little girl 

Pearl there's to be no secrets between 

her and you."


INSERT -- JOHN'S HAND COMES TO REST BESIDE A HAIRBRUSH


RESUME TWO-SHOT -- PREACHER AND PEARL, JOHN IN B.G.


PEARL HARPER

Yes?


PREACHER

Now it's your turn.


PEARL HARPER

What secret shall I tell?


PREACHER

How old are you?


PEARL HARPER

That's no secret. I'm five.


CLOSE SHOT -- JOHN -- PREACHER AND PEARL IN B.G.


A look of impotent hatred.


PREACHER

Sure, that's no secret.


RESUME TWO-SHOT


PREACHER

(continuing)

What's your name?


PEARL HARPER

(giggling)

You're just foolin'! My name's Pearl.


PREACHER

Tst-tst! Then I reckon I'll have to 

try again! Where's the money hid?


JOHN throws the hairbrush, striking PREACHER's head.


JOHN HARPER

(screaming as he throws)

You swore you wouldn't tell!

(he beats the air 

with his fists)

You swore! You swore! You swore!


CLOSE SHOT -- PREACHER


He is sure now PEARL knows.


THREE-SHOT -- PEARL, PREACHER, JOHN


PEARL HARPER

(awed)

You hit Daddy with the hairbrush!


Another silence.


PREACHER

(cheerfully)

You see? We can't have anything to 

do with John.

(light off)

You and me will go down to the parlor.


PEARL HARPER

Miz Jenny! Miz Jenny!


She gets the doll. We PAN them through the door.


TWO-SHOT -- PREACHER AND PEARL


Outside door as he closes it.


PREACHER

John's just plumb bad through and 

through --


CLOSE SHOT -- PEARL


As PREACHER's hand locks the door.


PEARL HARPER

(at door)

Yes, John's just plumb bad.


CUT TO:


INT. SPOON'S ICE CREAM PARLOR -- THREE-SHOT -- WILLA, ICEY, 

WALT


We shoot over ICEY as WILLA opens the door to leave. WILLA 

is in outdoor clothes and is not dressed for work in the 

parlor.


WILLA HARPER

That boy's as stubborn and mulish as 

a sheep!


ICEY SPOON

It's a shame!


WILLA's face shines like one possessed.


WILLA HARPER

Goodnight.


WALT enters shot, his back to us.


ICEY SPOON

Goodnight, honey.


As WILLA starts away we DOLLY THROUGH DOOR and PAN her to 

deserted street. There is a river mist.


TWO-SHOT -- WALT AND ICEY


WALT is ill at ease.


RESUME SHOT ON WILLA


ICEY SPOON

(o.s. calling)

Plan on a longer visit next time.


WALT

(o.s.)

You don't hardly get settled till 

you're frettin' to git home again.


Again WILLA pauses and turns.


WILLA HARPER

(with sweet radiance. 

To Walt)

I'm needed to keep peace and harmony 

between them.

(to Icey)

It's my burden and I'm proud of it, 

Icey!


She walks off into the mist.


LAP DISSOLVE TO:


EXT. HARPER HOME -- NIGHT -- MEDIUM SHOT -- LIGHTED PARLOR 

WINDOW; REST OF HOUSE DARK


Distant muffled sound of river-boat whistle.


PEARL HARPER

(o.s.)

John's bad.


WILLA enters, her back to us; she stops.


PREACHER

(o.s.)

Yes; John's bad.


PEARL HARPER

Tell me another secret about my Dad.


CLOSE SHOT -- WILLA


She smiles benignly.


PREACHER

(o.s.)

O no! Your turn!


PEARL HARPER

All right.


PREACHER

Where's the money hid.


WILLA keeps smiling.


PEARL HARPER

John's bad.


PREACHER

Where's the money hid? Tell me, you 

little wretch, or I'll tear your arm 

off!


Still smiling, shaking her head as in disbelief, WILLA makes 

for house as PEARL screams.


INT. HARPER HALLWAY -- TWO-SHOT -- WILLA AND PREACHER


Narrow screen, same set-up as in earlier corridor scene, 

PREACHER and WILLA. Their eyes meet. Pause.


PREACHER

(stunned)

I didn't expect you home so soon.


CLOSE SHOT -- WILLA


She still smiles; her eyes turn to sound of PEARL's sobbing.


TWO SHOT -- AS BEFORE


PREACHER stands still; WILLA in BACKGROUND opens closet door 

where PEARL sobs.


CUT TO:


TWO-SHOT -- WALT AND ICEY


...washing and drying glasses. ICEY is washing briskly, WALT 

is drying slowly.


WALT

Icey, I'm worried about Willa.


ICEY SPOON

How do you mean?


WALT

I'm figurin' how I can say it so's 

you won't get mad.


ICEY SPOON

Say what, Walt Spoon!


WALT

There's somethin' wrong about it, 

Mother.


ICEY SPOON

About what!


WALT

About Mr. Powell. All of it!


ICEY SPOON

Walt!


WALT

Now, Mother, a body can't help their 

feelin's.


ICEY SPOON

May the Lord have mercy on you, Walt 

Spoon!


WALT

Mother, I only --


CUT TO:


INT. WILLA'S AND PREACHER'S BEDROOM -- FULL SHOT -- WILLA ON 

BED -- PREACHER IN BACKGROUND


WILLA lies in profile on the bed along the bottom of the 

frame. A prim, old woman's nightdress makes her look like a 

child. Her hands are clasped.


PREACHER, fully dressed, stands at the window, which is in 

BACKGROUND towards foot of bed. His coat, hung over a chair, 

is in silhouette. River mist outside window halated by 

exterior gas-lamp. The window shade is up. She is mumbling 

in prayer. She stops.


PREACHER

(his back still turned)

Are you through praying?


WILLA HARPER

I'm through, Harry.


He turns. WILLA is calm and immobile with the ecstasy of a 

martyr.


PREACHER

You were listening outside the parlor 

window.


WILLA HARPER

It's not in the river, is it Harry?


PREACHER

Answer me!


WILLA HARPER

Ben never told you he throwed it in 

the river? Did he?


PREACHER hits her across the mouth. A pause.


WILLA HARPER

(continues, unruffled)

Then the children know where it is 

hid? John knows? Is that it?

(a pause)

Then it's still here, somewhere 

amongst us, tainting us?


CLOSE SHOT -- PREACHER, LISTENING FOR A VOICE


RESUME TWO-SHOT


WILLA HARPER

So you must have known it all along, 

Harry.


CLOSE SHOT -- PREACHER, LISTENING


After a moment, the river boat whistle blows, nearer. HOLD 

CLOSE-UP a moment after whistle.


CLOSE DOWN-SHOT -- WILLA, SAINT-LIKE


WILLA HARPER

But that ain't why you married me, 

Harry. I know that much. It couldn't 

be that because the Lord just wouldn't 

let it.


RESUME TWO-SHOT -- WILLA


WILLA HARPER

He made you marry me so's you could 

show me the Way and the Life and the 

Salvation of my soul! Ain't that so, 

Harry?


CLOSE SHOT -- PREACHER


He has heard the VOICE and starts to move out of CLOSE SHOT.


RESUME TWO-SHOT


He has moved over to the coat on back of chair.


CLOSE SHOT -- COAT


His hand goes into the pocket and brings the knife out. (It 

is the same coat, and pocket, as in the wedding-night scene.)


RESUME TWO-SHOT


WILLA HARPER

So you might say it was the money 

that brung us together.


He pulls down the blind. He moves toward the bed.


WILLA HARPER

The rest of it don't matter, Harry.

RESUME TWO-SHOT


As he raises his arm to strike:


HEAD CLOSE-UP -- WILLA


WILLA HARPER

Bless us all!


DISSOLVE TO:


INT. CHILDREN'S BEDROOM -- FULL SHOT -- THE SHADOWS ON THE 

WALL


They are shaped as in earlier scene, but altered by mist. 

Set-up as in earlier scene. Over them we hear the whinny-and-

catch and the failure of the Ford being cranked; once; then 

again: the JOHN's shadow moves on the wall and on a third 

cranking which engages the engine, we PAN TO WINDOW, shooting 

over JOHN, who peers out, into blind mist. The gears of the 

car shift; the car moves away, unseen; its sounds diminish 

slowly, and die. A moment of silence; then JOHN turns and we 

PAN him to the bed. He gets in beside PEARL, who is asleep, 

and, as we TIGHTEN IN CLOSE, puts his hand across the face 

of the doll.


DISSOLVE TO:


HEAD CLOSE-UP -- ICEY


An ominous expression. She looks sharp to WALT, beckoning 

secretly; through rear screen door of kitchen, onto porch.


ICEY SPOON

(loud whisper)

Walt! Come quick!


FULL FIGURE SHOT -- WALT


He is scrubbing out an ice cream container on the back porch. 

He looks up and moves towards her.


WALT

(natural voice)

What's wrong, Mother?


MEDIUM CLOSE -- ICEY, THEN WALT


ICEY SPOON

(whisper)

Sshhh! He's in there.


WALT ENTERS SHOT with pipe.


WALT

Who?


ICEY SPOON

(whisper)

Mr. Powell!

(Walt looks enquiry)

Willa has run away!


WALT

I'll be switched!...


They enter the kitchen. We hear muffled sounds of sobbing 

o.s.


MEDIUM CLOSE TWO-SHOT


WALT

Just went?


ICEY SPOON

She took out some time durin' the 

night, -- in that old Model-T --


WALT clucks his tongue.


WALT

Is he hit pretty bad?


ICEY SPOON

All to pieces!


WALT moves towards kitchen cabinet.


WALT

There's a little peach brandy -- 

maybe a sip?


ICEY SPOON

A man of the Cloth?


MEDIUM CLOSE SHOT -- WALT


He pours, snaps it down; weak-defiance.


MEDIUM CLOSE SHOT -- ICEY


ICEY SPOON

Walt Spoon, that's for sickness in 

the house!


MEDIUM CLOSE SHOT -- WALT


He looks towards o.s. sobbing.


WALT

What can we do, Mother?


TWO-SHOT


ICEY SPOON

I thought if you went and talked to 

him -- another man --


MEDIUM SHOT -- PREACHER


He sits at a table, his back towards us, mumbling over his 

Bible.


TWO-SHOT -- WALT, ICEY BEHIND HIM, ENTERING THROUGH DOOR


WALT

Mister Powell?


PREACHER

(suddenly loud)

A strange woman is a narrow pit!


ICEY SPOON

(a reverent whisper)

Amen! Amen!


PREACHER

She lieth in wait as for a prey. And 

increaseth the transgressors among 

men.


He closes his Bible and turns to them with weepy eyes and a 

brave little smile.


PREACHER

My dear, dear friends! Whatever would 

I do without you!


CLOSE SHOT -- ICEY


ICEY SPOON

(wailing)

Mister Powell!


THREE-SHOT -- NEW ANGLE


WALT

Is there anythin' -- anythin'...?


PREACHER

It is my shame -- my crown of thorns. 

And I must wear it bravely.


ICEY SPOON

What could have possessed that girl!


PREACHER

(simply)

Satan.


ICEY SPOON

Ah.


WALT sits across from PREACHER. ICEY is at PREACHER's elbow.


WALT

Didn't you have no inkling?


PREACHER

Yes; from the first night.


WALT

The first night?


PREACHER

Our honeymoon.


CLOSE SHOT -- WALT


WALT

How's that?


TWO-SHOT -- PREACHER AND ICEY


PREACHER

She turned me out of the bed.


ICEY SPOON

(with pleasure)

Nnnoooo!!


CLOSE SHOT -- WALT


Filling his pipe.


WALT

What do you figure to do?


TWO-SHOT -- PREACHER AND ICEY


PREACHER

Do? Why stay and take care of them 

little kids. Maybe it was never meant 

for a woman like Willa to taint their 

young lives.


ICEY SPOON

(hands clasped; with 

approval)

Mmmmm!


CLOSE SHOT -- WALT


Dabbing at moisture in the corner of his eye.


WALT

That's mighty brave of you, Reverend.


TWO-SHOT -- PREACHER AND ICEY


PREACHER

I reckon it's been ordained this 

way, Brother Spoon.


CLOSE SHOT -- WALT


WALT

Didn't -- didn't she leave no word?


TWO-SHOT -- PREACHER AND ICEY


PREACHER

A scrawl. On a piece of notepaper on 

the bureau.


ICEY smiles sideways.


PREACHER

I burned it.

(Preacher holds out 

his hand, stares in 

disgust, and wipes 

his palm dramatically 

on his coatsleeve)

I tore it up and burned it -- it 

stank so strong of hellfire.


ICEY SPOON

Amen.


PREACHER

The pitcher has went to the well 

once too often, my friends.


CLOSE SHOT -- WALT


WALT

She'll come draggin' her tail back 

home.


CLOSE SHOT -- PREACHER


PREACHER

She'll not be back. I reckon I'd be 

safe in promisin' you that.


CLOSE SHOT -- WALT


WALT

Maybe she's just run off on a spree.


PREACHER'S VOICE

(o.s.)

No!


WALT

Well, there's no harm in hopin'.


TWO-SHOT -- PREACHER AND ICEY


PREACHER

Ain't no sense in it, neither. I 

figured somethin' like this was 

brewin' when she went to bed last 

night.


ICEY SPOON

(all woman)

How?


PREACHER

She tarried around the kitchen after 

I'd gone up, and when I went 

downstairs to see what was wrong...


ICEY SPOON

(eagerly)

What!


PREACHER

She'd found this fruit jar of 

dandelion wine

(Icey touches him)

that the husband -- Harper -- had 

hid somewheres in the cellar.

(playing his ace)

She was drinking.


CLOSE SHOT -- ICEY


ICEY is happy to let her mouth fall open and let out a gasp.


CLOSE SHOT -- WALT


Sniffling.


THREE-SHOT -- PREACHER, ICEY, WALT


PREACHER

I tried to save her.


ICEY SPOON

I know you did, Reverend. Oh, I know 

how you tried!


PREACHER

The devil wins sometimes!

PREACHER

(eyes upturned)

Can't nobody say I didn't do my best 

to save her!


DISSOLVE TO:


CLOSE UNDERWATER SHOT (TANK)


We PAN, with slowly streaming weeds, and bring in WILLA in 

close profile; the current, coming from behind her, drifts 

her long hair across her throat.


MEDIUM SHOT -- WILLA AND CAR


She is in profile as before --


CLOSE SHOT -- A BAITED HOOK


It descends, and catches on the windshield, and the line 

tautens; then tugs. We start to follow the line up.


CLOSE SHOT -- ABOVE WATER -- THE LINE


We continue to follow the line up, and bring in, close, the 

stern of BEN HARPER's skiff.


MEDIUM SHOT -- UNCLE BIRDIE


He sits back, tugging unconcernedly at the line. Then he 

leans over to see what's wrong.


CLOSE SHOT -- BIRDIE


...as he peers over side.


DOWNSHOT -- FULL SHOT OF CAR AND WILLA; BIRDIE'S VIEWPOINT


CLOSE SHOT -- BIRDIE, HORROR-STRICKEN MOVING UNDERWATER SHOT -- 

WILLA


We hear PREACHER's voice o.s., singing:


PREACHER

(o.s.)

Leaning! Leaning! Safe and secure 

from all alarms!


Meanwhile we move vertically DOWNWARD TOWARDS HER FACE, serene 

in death. We may or may not glimpse the gashed throat, through 

drifting hair.


LAP DISSOLVE TO:


EXT. HARPER HOME -- FULL SHOT -- THE HOUSE AND TREE


PREACHER leans against the tree; he continues singing:


PREACHER

Leaning! Leaning! Leaning on the 

Everlasting Arms!

(seductively)

Children!


CLOSE MOVING SHOT -- PREACHER


We start moving before he does. LOW CAMERA; full figure. We 

TILT to frame him from the waist downward and follow close 

behind him. As he leaves the tree and walks along the side 

of the house; we TILT DOWNWARD and CLOSE IN, to follow only 

his feet; he steps past a tiny cellar window and we PAN and 

TIGHTEN IN CLOSE ON IT, into --


CLOSE TWO-SHOT -- JOHN AND PEARL


Their noses are flat against the glass; their cheeks touch; 

their window isn't quite big enough to hold both their heads. 

It is on the ground; we don't see their chins. They look 

towards the departed PREACHER.


PREACHER'S VOICE

(o.s.)

Chill-dren?


PEARL, who is on the side PREACHER has left by, turns her 

head towards JOHN.


INT. CELLAR -- MEDIUM CLOSE TWO-SHOT -- JOHN AND PEARL


They are standing on a coal heap, faces at window.


PEARL HARPER

John, why do we have to hide?


JOHN has taken charge. He speaks very quietly, but calmly 

and cheerfully, as to an invalid. He starts down the rustling 

coal-heap, helping PEARL down.


JOHN HARPER

Careful...


The following dialogue as they climb down, making as little 

noise as possible.


We PULL slowly away.


PEARL HARPER

Where's Mom?


JOHN HARPER

She's gone to Moundsville.


PEARL HARPER

To see Dad?


JOHN HARPER

Yes, I reckon that's it.


They have achieved the cellar floor.


PREACHER'S VOICE

(more peremptorily 

outside)

Children!


During the following dialogue we hear, o.s., the opening of 

a door, and PREACHER'S footsteps indoors as he crosses floor, 

climbs stairs, and opens another door.


JOHN HARPER

Someone is after us, Pearl.


PEARL HARPER

I want to go upstairs. It's cold and 

spidery down here. I'm hungry.


JOHN HARPER

Now listen to me, Pearl. You and me 

is runnin' off tonight.


PEARL HARPER

Why?


JOHN HARPER

If we stay here somethin' awful will 

happen to us.


PEARL HARPER

Won't Daddy Powell take care of us?


JOHN HARPER

No, that's just it. No.


FULL SHOT -- A ROOM UPSTAIRS


PREACHER looks under the bed.


RESUME CELLAR TWO-SHOT -- THE CHILDREN


PEARL HARPER

Where are we goin', John?


JOHN HARPER

Somewheres. I don't know yet.


o.s., PREACHER'S footsteps come down stairs; JOHN leads PEARL 

carefully past a rake, a hoe, and a shelf-prop and they crouch 

down into --


CLOSE TWO-SHOT -- JOHN AND PEARL


...beside an apple barrel. PREACHER'S footsteps cross kitchen 

o.s.


PEARL HARPER

I'm hungry, John.


JOHN HARPER

We'll steal somethin' to eat.


PEARL HARPER

It'll spoil our supper.


PREACHER'S VOICE

(o.s.)

Pearl?


Both look sharp towards cellar door o.s.


THE CELLAR DOOR -- CHILDREN'S VIEWPOINT


The door opens; PREACHER'S head, carrying a candle in holder; 

a white-washed wall and stairs are lighted.


PREACHER'S VOICE

I hear you whisperin', children, so 

I know you're down there. I can feel 

myself gettin' awful mad, children.


CLOSE TWO-SHOT -- THE CHILDREN


PEARL HARPER

(whispering)

John...


JOHN claps his hand over her mouth.


CELLAR DOOR


PREACHER'S VOICE

My patience has run out, children. 

I'm comin' to find you now.


He clop-clops nearly to the bottom of the stairs. ICEY'S 

voice cuts cheerfully across his descent.


ICEY SPOON

(calling o.s.)

Yoo-Hooooo! Mis-ter Paow-welll!


He goes up the stairs and vanishes. Light on wall through 

open door to kitchen.


ICEY'S VOICE

Just a little hot supper I fixed for 

you and the children.


PREACHER'S VOICE

Bless you, bless you!


ICEY'S VOICE

And how are the children?


PREACHER'S VOICE

They're down there playin' games in 

the cellar and they won't mind me 

when I call 'em. I'm at my wit's 

end, Miz Spoon.


ICEY clucks her tongue o.s.


ICEY'S VOICE

She appears at head of stairs. Her voice crackles with 

authority.

John! Pearl! Shake a leg!

sharply)


FULL SHOT -- THE KITCHEN -- OVER ICEY


ICEY SPOON

(continuing)

I won't have you worryin' poor Mister 

Powell another minute!


A short pause; then the children, covered with coal-dust, 

emerge into the light and climb the stairs. JOHN'S head is 

hung in defeat. As they enter the kitchen we PULL BACK.


ICEY SPOON

Just look at you! Dust and filth 

from top to toe!


GROUP SHOT -- THE CHILDREN, OVER PREACHER AND ICEY


ICEY SPOON

Want me to take 'em up and wash 'em

Thank you, no. Thank you, dear Icey. 

I'll tend to them. Thank you.


ICEY pats JOHN'S head.


CLOSE SHOT -- JOHN


ICEY'S VOICE

Don't be too hard on 'em, Reverend. 

Poor motherless children.


JOHN looks to PEARL and we PAN HER IN as PREACHER'S hand

ICEY as they move towards the door.

ICEY goes away along path outside. PREACHER, his back to us, 

watches her a moment, then turns.


PREACHER

Weren't you afraid, my little lambs, 

down there in all that dark?


HEAD CLOSE-UP -- JOHN


Wondering what to do next.


LAP DISSOLVE TO:


CLOSE SHOT -- BIRDIE, OVER BESS'S PICTURE


We begin with HEAD CLOSE-UP of BIRDIE as he rocks, and PULL 

BACK He is rocking; and drunk. A bottle stands beside the 

picture. He turns and speaks to the picture.


BIRDIE STEPTOE

They'll think it was me! They'll 

think it was old Uncle Birdie!


CLOSE SHOT -- BIRDIE -- NEW ANGLE


His hands grip the edge of the chest on either side of the 

picture, which we now see.


BIRDIE STEPTOE

If you'd o' seen it, Bess! I'm drunk 

as a lord and I know it, but...


INSERT -- BESS'S PICTURE


BIRDIE'S VOICE

(o.s. continuing)

Sweet Heaven, if you'd o' seen it!


RESUME PREVIOUS SHOT


BIRDIE picks up the bottle. His hand and the liquor tremble.


BIRDIE STEPTOE

(continuing)

Down there in the deep place... her 

hair wavin' lazy and soft like meadow 

grass under flood waters and that 

slit in her throat just like she had 

an extry mouth.


INSERT BESS'S PICTURE


BIRDIE'S VOICE

(o.s.)

And there ain't mortal human I can 

tell but you...


RESUME PREVIOUS SHOT


BIRDIE STEPTOE

(continuing)

...Bess, for if I go to the Law 

they'll hang it on to me.


The bottle falls from his hand onto its side on the edge of 

the chest.


CLOSE SHOT -- BIRDIE -- NEW ANGLE


The reverse angle of the opening shot. BIRDIE rocks heavily; 

liquor gurgles from bottle to floor.


BIRDIE STEPTOE

Sweet Heaven save poor old Uncle 

Birdie!


LAP DISSOLVE TO:


MEDIUM THREE-SHOT -- PREACHER, JOHN, PEARL


PREACHER sits at head of table. JOHN stands to PREACHER'S 

right, around corner of table; he remains expressionless and 

immobile, until he speaks. PEARL stands to JOHN'S right, 

hugging the DOLL. The table is loaded with good food.


PREACHER, well-fed and at leisure, dabs his mouth delicately 

with his napkin, folds it, puts it in a ring, and folds his 

hands. He waits.


PEARL HARPER

(at last)

I'm hungry.


PREACHER

Why, sure. And there's fried chicken 

and candied sweets and cornsticks 

and apple cobbler!


PEARL HARPER

Can I have my supper please?


PREACHER

Naturally.


PEARL HARPER

Can I have milk too?


PREACHER

Yes. But first of all we'll have a 

little talk.


PEARL frowns and puts her finger in her mouth; she remembers 

he twisted her arm.


PREACHER

(softly)

About our secrets.


PEARL HARPER

No.


PREACHER

Why, pray tell?


PEARL HARPER

Because John said I mustn't.


THREE-SHOT REVERSE -- PREACHER, OVER NECKS OF CHILDREN


He slaps the table; his eyes crackle.


PREACHER

NEVER -- MIND -- WHAT -- JOHN -- 

SAID!


PEARL starts to snivel.


PREACHER

John is a meddler. Stop sniveling. 

Looky here a minute!


He brings out the knife.


PREACHER

Know what this is?


PEARL shakes her head for no.


PREACHER

Want to see something cute? Looky 

now!


He touches the spring; the blade flicks open.


PREACHER

How about that! This is what I use 

on meddlers.


He lays the open knife on the table.


PREACHER

John might be a meddler.


THREE-SHOT -- THE CHILDREN, OVER PREACHER


PEARL thinks the knife is a toy and crosses behind JOHN to 

pick it up.


PREACHER

NO -- no, my lamb. Don't touch it! 

Now don't touch my knife! That makes 

me mad. Very, very mad.


She hugs the DOLL and he puts the hand named LOVE on her 

curls.


PREACHER

Just tell me now; where's the money 

hid?


PEARL HARPER

(affectionately)

But I swore. I promised John I 

wouldn't tell.


CLOSE SHOT -- PREACHER


PREACHER

JOHN -- DOESN'T -- MATTER! Can't I 

get that through your head, you poor, 

silly, disgusting little wretch!


HEAD CLOSE-UP -- PEARL


Her mouth quivers; a large tear brims in her eyes.


CLOSE SHOT -- PREACHER


PREACHER

There now! You made me lose my temper!


THREE-SHOT -- CHILDREN, OVER PREACHER


PREACHER

I'm sorry! I'm real sorry!


PEARL sniffles and wipes her eyes with her free fist.


PREACHER

(in a caressing tone)

Now! Where's it hid, honey?


JOHN HARPER

(suddenly and lightly)

I'll tell.


THREE-SHOT -- PREACHER, OVER NAPES OF CHILDREN


PREACHER

(lightly)

I thought I told you to keep your 

mouth shut --


JOHN HARPER

(light and quick)

NO, -- it ain't fair to make Pearl 

tell when she swore she wouldn't. 

I'll tell.


PREACHER'S EYES CRINKLE and he turns to PEARL, smiling 

brightly.


PREACHER

(chuckling)

Well I declare! Sometimes I think 

poor John will make it to heaven 

yet!


His eyes snap back to JOHN and his voice is like a whip.


PREACHER

All right boy: where's the money?


HEAD CLOSE-UP -- JOHN


JOHN HARPER

In the cellar. Buried under a stone 

in the floor.


THREE-SHOT -- PREACHER OVER CHILDREN


He closes and pockets the knife. His eyes never leave JOHN'S.


PREACHER

It'll go hard, boy, if I find you're 

lyin'.


THREE-SHOT -- PREACHER OVER CHILDREN


PEARL gapes up at JOHN as he speaks.


JOHN HARPER

I ain't lyin'. Go look for yourself.


CLOSE SHOT -- PREACHER


...as he gets up, cellar door in BACKGROUND.


PREACHER

All right...

(he turns towards the 

door; then glances 

around)

Come along.


HEAD CLOSE-UP -- JOHN


JOHN HARPER

What?


THREE-SHOT -- PREACHER, OVER CHILDREN


PREACHER

Go ahead of me -- the both of you.


They cross him, towards the door.


FULL SHOT -- THE CELLAR STEPS -- FROM THE BOTTOM


The CHILDREN precede PREACHER, who carries a candle in holder. 

PEARL is gaping at JOHN'S lie. JOHN is looking left and right, 

casing the joint.


PREACHER

(continuing)

You don't reckon I'd leave you.


JOHN HARPER

(with forced lightness)

Don't you believe me?


PREACHER

(sardonically)

Why sure, boy, sure.


Now they are at bottom of stairs. JOHN sees PEARL'S expression 

and takes her hand.


PREACHER

Now where, boy? Mind; no tricks. I 

can't abide liars.


JOHN HARPER

Yonder.


He squeezes PEARL'S hand harder, and points.


FULL SHOT -- NEW ANGLE -- OVER THE THREE


JOHN points out a place beneath a shelf laden with Mason 

jars; it is at the most distant part of the cellar from the 

stairs.


PREACHER starts toward it, leaving them at foot of stairs, 

then turns, catching JOHN'S ruse.


PREACHER

(sardonic)

O no you don't!


He shepherds them ahead of him.


THREE-SHOT -- NEW ANGLE


They arrive beneath the shelf.


PREACHER

Now: Where?


JOHN HARPER

(lying magnificently, 

meeting Preacher's 

eyes)

Under the stone in the floor.


PREACHER sets the candle on a barrel near the shelf-prop and 

sinks to his knees below shot as PEARL gapes at JOHN and 

JOHN looks stony. She seems about to speak.


FLASH INSERT -- JOHN SQUEEZES PEARL'S HAND HARD CLOSE SHOT -- 

PREACHER, FEATURING FLOOR


His hands sweep dust and expose concrete. He straightens on 

his knees and turns to the children in close BACKGROUND.


HEAD CLOSE-UP -- PREACHER


...as he turns.


PREACHER

This is concrete.


CLOSE TWO-SHOT -- THE CHILDREN


A moment's silence.


PEARL HARPER

John made a Sin. John told a lie.


THREE-SHOT -- FAVORING PREACHER


PREACHER gets slowly to his feet and puts on his "listening" 

look. His sincerity is beyond doubt.


PREACHER

The Lord's a-talkin' to me now. He's 

a-sayin', "a liar is an abomination 

before mine eyes."


He takes his knife out, and springs it open.


CLOSE TWO-SHOT -- FAVORING JOHN


PREACHER

Speak, boy: Where's it hid?

(the knife pricks the 

flesh under John's 

ear)

Speak; before I cut your throat and 

leave you to drip like a hog hung up 

in butcherin' time!


CLOSE SHOT -- PEARL


She starts to sob.


CLOSE TWO-SHOT -- JOHN AND PREACHER


JOHN HARPER

Pearl, shut up! Pearl, you swore!


PREACHER

You could save him, little bird.


HEAD CLOSE-UP -- PEARL


PEARL HARPER

(crying)

Inside my doll! Inside my doll!


TWO-SHOT -- JOHN AND PREACHER, FAVORING PREACHER


PREACHER is astounded. His hands fall away from JOHN. He 

leans back against the wall and talks through laughter.


PREACHER

In the doll! Why sure! Sure!


HEAD CLOSE-UP -- JOHN


His eyes are all over the place.


PREACHER'S VOICE

(o.s.)

The last place anyone would look!


THREE-SHOT -- PREACHER, JOHN, PEARL


PREACHER makes a lunge across JOHN for the doll; JOHN ducking 

under his arm, pulls PEARL forward with his left hand; he 

turns backwards and with his free hand, in one movement, 

knocks over the candle and pulls out the support on the shelf.


CLOSE SHOT -- PREACHER


Jars shower over him; one crowns him and breaks, shedding 

guck, which he wipes from his eyes.


TWO-SHOT -- THE CHILDREN


They start up the stairs.


FULL SHOT -- PREACHER


He makes one step forward, steps on a rolling jar, and falls.


TWO-SHOT -- THE CHILDREN


They are near the top of the stairs. We hear PREACHER below 

them. JOHN slips and they nearly fall backward. As JOHN 

recovers, PREACHER enters the shot, his back to us. The 

children get through the open door as PREACHER reaches top. 

JOHN slams the door, catching PREACHER'S hand. PREACHER 

screams. JOHN'S astonished eyes peer through the crack in 

the door; the door loosens; PREACHER yanks his hand loose 

and sucks it, groaning; the door slams to; the bolt is shot 

home.


HEAD CLOSE-UP -- PREACHER


...over sound of slamming bolt. He snarls like the Big Bad 

Wolf.


All the above happens at once.


INT. KITCHEN -- CLOSE TWO-SHOT -- JOHN AND PEARL, BY DOOR


PEARL, dangling her doll, cries. JOHN panting, leans against 

wall by door. JOHN is wondering what to do now. Pause.


PREACHER'S VOICE

(o.s., sweetly)

Chilll-dren?

(continuing)

The only reason I wanted that money 

is so's you could have it.


JOHN HARPER

(to himself; panting)

The river. That's the only where! 

Uncle Birdie Steptoe!


PREACHER'S VOICE

(cooing)

Puhr-urrl? Want your Mommy back?

(Pearl hugs her doll)

Want me to get her right now?


PEARL HARPER

(sharply)

John?


JOHN HARPER

Hush, Pearl. Come on.


They fly out of the house.


PREACHER'S VOICE

(bellowing, as they 

go)

OPEN THAT DOOR, YOU SPAWN OF THE 

DEVIL'S OWN STRUMPET!


FRAMING SHOT -- EXT. THE HARPER HOUSE


A pretty, pastoral shot of the house in light mist, as they 

run across and leave the shot. Before they disappear, we 

hear PREACHER'S fists hammering against the door. We stay on 

the house at leisure; we hear him lunging, shoulder to door; 

we begin to hear squeaking of hinges and splintering of wood.


FULL CIRCLE SHOT -- FRAMING BIRDIE'S WHARF-BOAT


An ultra romantic image of shelter and peace. Frogs or river 

noises o.s., then the rattle of running footsteps. The 

children center, their backs to us, sprinting towards the 

boat. Light mist as in previous shot.


JOHN HARPER

(calling)

Uncle Birdie! Uncle Birdie!


INT. BIRDIE'S BOAT -- GROUP SHOT -- BIRDIE AND CHILDREN


We shoot over BESS'S turned photograph and over BIRDIE, close, 

passed out in his rocker. The children run through open door 

in BACKGROUND and JOHN runs up to BIRDIE.


JOHN HARPER

Uncle Birdie!


CLOSE SHOT -- BIRDIE


BIRDIE STEPTOE

(gesturing feebly)

Don't!


CLOSE TWO-SHOT -- NEW ANGLE -- BIRDIE, OVER JOHN


JOHN HARPER

Hide us Uncle Birdie! He's a-comin' 

with his knife!


He grabs BIRDIE'S shoulder; BIRDIE half-rises, and falls 

face down on floor.


CLOSE TWO-SHOT -- BIRDIE ON FLOOR, OVER JOHN


JOHN HARPER

It's me! John Harper and Pearl! You 

said to come a-runnin' if we needed 

you!


BIRDIE rears on one elbow and looks up at him.


BIRDIE STEPTOE

(in friendly 

recognition)

Johnny!


He falls face down again.


CLOSE TWO-SHOT -- NEW ANGLE -- FAVORING JOHN


JOHN grabs BIRDIE by one ear, turning his face up.


JOHN HARPER

Uncle -- Birdie! Oh -- please! Please 

wake up!


CLOSE TWO-SHOT -- FAVORING BIRDIE


He looks up earnestly at JOHN.


BIRDIE STEPTOE

I never done it, boy. Sweet Heaven I 

never done such a terrible thing! 

I'll swear on the Book to it, boy! I 

never done it! I never!


CLOSE SHOT -- JOHN


He is lost; and he becomes a man.


BIRDIE'S VOICE

(o.s.)

Lord save poor old Uncle Birdie 

Steptoe that never hurt a fly!

(he snores, softly)


JOHN HARPER

(quiet)

There's still the river. -- The skiff 

is down by the willows.


He masterfully takes PEARL by the hand and leads her into 

the night.


LONG SHOT -- THE CHILDREN


We shoot from the river. They struggle through the sumac and 

pokeberry weeds at edge of river, towards skiff, whose prow, 

tethered to willow, we see throughout this un-moving shot, 

at our extreme right. When they come opposite skiff -- which 

is a few yards out from shore --


WE CUT TO:


TWO-SHOT -- THE CHILDREN


PEARL, frankly bored, dangling her doll, is yawning. JOHN, 

as he finishes undoing rope from a willow root, looks up and 

around, checking on pursuit. His eyes fix.


FULL SHOT -- PREACHER'S SHADOW


On the bank above, it is huge in the mist. Same camera 

position as foregoing; new angle.


TWO-SHOT -- THE CHILDREN


BACK view: skiff in BACKGROUND. Same camera position; new 

angle.


JOHN HARPER

(whispering)

Please be quiet -- Oh please, Pearl!


PEARL HARPER

(natural voice)

John, where are we g --


JOHN HARPER

Hush.


FULL SHOT -- SHADOW, THEN PREACHER


Same position and angle as before.


PREACHER'S own figure advances to supplant his shadow. He 

peers downward, his open knife catching the light.


PREACHER

(businesslike)

Children?


He starts slashing his way down through the brush-filth.


FULL SHOT -- THE CHILDREN


Same camera position as before. They are floundering through 

mud, half-way to the skiff.


FULL SHOT -- PREACHER


Same position and angle as in previous shot of him. He is 

half-way down the bank. With his knife, he hacks at an 

entangling vine.


FULL SHOT -- THE CHILDREN


Position and angle as before. They reach the skiff. Hacking 

sounds o.s.


JOHN HARPER

Get in the skiff, Pearl, goodness, 

goodness, hurry!


PEARL HARPER

(hesitant)

That's Daddy!


He picks her up and throws her into the skiff.


CLOSE SHOT -- PEARL AND DOLL


...as they land, sprawling, in bottom of skiff among fish-

heads and bait cans. JOHN gets in after them.


FULL SHOT -- PREACHER -- CHILDREN'S VIEWPOINT


He tears free of brush to edge of river, knife glittering.


CLOSE SHOT -- JOHN


With his oar, he tries to push the boat free of mud.


FULL SHOT -- PREACHER -- CHILDREN'S VIEWPOINT


He wades towards them, knee-deep in mud.


CLOSE SHOT -- JOHN


He is shoving at the oar even more desperately.


INSERT -- JOHN'S HANDS


Straining.


FULL SHOT -- PREACHER -- CHILDREN'S VIEWPOINT


He flounders deeper and more heavily through the mud; much 

closer.


CLOSE SHOT -- JOHN


He pushes the boat free of mud.


CLOSE SHOT -- PREACHER -- CHILDREN'S VIEWPOINT


He hurries much closer through shallow water. Prow of boat 

in FOREGROUND.


PREACHER

Wait, you little whelps! Wait!


Another step forward and he does a pratt-fall and makes a 

splash.


CLOSE SHOT -- JOHN -- PEARL IN BACKGROUND


He is trying to feather the boat out to where the current 

will catch it. In panic and haste he is clumsy.


JOHN HARPER

Why can't I do it when I know how to 

do it!


FULL SHOT -- PREACHER


...as he gets up, at edge of mud.


PREACHER

Wait! Wait! I'll slit your guts!


FULL DOWN-SHOT -- THE SKIFF, THEN PREACHER


The current catches it and spins it round like a leaf. JOHN'S 

efforts with the oars are useless. PREACHER enters, wading 

fast. His hands are within an inch of reaching the helpless 

skiff; capriciously the current takes it downstream.


TWO-SHOT -- JOHN AND PEARL


The skiff is taken steadily by the current. PEARL sits up, 

doll in arms. JOHN is almost asleep with exhaustion.


FULL SHOT -- THE SKIFF, OVER PREACHER


It is well away from him and getting smaller. Waist-deep, he 

wades a couple of steps after it, then just looks.


HEAD CLOSE-UP -- PREACHER


He begins a steady, rhythmical, animal scream of outrage and 

loss.


LONG SHOT -- THE RIVER AND LANDSCAPE, FEATURING STARLIGHT; 

AND THE DRIFTING BOAT -- PEARL IN STERN TWO-SHOT -- THE 

CHILDREN -- FRONT ON


JOHN is asleep. PEARL sits sleepily whispering to her doll.


PEARL HARPER

Once upon a time there was a pretty 

fly, and he had a wife, this pretty 

fly...


MEDIUM LONG SHOT -- THE DRIFTING BOAT THROUGH FIREFLIES


PEARL'S VOICE

(o.s.)

...and one day she flew away, and 

then one night his two pretty fly 

children...


SPECIAL SHOT -- THE MOVING SKIFF, THROUGH DEW-JEWELED SPIDER-

WEB


PEARL'S VOICE

(o.s., continuing)

...flew away too, into the sky, into 

the moon...


SPECIAL SHOT -- A FROG, AND SKIFF


A big frog is profiled; the skiff drifts by in distance; the 

frog twangs out a bass-note.


DISSOLVE TO:


INSERT -- A PICTURE POSTCARD -- A COUNTY COURTHOUSE


As the card is turned to the handwritten side we


CUT TO:


CLOSE TWO-SHOT -- WALT AND ICEY


WALT

(reading aloud)

Dear Walt and Icey: I bet you been 

worried and gave us up for lost. 

Took the kids down here with me for 

a visit to my sister Elsie's farm. 

Thot a little change of scenery would 

do us all a world of good after so 

much trubble and heartache. At least 

the kids will git a plenty of good 

home cooking. Your devoted Harry 

Powell


ICEY SPOON

Now ain't you relieved, Walt?


WALT

Sure, but you was worried too, Mother; 

takin' off with never a word of 

goodbye. I even got to figurin' them 

gypsies busted in and done off with 

all three of 'em.


ICEY SPOON

You and your gypsies! They been gone 

a week!


WALT

Not before one of 'em knifed a farmer 

and stole his horse. Never caught 

the gypsies nor the horse.


LAP DISSOLVE TO:


DESCENDING HELICOPTER SHOT -- THE RIVER -- DAY


A man is going along a river lane on horseback.


It is PREACHER; he walks the horse away from us.


DISSOLVE TO:


DESCENDING HELICOPTER SHOT -- ANOTHER BEND OF THE RIVER


We descend to a poor riverside farmhouse; JOHN and PEARL 

tether a boat in front of it.


GROUP SHOT (FROM GROUND) THREE HOMELESS CHILDREN, OVER JOHN 

AND PEARL


They are eating hot boiled potatoes. A glance at JOHN and 

PEARL, and they turn away towards lane in BACKGROUND. JOHN 

and PEARL proceed towards the house.


MEDIUM SHOT -- JOHN, PEARL, WOMAN, THROUGH DOOR


We shoot from within open door of kitchen. JOHN and PEARL 

advance to edge of porch. A TIRED FARM WOMAN stands by door, 

within. We shoot OVER her.


TIRED FARM WOMAN

Hungry, I s'pose. Well, I'll see if 

there's any more potatoes to spare. 

Where's your folks?


JOHN HARPER

Ain't got none.


Woman leaves shot briefly (we HOLD on CHILDREN) She re-enters 

and goes to them with a bowl of steaming potatoes. They take 

hands-ful, and make to eat.


TIRED FARM WOMAN

Go 'way; go 'way.


They turn away and walk towards boat. She looks after them.


TIRED FARM WOMAN

Such times, when youngins run the 

roads!


She leaves the SHOT. We frame them briefly, walking away, 

then;


DISSOLVE TO:


CLOSE SHOT -- A PLACARD -- NIGHT


It is lit by firelight. It reads:


PEACH-PICKERS WANTED WEEKLY HIRE


PREACHER'S VOICE

(o.s.)

An ungrateful child is an 

abomination...


LAP DISSOLVE TO:


GROUP SHOT -- PREACHER AND MEN


PREACHER stands behind the flames; in FOREGROUND an OLD MAN 

sits profiled on a box. Other workers, all men, sit around 

fire.


PREACHER

(continuing)

...before the eyes of God. The world 

is fast going to damnation because 

of impudent youngins a-flyin' in the 

face of Age.


Short silence, as the other men look at PREACHER without 

liking. Then the old man spits into the fire.


CLOSE SHOT -- THE FLAMES


A spurt of steam as spit strikes.


CLOSE SHOT -- A HOOT OWL

We shoot OVER two sitting rabbits as they watch, their ears 

up. The skiff passes. PEARL plays with doll JOHN unsnarls 

line.


LAP DISSOLVE TO:


FULL SHOT -- THE CHILDREN AND SKIFF, FRAMED BY WILLOWS -- 

TWILIGHT


The skiff passes. Baa-ing of sheep o.s.


MOVING SHOT -- FROM RIVER -- A SHEEP


The sheep bleats. We PAN in a big barn near the river, then 

a lighted house; willows along shore.


FULL SHOT -- THE SKIFF -- FROM THE BANK


JOHN re-sets his oar. They angle towards us for the shore.


JOHN HARPER

We're gonna spend a night on land.


UP-SHOT -- THE CHILDREN, OVER THE MOORED SKIFF

window in BACKGROUND. Sounds of mouth-organ and girl singing 

o.s.


FULL SHOT -- A LIGHTED WINDOW, THE SHADE DRAWN


A wire bird-cage hangs close to the shade, silhouetted. On 

the perch, a canary. Lullaby and mouth-organ continue o. s. 

After a moment the CHILDREN enter, backs to us, and stop, 

looking.


CLOSE TWO-SHOT -- THE CHILDREN


Window-light on faces, song over. A moment.


PEARL HARPER

Are we goin' home, John?


JOHN HARPER

Ssh...


He turns, her hand in his. We PAN as they tiptoe towards the 

big, open door of barn; big open hayloft window above.


INT. ROOM -- LOW TRACKING SHOT -- THE CHILDREN


As they walk down aisle of barn we shoot them past bellies 

and legs of row of cows. Sounds of munching and soft lowing 

o.s. JOHN helps PEARL up a little ladder to the hayloft.


MEDIUM SHOT -- THE CHILDREN, WINDOW -- TWILIGHT


...as the CHILDREN bed down in hay, only legs visible, 

protruding into frame of window, which frames a middle-distant 

white lane beyond house, and a landscape. Whippoorwill o.s. 

A DARKENING OF LIGHT.

The moon is still higher. A pause; the whippoorwill stops in

CLOSE SHOT -- JOHN


He listens intently. We hear nothing. His eyes alter. We 

hear, distantly


PREACHER'S VOICE

(o.s., singing)

Leaning, Leaning...


At various distances o.s., we hear dogs barking at the sound 

of the singing.


PREACHER'S VOICE

The dog from the farm rushes braying to his gate. Other dogs 

continue o.s. PREACHER appears, astride his walking horse, 

singing.


PREACHER

Leaning...


CLOSE SHOT -- JOHN


Watching; dread and despair. Sounds go.


PREACHER

(o.s.)

Leaning; Leaning on the Everlasting 

Arms.

He approaches and crosses center screen, continuing the hymn.

Eyes following PREACHER. PREACHER and dogs continue o.s.

Don't you never sleep?


FULL SHOT -- PREACHER


He vanishes beyond trees, his singing more distant. Dogs

CLOSE SHOT -- JOHN AND PEARL -- NEW ANGLE


He wakes her. PREACHER'S singing o.s.


JOHN HARPER

Pearl, wake up! Come on, Pearl!


FULL SHOT -- PREACHER


He vanishes; scuttling of children in hay, o.s.; dogs quiet; 

his song dies. Brief silence. The whippoorwill resumes.

FULL SHOT -- PEARL, THEN RACHEL, OVER JOHN


PEARL is picking daisies. A fence up beyond her. Beyond the 

fence, a woman, RACHEL COOPER, appears. She carries a berry-

basket on her arm. JOHN scrambles up, grabs an oar, and holds 

it defensively. PEARL freezes.


RACHEL COOPER

(loud)

You two youngsters get up here to me 

this instant!


TWO-SHOT -- JOHN AND PEARL -- RACHEL'S ANGLE


RACHEL COOPER

(o.s.)

Mind me now!


JOHN lowers the oar at the female authority in her voice.


RACHEL COOPER

(o.s.)

Now git on up to my house.


They hesitate.


THREE-SHOT -- OVER JOHN


RACHEL COOPER

I'll git me a willow switch.


They still hesitate. She breaks off a switch and comes for 

them, squishing through the mud. She surrounds them and drives 

them like geese up the bank.


LOW FULL SHOT -- THE THREE, FROM SIDE


They move across the meadow like a nursery frieze. She tweaks 

with her switch. As she goes near PEARL'S calves, JOHN turns.


JOHN HARPER

Don't you hurt her!


RACHEL COOPER

Hurt her nothin'! Wash her's more 

like it!

(hand to mouth, yelling)

Ruby!


FULL SHOT -- A TOMATO PATCH


Three crouching figures pick tomatoes beyond a low white 

fence; Rachel's house in background. RUBY, thirteen, pops 

her head up like a rifle-target.

Clary, eleven, pops up.


RACHEL COOPER

Mary, four, pops up.


THE GIRLS

(in chorus)

Yes Miz Cooper!


GROUP SHOT -- RACHEL AND HARPERS, MOVING TOWARDS FENCE


She has JOHN and PEARL by their napes.


RACHEL COOPER

Bring yer baskets.


The three girls enter, their backs to us, carrying baskets 

of tomatoes.


GROUP SHOT -- THE GIRLS, OVER RACHEL AND HARPER CHILDREN


She holds JOHN and PEARL very firmly, inspecting baskets, 

across gate of fence.


RACHEL COOPER

Nicely picked, Clary. Mary; put the 

big ones on top. Ruby, most o' them 

ain't fit to go to market. Put them 

baskets down. Ruby, fetch the washtub 

and put it by the pump. Mary, Clary, 

fetch me a bar o' laundry soap and 

the scrub brush.


GIRLS

(in chorus)

Yes Miz Cooper!


They hurry off.


RACHEL COOPER

Come on, now; up to the house.


She opens the gate, pushes the Harper children through, shuts 

the gate, and walks between them, her back to us. The children 

hesitate. She turns to them and stops.


THREE-SHOT -- THE CHILDREN, OVER RACHEL


She looks them up and down. If we saw her face, her lips 

would be pursed and working with anger.


RACHEL COOPER

Gracious! If you hain't a sight to 

beat all! Where you from?


No answer; their eyes are wide with curiosity.


RACHEL COOPER

Where's your folks?


CLOSE SHOT -- JOHN


RACHEL COOPER

(o.s.)

Speak up now!


His eyes go down to her feet. He, and we, start to examine 

her from foot to head; for this is our heroine at last.


CLOSE TILTING SHOT -- RACHEL


...from JOHN'S eye-level. We TILT SLOWLY UP her height. She 

wears man's shoes, heavy with mud; a rough skirt; a shapeless 

sweater hangs over her shoulders; she is in her middle sixties 

and wears a man's old hat. Her face says:


RACHEL COOPER

(sort of roughly)

Gracious! So I've got two more mouths 

to feed!


CLOSE SHOT -- JOHN


For no reason at all he feels he has come home.


LAP DISSOLVE TO:


GROUP SHOT -- JOHN, PEARL, RACHEL, RUBY, DURING WASHING

Hating the scrubbing. He breaks away.


FULL SHOT -- JOHN AND RACHEL


JOHN dodges behind a bush, RACHEL in hot pursuit.

WITH DAMP MUSLIN

BROOD


All carry baskets. RACHEL charges along at the head of the

CATTLE DEALER

Howdy Miz Cooper -- you goin' to 

sell me yer hog this year?


RACHEL doesn't stop walking.


RACHEL COOPER

With the price o' pork what it is?


CLOSE TRACKING SHOT -- RACHEL


She keeps walking.


RACHEL COOPER

You-all have your work cut out!

JOHN HARPER

She talks to herself.


CLARY

JOHN HARPER

Your Maw's funny.

her house.


They walk in silence.


JOHN HARPER

Where's your folks?


CLARY

Some place.


MARY

My Daddy's in Dee-troit.


JOHN HARPER

(to Ruby)

Who's your folks?


RUBY

I dunno.


FULL SHOT -- THE STREET


A WAITRESS, wearing an apron labeled EMPIRE EATS, hurries 

across the street towards the GROUP. We PAN her in to MARY. 

The procession halts briefly. She embraces MARY.


WAITRESS

Mary! Honey! Mornin' Miz Cooper.

(to Mary)

Guess what! I'm savin' up to buy ye 

a charm bracelet!


CLOSE SHOT -- RACHEL


RACHEL COOPER

Never mind the gewgaws; don't you

The WAITRESS hurries away. She dodges past a car.


WAITRESS

See ye Sunday, love!

she follows WAITRESS, then LOVERS in car, with her eyes.


FULL STREET SHOT


The car CENTERS, held up in traffic; two lovers in it, sitting 

close.


CLOSE SHOT -- RACHEL


She takes in the LOVERS.


RACHEL COOPER

Women is durn fools! All of 'em!


She sighs, angry at all women, herself included, and turns 

away. We are at the door of a GROCERY STORE. The GROCER is 

on his doorstep.


FULL SHOT -- GROUP AND GROCERY


RACHEL COOPER

(to children)

Take yer baskets in.


The CHILDREN file in past her and GROCER.


RACHEL COOPER

(to Grocer)

Looky there.

(she indicates the 

lovers)

She'll be losin' her mind to a tricky 

mouth and a full moon, and like as 

not I'll be saddled with the 

consequences.


She starts into store with the GROCER.


INT. STORE -- GROUP SHOT -- RACHEL, GROCER, CHILDREN


RACHEL and GROCER come up to counter.


RACHEL COOPER

(continuing; she takes 

a list from her bosom 

and gives it to Grocer)

Here's what you owe me.

(she counts baskets)

One, two, three, four, five... where's 

the other basket? Where's Ruby?


CLARY

She went.


RACHEL COOPER

John: you go fetch Ruby.

(John goes. As Grocer 

empties baskets and 

tots up, Rachel 

continues:)

Big Ruby's my problem girl. She can't 

gather eggs without bustin' 'em; but 

Ruby's got mother hands with a 

youngin, so what're you to say?


EXT. DRUG STORE -- FULL SHOT -- RUBY


She stands with her market-basket, reacting to wolf whistles 

o.s.; she is seeking the world.


THREE-SHOT -- RUBY, OVER TWO YOUNG LOAFERS


1ST LOAFER

RUBY gestures RACHEL'S nearness.


2ND LOAFER

1ST LOAFER

The Old Lady's around.

RUBY nods.


1ST LOAFER

The old gal thinks she comes in fer 

sewin' lessons o'-Thursday.


FULL SHOT -- RUBY; JOHN IN BACKGROUND


JOHN HARPER

He turns and goes; RUBY, with an eye to 1ST LOAFER, turns 

and follows.


INT. GROCERY STORE -- GROUP SHOT -- CENTERING RACHEL


GROCER

(to Pearl)

And will you show me your dolly, 

little lady?


JOHN has entered in BACKGROUND. PEARL holds the doll to her, 

and JOHN moves in quietly to her side. They stand together, 

as so often before.


GROCER

See ye got two more peeps to your 

brood.


RACHEL COOPER

Yeah, and ornerier than the rest.


GROCER

How's your own boy, Miz Cooper?


RACHEL COOPER

Ain't heard from Ralph since last 

Christmas. Don't matter -- I've got 

a new crop.

(she laughs. Loudly)

I'm a strong tree with branches for 

many birds. I'm good for something 

in this old world and I know it, 

too! We know that she will rout the 

Devil.


GROCER

(a good tradesman)

Got a good buy in soap, Miz Cooper.


RACHEL COOPER

(triumphant)

Don't need no soap. I'm boilin' down 

the fat from my hog.


DISSOLVE TO:


INT. RACHEL'S SCREENED PORCH -- EVENING -- GROUP SHOT -- 

RACHEL, GIRLS, JOHN ASIDE


CENTERING RACHEL as she takes a book from table, and the 

GIRLS MOVE to set at her seat, and JOHN stands to one side. 

RACHEL glances at him.


CLOSE SHOT -- JOHN


He looks suspiciously to the Book in her hands, for to him 

it has come to mean only Preacher.


INSERT -- THE BIBLE


...as she opens it on her lap o.s. we hear a screen door 

open.


GROUP SHOT -- RACHEL, CHILDREN, JOHN IN BACKGROUND


We see the door closing as JOHN goes out. The girls sit on 

low stools in semi-circle at RACHEL'S feet. We CENTER RACHEL. 

RACHEL, keenly aware of JOHN, pretends to ignore him. JOHN 

crosses behind her and stands with his back to us. We see 

the back of his head through the screen. RACHEL, changing 

her mind about what story to tell, finds the new page she's 

after, and spreads her hands flat on the pages. She never 

glances at the text. She is fishing for JOHN.


RACHEL COOPER

Now old Pharoah, he was the King of 

Egyptland! And he had a daughter, 

and once upon a time

(louder)

she was walkin' along the river bank 

and she seen somethin' bumpin' and 

scrapin' along down on a sandbar 

under the willows.

RESUME GROUP SHOT


RUBY, CLARY, MARY

No!


PEARL HARPER

No!


RACHEL COOPER

Well, now, it was a skiff, washed up 

on the bar. And who do you reckon 

was in it?


RUBY

(confidently)

Pearl and John!


RACHEL COOPER

(still loud)

Not this time! It was just one youngin -- 

a little boy babe. And do you know 

who he was, children?


CLOSE SHOT -- JOHN'S HEAD


...as he turns around.


RUBY, MARY, CLARY, PEARL

(o.s. in unison)

No!


RESUME GROUP SHOT


RACHEL closes the Bible; she knows the Lord's battle is won. 

As she continues, she puts aside the book and takes up her 

mending.


RACHEL COOPER

(very quietly)

It was Moses! -- A King of men, Moses, 

children. Now. Off to bed. Hurry.


On "off to bed," JOHN turns his back again.


CLOSE SHOT -- RACHEL; JOHN IN BACKGROUND


She mends for a few moments.


RACHEL COOPER

(commandingly)

John, git me an apple.


JOHN crosses behind her and off, towards door. We hear it 

open and close.


RACHEL COOPER

Git one for yourself, too.


MEDIUM SHOT -- JOHN


He approaches with two apples. We PAN him into a:


TWO-SHOT -- JOHN AND RACHEL


He gives her an apple. She immediately takes a bite. He 

doesn't bite his. She looks up at him from her apple.


RACHEL COOPER

(suddenly)

John, where's your folks?


JOHN HARPER

(plainly)

Dead.


RACHEL COOPER

Dead.

(she nods with finality)


JOHN starts to eat his apple.


RACHEL COOPER

Where ye from?


JOHN HARPER

Up river.


RACHEL COOPER

I didn't figger ye rowed that skiff 

from Parkersburg!


JOHN makes a move; he slowly and tenderly reaches out his 

hand and lays his fingers on her knuckles.


JOHN HARPER

Tell me that story again.


Our heroine would like to thank the Lord openly, but she 

knows she must not show her feelings; she speaks gruffly --


RACHEL COOPER

Story, honey? Why, what story?


JOHN HARPER

About them Kings. That the Queen 

found down on the sandbar in the 

skiff that time.


RACHEL COOPER

Kings! Why, honey, there was only 

one.


JOHN HARPER

I mind you said there was two.


RACHEL COOPER

Well, shoot! Maybe there was!


CLOSE SHOT -- RACHEL


Maybe we see -- though JOHN does not -- the thanksgiving in 

her eyes.


RACHEL COOPER

Yes, come to think of it, there was 

two, John.


o.s., in distance, we hear the whistle of a river boat.


DISSOLVE TO:

Her head and shoulders from behind as she walks down the 

neon-lighted street; drugstore and loafers in b.g.; jazz

Our two loafers lounge on a bench. RUBY approaches.


2ND LOAFER

Hey. Must be Thursday.


1ST LOAFER

He gets up and starts towards RUBY, who catches his eye.


RUBY, FROM BEHIND


She turns to a magazine stand and fingers a magazine, awaiting 

LOAFER, who approaches in BACKGROUND.


INSERT -- RUBY'S HAND; MAGAZINES


They are lurid, tawdry fan and pin-up magazines.


PREACHER enters, between RUBY and LOAFER, and turns to RUBY 

into CLOSE TWO-SHOT. LOAFER pauses in BACKGROUND.


PREACHER

You're Ruby, ain't you, my child?


RUBY

Can I have this?


PREACHER

Surely. I'd like to talk to you, my 

dear.


RUBY

Will you buy me a choclit sody?

O' course.

PREACHER.

INT. DRUGSTORE -- CLOSE TWO-SHOT -- PREACHER AND RUBY


RUBY is finishing her soda.


RUBY

Ain't I purty?


This is a familiar clue to PREACHER.


PREACHER

Why, you're the purtiest girl I've 

seen in all my wandering. Didn't 

nobody never tell you that, Ruby?


RUBY

(hoarsely)

No. No one never did.


PREACHER

(moving in)

There's two new ones over at your 

place, ain't there Ruby?


She nods.


PREACHER

What's their names?


RUBY

PREACHER

Ahhh.

(whispering)

And is there -- a doll?


RUBY

Only she won't never let me play 

with it.


PREACHER

Ahh!


He gets up and heads for door. RUBY, dismayed, hurries after 

him.


PREACHER

Yes!


He strides through door, RUBY following.


THREE-SHOT -- PREACHER AND RUBY ON SIDEWALK, 2ND LOAFER IN 

B.G. 1ST LOAFER HAS GONE


PREACHER comes out fast, RUBY touches his arm, he turns on 

her. They are in CLOSE TWO-SHOT. RUBY goes on tiptoe. PREACHER 

inclines his ear.


CLOSE SHOT -- RUBY


RUBY

Did you ever see such purty eyes in 

all your born days?

It slides into his knife pocket. We hear a click.

THREE-SHOT -- PREACHER AND RUBY, LOAFER IN B.G.


RUBY

He ain't like you-all! Next time I 

won't even ask him to buy me a sody!


She turns to PREACHER, but PREACHER, on "next time," has 

left the SHOT.


CLOSE SHOT -- RUBY


She looks after him, clasping the magazine under her chin.


FULL SHOT -- PREACHER


Her hero strides away into darkness.

RUBY

RACHEL COOPER

RACHEL COOPER

The Drugstore?


RUBY

Miz Cooper. I never went to sewin' 

lessons all them times.


RACHEL COOPER

What you been up to?


RUBY

I been out with men.


RUBY collapses face down over RACHEL'S lap and sobs, as we 

TRACK IN CLOSE.


RACHEL COOPER

Dear God, child!


Now RACHEL also weeps. She bends low over RUBY, stroking her 

hair.


RACHEL COOPER

You was lookin' for love, Ruby, the 

only foolish way you knowed how.

(she lifts Ruby's 

face cheek to cheek 

beside her own)

We all need love. Ruby, I lost the 

love of my son -- I've found it with 

you-all.


They weep together.


RACHEL COOPER

You must grow up to be a fine, full 

woman; and I'm goin' to see to it 

you do.


She starts making up RUBY'S hair like that of a young woman.


RUBY

This gentleman warn't like them! He 

just give me a sody and the book.


RACHEL COOPER

Now who was this?


RUBY

He never asked me for nothin'.


RACHEL COOPER

He must have wanted somethin', Ruby. 

A man don't waste time on a girl 

unless he gets something.


RUBY shakes her head.


RACHEL COOPER

What'd you all talk about?


RUBY

Pearl and John.


RACHEL COOPER

PREACHER'S face twitches with emotion. He breaks out into 

great thankful sobs. He falls to his knees.

hoped to see them again in this world! 

Oh, dear Madam, if you was to know 

what a thorny crown I have borne in 

my search for these strayed chicks!

He turns his head.


FULL SHOT -- RACHEL AND PREACHER, FROM SIDE


All the CHILDREN enter, around corner of house. As they move 

in, RACHEL replies:


RACHEL COOPER

A sight better than they was.


By now JOHN is on the top step beside RACHEL. One of his 

hands holds on to her skirt, as if he were pulling her towards 

him. His eyes never leave hers. All the CHILDREN freeze, 

PEARL is on ground, just beyond JOHN. Others in BACKGROUND; 

RUBY as near PREACHER as she can get.


PREACHER

Gracious, gracious! You are a good 

woman, Miz Cooper!


RACHEL COOPER

How you figgerin' to raise them two 

without a woman?


PREACHER

PEARL, with a wail of happiness, drops the DOLL on the step 

and runs to PREACHER, who picks her up. JOHN instantly picks 

up the DOLL and holds it to him. He looks up at RACHEL.

JOHN looks deep into RACHEL'S eyes.

JOHN HARPER

He ain't my Dad.

She takes this in; JOHN has sold her. She looks to PREACHER

JOHN ducks under the porch and PREACHER tries to follow him. 

He can't get under. o.s. we hear the slam of the screen door. 

PREACHER'S head comes up to see and we TILT UP, shooting 

OVER the back of his head. RACHEL stands there, full figure,

Back of PREACHER'S head is still immobile.


RACHEL COOPER

March, Mister! I'm not foolin'.


CLOSE SHOT -- PREACHER, OVER GUN-BARREL


PREACHER gets to his feet. The open knife is in his hand. As 

we see it, the gun-barrel twitches. PREACHER backs away 

towards his horse, bouncing the knife lightly in his hand.

And he heard tell of this little

you reckon they went and done?


CLARY

They hid in a broom closet!


MARY

They hid under the porch!


HEAD CLOSE-UP -- JOHN


JOHN HARPER

No; they went a-runnin'.


TWO-SHOT -- RACHEL AND JOHN


RACHEL COOPER

Well now, John, that's just what 

they done! They went a-runnin!


The clock starts striking three. RACHEL looks to sound o.s.


FULL SHOT -- CLOCK AND HALL MIRROR, BEYOND DARK KITCHEN


In the mirror, a shadow ducks.


FULL GROUP SHOT -- RACHEL AND CHILDREN


RACHEL gets up, gun at port, and faces into the darkness.


PREACHER

(o.s.)

Figured I was gone, eh?


Eyes on the darkness, she bends low to the CHILDREN.


RACHEL COOPER

(whispering)

Run hide in the staircase! Run quick!


They scatter out of shot; RUBY lingers.


RACHEL COOPER

(without turning to 

her)

Ruby, git.


RUBY obeys in a trance. RACHEL, gun at ready, looks into the 

darkness.


FULL SCREEN -- DARKNESS


Pause.


RACHEL COOPER

(o.s.; in a high, 

steady voice)

What do you want?


PREACHER

(o.s.)

Them kids!


RACHEL COOPER

(o.s.)

What are you after them for?


PREACHER

(o.s.)

None of your business, Madam.


RACHEL COOPER

I'm givin' you to the count of three 

to get out that screen door; then 

I'm a-comin' across this kitchen 

shootin'!


A stepped-on cat screams o.s. and PREACHER'S satanic face, 

and his hand lifting the open knife, rise swiftly from floor.


FULL FIGURE SHOT -- RACHEL -- SAME SHOT AS BEFORE


She fires off her gun.


FULL SHOT -- SCREEN DOOR


PREACHER staggers out and runs yelping with pain into the 

barn. o.s. we hear the zing-zing of a country phone being 

cranked.


GROUP SHOT -- RACHEL, OVER BACKS OF CHILDREN'S HEADS


They huddle on the stairs in reverent silence. RACHEL, her 

gun slung sportily under one arm, talks into wall phone which 

hangs just within the box stairway.


RACHEL COOPER

Miz Booher? Rachel Cooper. Git them 

State Troopers out to my place. I 

done treed somep'n up in my barn.


DISSOLVE TO:


FULL SHOT -- RACHEL AND JOHN


RACHEL sits on the screened porch, awake, gun on knees. JOHN 

sits on floor, asleep, his head leaning against her. Barn in 

BACKGROUND. Sunrise.


CLOSE SHOT -- RACHEL AND JOHN


Same position. JOHN awakes.


JOHN HARPER

I'll see to Pearl.


RACHEL COOPER

I'll make coffee.


They get up and start into kitchen.


GROUP SHOT -- THE CHILDREN, OVER RACHEL AND JOHN


They lie huddled in calm sleep. JOHN and RACHEL watch a 

moment.


JOHN HARPER

She's all right.


They start for the stove.


TWO-SHOT -- RACHEL AND JOHN, AROUND STOVE


RACHEL puts her gun beside the stove, ready to hand, and 

picks up a coffee-pot; JOHN puts kindling in stove.


RACHEL COOPER

John, you know? When you're little 

you have more endurance than God is 

ever to grant you again? Children 

are Man at his strongest. They abide.


JOHN looks at her a moment. o.s. we hear police car sirens. 

They look towards the sound.


FULL SHOT -- THROUGH POLICE CAR WINDSHIELD


We SHOOT OVER two TROOPERS. Sirens loud, they rapidly approach 

RACHEL'S house as RACHEL, without gun, holding JOHN'S hand, 

comes down to fence. Presently, the other CHILDREN hurry out 

of house behind. The car brakes.


FULL SHOT -- RACHEL AND CHILDREN OVER TWO POLICE CARS -- 

BARN IN BACKGROUND


The TROOPERS, fanning wide, advance towards barn. RACHEL and 

the CHILDREN are grouped a short distance behind them. The 

barn door gapes black. Short pause; then PREACHER appears.


A TROOPER

(shouting)

Is that him, Ma'am?


RACHEL COOPER

(shouting)

Yes! Mind where you shoot, boys! 

There's children here!


TROOPER

Whyn't you call us up before?


RACHEL COOPER

Didn't want yer big feet trackin' up 

my clean floors.


CLOSE SHOT -- PREACHER


He stands, swaying; his left arm is bloody and helpless. In 

his right hand the open knife hangs apathetic. His eyes are 

glazed. He does not seem to care whether they come or not.


TROOPER'S VOICE

(o.s.)

Harry Powell, you're under arrest 

for the murder of Willa Harper!


MEDIUM SHOT -- PREACHER AND TROOPERS -- JOHN'S VIEWPOINT


TROOPERS close in on PREACHER, from before and behind, exactly 

as for BEN'S arrest.


CLOSE SHOT -- JOHN


The same sickly look, as at BEN'S arrest.


MEDIUM SHOT -- PREACHER AND TROOPERS -- JOHN'S VIEWPOINT


One TROOPER smacks the back of PREACHER'S head with a pistol-

barrel.


CLOSE SHOT -- JOHN


JOHN HARPER

(shouting)

Don't!


RESUME VIEWPOINT SHOT


Another TROOPER, with a pistol barrel, knocks the knife from 

PREACHER'S lifted hand.


CLOSE SHOT -- JOHN


JOHN HARPER

(shouting)

Don't!


RESUME VIEWPOINT SHOT


PREACHER sinks to his knees as both men, and two others from 

the front, close in on him. The tableau is the same as in 

BEN'S arrest.


CLOSE SHOT -- JOHN


JOHN HARPER

(shouting)

Dad!


FRONT GROUP SHOT -- RACHEL AND CHILDREN


JOHN grabs the DOLL from PEARL and starts to run.


RACHEL COOPER

John! John!


She starts after him.


FULL SHOT -- TROOPERS, JOHN, RACHEL, OVER PREACHER


PREACHER prostrate along bottom of screen. TROOPERS are 

beating him. JOHN runs up from BACKGROUND followed by RACHEL. 

JOHN rushes among the TROOPERS, flogging PREACHER over the 

head with the DOLL. The TROOPERS, astounded, lay off. RACHEL 

is stopped in her tracks.


JOHN HARPER

Here! Here! Take it back! I can't 

stand it, Dad! It's too much, Dad! I 

don't want it! I can't do it! Here! 

Here!


The DOLL has burst open and the money has spilled over 

PREACHER. Now two TROOPERS gently lift JOHN away. RACHEL 

lifts him in her arms; she turns towards house.


FULL FIGURE PULL SHOT -- RACHEL AND JOHN -- GROUP IN 

BACKGROUND


She carries JOHN towards the house. His head hangs back over 

her arm. We hear his dry, exhausted sobs.


INT. COURTROOM -- DAY -- CLOSE SHOT -- ICEY


ICEY SPOON

(yelling)

Lynch him! Lynch him!


TWO-SHOT -- WALT AND ICEY


ICEY SPOON

(yelling)

Bluebeard!


WALT

(yelling at all the 

men around him)

Twenty-five wives!


ICEY SPOON

And he killed every last one of 'em!


GROUP SHOT -- WALT, ICEY, MEMBERS OF COURTROOM AUDIENCE


Perhaps ten faces. Most are frenetic. Our two LOAFERS are 

having fun. General hubbub o.s. A gavel o.s.


ICEY SPOON

(yelling)

If the People of Marshall County...


LOAFERS

(cynically, across 

her)

Bluebeard! Bluebeard!


CLOSE SHOT -- JOHN


He looks to sound of gavel. The hubbub and the gaveling stop.


LAWYER

(o.s.)

Will you identify the prisoner?


JOHN looks over his shoulder in same direction as the gavel.


LAWYER

(o.s.)

Please, little lad. Won't you look 

yonder...

(his pointing finger 

enters the shot. 

John shakes as if he 

had a cold)

...and tell the Court if that is the 

man who killed your mother?


JOHN looks at the finger. Short pause.


LAWYER

(o.s.)

It's all right, Mrs. Cooper. You can 

take the little fellow away.


The LAWYER'S hands gently help him from chair.


GROUP SHOT -- RACHEL AND CHILDREN


...as LAWYER'S hands consign JOHN to RACHEL.


LAWYER

Merry Christmas to you and yours, 

Mrs. Cooper.


The CHILDREN bob and reply, ad lib, "Merry Christmas to you." 

RACHEL sniffs.


LAWYER

(o.s.)

And what's Santy Claus going to bring 

you, little man?


Above JOHN'S head, by winding and holding to ear, RACHEL 

pantomimes a watch.


LAWYER

(o.s.)

O-ho-oo-o!


ICEY SPOON

(o.s.)

Them is the ones he sinned against, 

my friends!


Gaveling starts.


LOAFER

(o.s.)

Bluebeard! Bluebeard!


CROWD

(o.s.)

Bluebeard! Bluebeard!


As RACHEL and CHILDREN turn to go, gaveling and hubbub fade 

and we


LAP DISSOLVE TO:


INT. A CAFE -- NIGHT


RACHEL and her CHILDREN sit in two booths, in a corner, next 

to a big front window. Christmas parcels on bench at RACHEL'S 

right.


FULL SHOT -- RACHEL AND HER GROUP, THEN CAFE AND WINDOW


Sound o.s. of approaching crowd. As we PULL BACK we bring in 

a few other customers and the big window. There are Christmas 

decorations in the cafe and the street outside is hung with 

them. Thirty feverish people, some of whom carry torches, 

enter the scene; ICEY stares in the window and screams.


ICEY SPOON

(high-pitched)

Them's hers!


Everyone in the cafe stands up. RACHEL gathers her parcels. 

ICEY rushes to door and opens it.


ICEY SPOON

Them's her orphans!


She turns to crowd.


RACHEL COOPER

Where's Ruby?


CLARY

She went.


ICEY shouts into the cafe.


ICEY SPOON

Them poor little lambs!


ICEY turns to the street mob. RACHEL hurries her CHILDREN to 

door.


ICEY leaves door to yell at mob.


ICEY SPOON

Them's the ones he sinned against, 

my friends!


CASHIER

(across Icey)

Go out the back way, Miz Cooper.


As RACHEL leaves SHOT, the CASHIER shuts and locks the door.


EXT. BACK ALLEY -- NIGHT -- PANNING SHOT -- RACHEL AND 

COMPANY EMERGING FROM DOOR


MARY and CLARY come out first and start walking to our left. 

RACHEL comes out and hurries off to our right, followed by 

JOHN, holding PEARL'S hand.


We PAN to MARY and CLARY.


CLARY

Ain't we goin' to the Bus Depot?


No answer. They turn and we PAN with them as they hurry after 

RACHEL, and we bring in RACHEL, charging away from us with 

her brood hustling to keep up.


GROUP SHOT -- FEATURING WALT AND ICEY


ICEY carries a torch. She is flanked by rabid faces and by 

smiling LOAFERS, one of whom carries an axe. As she speaks, 

a MAN rushes up to WALT and gives him a rope.


ICEY SPOON

(shouting; high-pitched)

Draggin' the name of the Lord through 

the evil mud of his soul!


WALT

(bellowing)

Come on!


They all start marching, in step.


PANNING SHOT -- RACHEL AND CHILDREN


Marching and voices o.s. and in BACKGROUND.


Carrying Christmas parcels, they hurry alongside a building 

and, at CENTER of PAN, cross the end of a street.


The MOB marches down the street TOWARDS CAMERA; Men run to 

join it.


ICEY SPOON

(high-pitched)

He lied!


WALT

Tricked us!


ICEY SPOON

He taken the Lord's name in vain and 

he trampled on His Holy Book!


WALT

String that Bluebeard up to a pole!


ICEY SPOON

He's Satan hiding behind the Cross!


OTHERS

(ad lib)

Lynch him! String him up!


We PAN RACHEL and CHILDREN past this street and they hurry 

towards RUBY, who stands alone in BACKGROUND, facing the 

jail.


HEAD CLOSE-UP -- RUBY'S ECSTATIC FACE


In BACKGROUND, RACHEL and CHILDREN hurry towards her. MOB 

noise o.s. Hearing the approach of RACHEL'S GROUP, RUBY turns 

the back of her head towards us. Now there are no mob voices; 

only the ominous sound of fifty-odd people marching in step.


RUBY

I love him!


TRACKING SHOT -- RUBY


Ominous silence.


RUBY

He loves me because I'm so purty! 

You think he's like them others!


SIDE TRACKING SHOT -- RUBY, RACHEL AND GROUP


Marching sound o.s.


RACHEL firmly takes RUBY'S arm and drags her off in our 

direction. RACHEL shoos MARY and CLARY ahead of her. JOHN 

and PEARL flank RACHEL, clinging to her wide skirts. RUBY, 

nearest us, keeps looking back over her shoulder. We TRACK 

them along side of JAIL to rear of JAIL.


RUBY

(continuing)

You took on something awful about 

him buying me that there movie book. 

You was so mad you shot him and the 

blue men took him.


On "blue men," we stop TRACKING and, as GROUP leaves SHOT, 

CENTER a POLICE CAR, waiting at rear door of JAIL. POLICEMEN 

start out of door.


MEDIUM GROUP SHOT -- POLICEMEN AND PREACHER


They roughly hustle PREACHER into the car. Marching sound 

o.s.


SHOT -- FROM WITHIN CAR -- BART


PREACHER and POLICE are in b.g. Through car window we see 

BART the HANGMAN come out of his door. He wears his derby. A 

POLICEMAN puts head out of window. Marching sound o.s.


MEDIUM SHOT -- BART THE HANGMAN


On porch, by door, is a doll's perambulator, but this time 

there is a Christmas wreath on the door. Marching o.s.


POLICEMAN

(o.s.)

Hey Bart!


Auto engine starts up o.s.


HEAD CLOSE-UP -- BART


BART

Yeah?


MEDIUM SHOT -- BART


Marching o.s.


POLICEMAN

(o.s.)

We're savin' this bird up fer you!


HEAD CLOSE-UP -- BART


Marching o.s.


BART

This time it'll be a privilege.


FULL PANNING SHOT -- POLICE CAR, THEN RACHEL AND GROUP


The car jumps fast out of SHOT and we PAN PAST BART and CENTER 

RACHEL and GROUP, walking fast away from us. Mob voices o.s.


A VOICE

(o.s., over departing 

car)

Bust the door down!


CLOSE GROUP SHOT -- RACHEL AND CHILDREN


Clutching Christmas parcels they hurry away from us into 

darkness. RUBY, hanging back, dragged by RACHEL, babbles 

over her shoulder.


RUBY

(happily)

They'll git him out. I'll git my 

things ready -- my shawl and my Mickey 

Mouse wristwatch that don't run and 

the straw hat with the flower, and 

we'll be married and live happily 

ever after!


VOICES

(o.s. ad lib, cutting 

across Ruby)

Bust the door down! Set fahr to it! 

Where's that axe! Climb up on the 

balcony! You six git 'round to the 

back!


ICEY SPOON

(o.s., screaming)

People of Marshall County!


DISSOLVE TO:


FULL SHOT -- NIGHT LANDSCAPE -- PINE TREES, AND SOFTLY FALLING 

SNOW


DISSOLVE TO:


EXT. RACHEL'S HOUSE -- EVENING; SNOWING -- CLOSE SHOT -- 

RACHEL AT MAILBOX


She peers into empty mailbox.


RACHEL COOPER

Nothing!


She slams the box shut and, as we TILT and PAN, walks away 

from us through snow towards her lighted house.


RACHEL COOPER

I'm glad they didn't send me nothing! 

Whenever they do it's never nothing 

I want but something to show me how 

fancy and smart they've come up in 

the world.


She goes into the house.


INT. RACHEL'S KITCHEN


It is decorated for Christmas.


GROUP SHOT -- RACHEL AND CHILDREN


Rachel enters; the four girls stand in line, packages ready; 

JOHN stands in b.g., in doorway to next room.


MARY

Can we give you your presents now?


CLOSE SHOT -- RACHEL


RACHEL COOPER

Shoot! You don't mean to say you got 

me a present!


Their hands hold packages up to her.


RACHEL COOPER

Shoot now!


She takes a package.


CLOSE SHOT -- JOHN


RACHEL COOPER

(o.s.)

Why, Ruby!


Embarrassed, JOHN leaves the shot.


RACHEL COOPER

(o.s.)

A POT-HOLDER!


CLOSE SHOT -- JOHN -- NEW ANGLE


From a fruit bowl, he selects the biggest apple, shines it 

on his shirt, wraps it in the doily under his bowl, opens a 

drawer and gets out a clip clothespin, clips his package, 

and leaves shot.


RACHEL COOPER

(o.s., continuing)

And much neater than last year's, 

Ruby!

(Sound of tearing 

gift-paper o.s.)

(o.s.)

And Clary! ANOTHER POT-HOLDER! Ain't 

that thoughtful. I'm always burnin' 

my hands.


FULL SHOT -- RACHEL, AND CHILDREN, OVER JOHN


...as he enters with present. RUBY and CLARY are standing 

aside; MARY and PEARL hold up a third pot-holder.


RACHEL COOPER

And did you two make this together?


Both nod.


MARY

You hop us, some.


CLOSE SHOT -- RACHEL, ACCEPTING JOHN'S GIFT


She opens it.


RACHEL COOPER

(quietly)

John, that's the richest gift a body 

could have.

(continued, briskly)

You'll find your presents in the 

cupboard under the china-closet.


GROUP SHOT -- RACHEL AND CHILDREN


RACHEL COOPER

You know where, Ruby.


All turn and run through door except Ruby, whom RACHEL 

detains.


RACHEL COOPER

Ruby:

(she takes a box from 

her apron pocket)

This is yours.


RUBY opens it quickly; it is a cheap costume-jewelry flower-

spray. RUBY and RACHEL kiss like grown women and RUBY goes 

to join the others.


FULL SHOT -- RACHEL


She turns to her stove and is framed by Christmas garland in 

b.g.; banging pots about and stirring; praying as she works, 

which is the best way to pray.


Appropriate noise, o.s., of opening presents.


RACHEL COOPER

Lord save little children!

(bang)

You'd think the world would be ashamed 

to name such a day as Christmas for 

one of them...

(bang)

...and go on the same old way.

(she starts stirring)

My soul is humble when I see the way 

little ones accept their lot.

(she pauses in stirring)

Lord save little children! The wind 

blows and the rain is cold. Yet, 

they abide.


In BACKGROUND, the girls run upstairs, their new dresses 

over their arms. RACHEL glances over her shoulder.


MEDIUM SHOT -- JOHN -- RACHEL'S VIEWPOINT


JOHN stands in next room, looking at something in his hand.


CLOSE SHOT -- JOHN -- IN OTHER ROOM


We see he holds a watch. He looks like any boy, rich or poor, 

with his first watch.


HEAD CLOSE-UP -- RACHEL


RACHEL COOPER

(whispering, so that 

he does not hear)

For every child, rich or poor there's 

a time of running through a dark 

place; and there's no word for a 

child's fear. A child sees a shadow 

on the wall, and sees a Tiger. And 

the old ones say, "There's no tiger; 

go to sleep." And when that child 

sleeps, it's a Tiger's sleep, and a 

Tiger's night, and a Tiger's breathing 

on the windowpane. Lord save little 

children!


JOHN enters boldly behind her and, with a scrape, masterfully 

swings a chair around close to her and straddles it. RACHEL 

turns her back to us. She expects him to speak, he doesn't, 

so she fills in:


RACHEL COOPER

That watch sure is a fine, loud 

ticker!


JOHN gives her a burning, proud smile.


RACHEL COOPER

It'll be nice to have someone around 

the house who can give me the right 

time of day.


JOHN finds his tongue.


JOHN HARPER

This watch is the nicest watch I 

ever had.


RACHEL COOPER

A feller can't just go around with 

run-down, busted watches.


She turns back, face to us, and goes on with her stirring. 

JOHN goes off towards the staircase to join the girls; then 

turns back.


CLOSE SHOT -- JOHN


JOHN HARPER

I ain't afraid no more! I got a watch 

that ticks! I got a watch that shines 

in the dark!


He turns and hurries to the stairs.


HEAD CLOSE-UP -- RACHEL


Over the sound of his running upstairs:


RACHEL COOPER

(telling us)

They abide and they endure.

FULL SHOT -- STARRY SKY
