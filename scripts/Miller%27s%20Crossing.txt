MILLER'S CROSSING


An original screenplay by


Joel Coen


And


Ethan Coen


FADE IN


CLOSE SHOT - A WHISKEY TUMBLER


That sits on an oak side bar under a glowing green bankers 

lamp, as two ice cubes are dropped in.  From elsewhere in 

the room:


MAN

(off)

I'm talkin' about friendship.  I'm 

talkin' about character.  I'm talkin' 

about--hell, Leo, I ain't embarrassed 

to use the word--I'm talkin' about 

ethics.


Whiskey is poured into the tumbler, filling it almost to the 

rim, as the offscreen man continues.


MAN

...You know I'm a sporting man.  I 

like to make the occasional bet.  

But I ain't that sporting.


THE SPEAKER


A balding middle-aged man with a round, open face.


He still wears his overcoat and sits in a leather chair in 

the dark room, illuminated by the offscreen glow of a desk 

lamp.  This is Johnny Caspar.


Behind him stands another man, harder looking, wearing an 

overcoat and hat and holding another hat--presumably Caspar's.  

This is Bluepoint Vance.


CASPAR

When I fix a fight, say--if I pay a 

three-to-one favorite to throw a 

goddamn fight--I figure I got a right 

to expect that fight to go off at 

three- to-one.  But every time I lay 

a bet with this sonofabitch Bernie 

Bernheim, before I know it the odds 

is even up--or worse, I'm betting 

the short money...


Behind Caspar we hear the clink of ice in the tumbler and a 

figure emerges from the shadows, walking away from the glowing 

bar in the background.


CASPAR

...The sheeny knows I like sure 

things.  He's selling the information 

I fixed the fight.  Out-of-town money 

comes pourin' in.  The odds go 

straight to hell.  I don't know who 

he's sellin' it to, maybe the Los 

Angeles combine, I don't know.  The 

point is, Bernie ain't satisfied 

with the honest dollar he can make 

off the vig.  He ain't satisfied 

with the business I do on his book.  

He's sellin' tips on how I bet, and 

that means part of the payoff that 

should be ridin' on my hip is ridin' 

on someone else's.  So back we go to 

these questions--friendship, 

character, ethics.


The man with the whiskey glass has just passed the camera 

and we cut to the:


REVERSE


Another well dressed, middle aged man, behind a large polished 

oak desk, listening intently.


This is Leo.


He is short but powerfully built, with the face of a man who 

has seen things.


The man with the whiskey enters frame and passes Leo to lean 

against the wall behind him, where he listens quietly.


CASPAR

...So its clear what I'm sayin'?


LEO

Clear as mud.


Caspar purses his lips but continues unfazed.


CASPAR

It's a wrong situation.  It's gettin' 

so a businessman can't expect no 

return from a fixed fight.  Now if 

you can't trust a fix, what can you 

trust?  For a good return you gotta 

go bettin' on chance, and then you're 

back with anarchy.  Right back inna 

jungle.  On account of the breakdown 

of ethics.  That's why ethics is 

important.  It's the grease makes us 

get along, what separates us from 

the animals, beasts a burden, beasts 

a prey.  Ethics.  Whereas Bernie 

Bernheim is a horse of a different 

color ethics- wise.  As in, he ain't 

got any.  He's stealin' from me plain 

and simple.


Leo leans back in his chair.


The man behind Leo raises the whiskey glass to his lips.


He is trimmer and younger than Leo, perhaps in his thirties, 

dark-complected, with a pencil mustache and a gaunt intensity 

that is not entirely healthy-looking.


This is Tom.


As he drinks, he studies Caspar and Bluepoint.


LEO

You sure it's Bernie, selling you 

out?


For the first time the man behind Caspar speaks:


BLUEPOINT

It ain't elves.


LEO

Nobody else knows about the fix?


CASPAR

No one that ain't got ethics.


LEO

What about the fighters you pay to 

tank out?


BLUEPOINT

We only pick fighters we can put the 

fear of God in.


LEO

Any other bookies know?  You play 

anyone else's book?


CASPAR

I lay an occasional bet with Mink 

Larouie.


BLUEPOINT

But it ain't Mink, I'll vouch for 

that.


LEO

How do you know?


Caspar shakes his head.


CASPAR

It ain't Mink.  Mink is Bluepoint's 

boy.


LEO

Mm.  And of course, Bluepoint always 

knows about the fix.


BLUEPOINT

What the hell is that supposed to 

mean?


LEO

Let it drift.  All it means is a lot 

of people know.


CASPAR

I guess you ain't been listening.  

Sure other people know.  That's why 

we gotta go to this question of 

character, determine just who exactly 

is chiseling in an my fix.  And that's 

how we know it's Bernie Bernheim.  

The Motzah Kid. 'Cause ethically, 

he's kinda shaky.


LEO

You know Bernie's chiseling you 

because he's a chiseler.  And you 

know he's a chiseler because he's 

chiseling you.


Airily:


CASPAR

Sometimes you just know.


LEO

...So you wanna kill him.


BLUEPOINT

For starters.


Leo nods, thinking.  He swivels to look interrogatively at 

Tom.


Tom gives an almost imperceptible shrug.  The ice cubes in 

his glass clink.


Leo turns back to Caspar, pauses.


LEO

...Sorry, Caspar.  Bernie pays me 

for protection.


Tom, peering over his drink, does not entirely conceal his 

surprise.


Caspar stares at Leo, his mouth open.  It is not the response 

he expected.


CASPAR

...Listen, Leo, I ain't askin, for 

permission.  I'm tellin' you as a 

courtesy.  I need to do this thing, 

so it's gonna get done.


LEO

Then I'm telling you as a courtesy 

that you'll have trouble.  You came 

here to see if I'd kick if you killed 

Bernie.  Well there's your answer.


Caspar's voice is harder:


CASPAR

Listen Leo, I pay off to you every 

month like a greengrocer--a lot more 

than the Motzah--and I'm sick a 

gettin' the high hat--


LEO

You pay off for protection, just 

like everyone else.  Far as I know--

and what I don't know in this town 

ain't worth knowing--the cops haven't 

closed any of your dives and the 

D.A. hasn't touched any of your 

rackets.  You haven't bought any 

license to kill bookies and today I 

ain't selling any.  Now take your 

flunky and dangle.


Caspar is staring at Leo.  He looks at Tom, then rises slowly 

to his feet.


Back at Leo:


CASPAR

Ya know I'm tryin'...I'm tryin' not 

to raise my voice in anger.  I've 

always gone along to get along.  But 

you make me lay off the Matzoh and 

you're givin' me the needle.  I told 

you the sheeny was robbin' me blind, 

I told you I wanna put him in the 

ground and I'm telling you now I'm 

sick a the high hat.


He swipes his hat from Bluepoint.


CASPAR

...You think I'm some guinea fresh 

off the boat and you think you can 

kick me.  But I'm too big for that 

now.


He puts his hands on the desk and leans towards Leo.  The 

cords stand out on his neck.


CASPAR

I'm sick-of takin' the strap from 

you, Leo.  I'm sick a marchin' down 

to this goddamn office to kiss your 

Irish ass and I'M SICK A THE HIGH 

HAT!


Caspar stops, out of breath.  He is red faced and panting.  


Bluepoint has put a gently restraining hand an his shoulder.


Leo and Tom stare at Caspar impassively.


After a beat Caspar shuts his mouth.  His eyes lose some of 

their glaze.  He looks at Bluepoint's hand, turns and strides 

towards the door.


CASPAR

...Youse fuckin' fancy-pants, all of 

ya.


He opens the door, but Leo's voice stops him.


LEO

(softly)

Johnny.  You're exactly as big as I 

let you be and no bigger and don't 

forget it.  Ever.


Caspar looks at Leo from the open doorway.


After a beat he chuckles.


CASPAR

At's right, Leo, you're the big-shot 

around here.


He dances over at Tom again, then back to Leo:


CASPAR

...And I'm just some schnook likes 

to get slapped around.


He leaves, Bluepoint following, shutting the door.


After a beat Tom crosses in front of the desk and sits down 

in the chair Caspar has just vacated.


Leo chuckles and leans back in his chair.


LEO

Twist a pig's ear.  Watch him squeal.


Tom swallows the last of his drink and stares ruminatively 

down at his glass.


TOM

...Bad play, Leo.


Leo, unfazed, grins at Tom.


LEO

Got up on the wrong side, huh?


TOM

Same side as always.


LEO

That's what I mean.  Still owe money 

to--who's your bookie?  Lazarre?


TOM

Mm.


LEO

I could put it right for you.


TOM

Thanks Leo, I don't need it.


LEO

In a pig's eye.  You haven't played 

a winner in six weeks.  People'll 

speak ill of me if I let him break 

your legs.


Tom grins back, for the first time.


TOM

People'll say I had it coming.


LEO

And they'll be right, but that ain't 

the point.  Call me a big-hearted 

slob, but I'm gonna square it for 

ya.


He picks up a phone on his desk and starts to dial.


LEO

...Yeah, I think I'll do that, this 

very same night.  Looking at you 

moping around takes away all my... 

What did you call it?  Joy de veever.


Tom stands and walks over to the desk.


TOM

Joi de vivre.


He takes the receiver from Leo and prongs the phone.


LEO

Well look, if your gonna laugh at 

me, the hell with you.


Tom walks to the door, putting an his hat.


TOM

And with you.  I'll square myself 

with Lazarre if you don't mind.  

That's why God invented cards.


He pauses in the doorway and turns back to Leo.


TOM

...There is something you can do for 

me.


LEO

Name it.


TOM

Think about what protecting Bernie 

gets us.  Think about what offending 

Caspar loses us.


Leo chuckles good-naturedly.


LEO

Come on, Tommy, you know I don't 

like to think.


Tom has stepped into the hallway and, just as he closes the 

door:


TOM

Yeah.  Well, think about whether you 

should start.


The door clicks shut.


CUT TO BLACK


FADE IN 


THE WOODS - CREDIT SEQUENCE


Although it is day, the tree cover gives an effect of almost 

cathedral-like darkness.  The sun filters down through the 

leaves in gently shifting patterns.


We hear only the sound of the wind and the creaking and 

groaning of tree limbs in the breeze.


Head titles are supered over the dissolving series of woods 

scenes.


In the last woods scene the angle is low--almost ground- 

level.  The sun dapples the floor of the forest, which is 

carpeted with pine needles.


With a whoosh of rustling leaves the wind gusts a fedora 

into frame.  For a moment it lies still in the foreground, 

sunlight rippling over it, making it seem almost alive.  

Then the wind picks up again and the hat tumbles away from 

us, end over end, in slow motion into the background, 

impossibly far away until... it disappears.


As we fade out, we hear a distant knocking.


FADE IN


CLOSE SHOT - TOM


Unshaven, eyes closed, motionless.


The head credits continue over this one-shot scene.


The knocking continues, faintly, offscreen.  As we hear a 

door opening we pull back to a looser shot, revealing that 

Tom is slumped back on a tired green sofa.


A fat hand enters to shake Tom's shoulder.


VOICE

Wake up, Tommy.


Without opening his eyes:


TOM

I'm awake.


VOICE

You're eyes were shut.


TOM

Who're you gonna believe?


Tom sits up, though it seems like an effort.  He looks sick.


From a small mirror behind the couch we see that we are in 

the back room of a gambling establishment.  The leavings of 

a card game litter a table in the middle background.


TOM

...How'd I do?


VOICE

What do you think.  You're a 

millionaire.  You gonna remember 

your friends?


Tom reaches up to feel his head, and looks stupidly about.


TOM

...Where's my hat?


VOICE

You bet it, ya moron.  Good thing 

the game broke up before you bet 

your shorts.


After a beat of staring at nothing in particular, Tom abruptly 

lurches to his feet and staggers out of frame.


The other man sits heavily onto the couch that Tom has just 

vacated.  He is Fat Tony, a big man wearing an apron.


He watches as we hear Tom, offscreen, staggering across the 

room, bumping into something which scrapes and then clatters 

over, opening a door, staggering across tile, and then 

vomiting.


Fat Tony watches with mild interest.


Finally:


TOM

...Who left with my hat?


TONY

Verna.  Verna and Mink.


TOM

...Who?


Louder:


TONY

Mink and Verna.


Offscreen we hear a tap running.


TOM

...Thunderclap running tonight?


TONY

Yeah.


TOM

What's she leave at?


TONY

Three-to-one, more'n likely.  Lay 

off, Tom.  You shouldn't go deeper 

in the hole.


TOM

Tell Lazarre I want five hundred on 

the nose.


Tony shrugs.


TONY

You would have it.


TOM

...Somebody hit me?


TONY

Yeah.  Mink hit you.


TOM

...Whyzat?


Tony inspects a hangnail on his thumb.


TONY

You asked him to.


CUT TO


A HALLWAY


A loose shot looking over Tom's shoulder as he knocks on an 

apartment door.  Head credits continue.


The door swings open and Verna, an attractive but hard- 

looking woman in her late twenties or early thirties looks 

coldly out at Tom.


TOM

(still slightly woozy)

Miss me?


VERNA

You again.  What now?


TOM

I want my hat.


VERNA

...Is that all you came for?


TOM

Yeah.  I want my hat.


VERNA

I won it.  It's mine.


TOM

What're you gonna do with it?


VERNA

Drop dead.


She slams the door.


There is a long, motionless beat.


Tom raises his hand and knocks again, missing the door 

completely on his first try.


After a knock or two the door swings open again.


TOM

I need a drink.


VERNA

Why didn't you say so.


She steps away from the door and Tom enters the apartment.


As the door clicks shut we cut to black, and the last of the 

movie's head credits.


Music plays under the credits, mixed in with the woods sounds 

we heard earlier.  As the last of the credits is fading to 

black we hear a distant knocking, and from black we:


CUT TO:


CLOSE SHOT - A FEDORA


Lying on a marble bureau top in a dark room.  A gently 

rippling cookie plays over it--light from a streetlamp thrown 

through a curtained window.


Reflected in the bureau mirror behind the fedora we see the 

soft glow of a burning cigarette.


REVERSE


Tracking in on Tom, sitting in bed, smoking, staring at the 

bureau.


The rippling street light plays over him from the window.  


We hear a distant knocking.


WIDER


The bedroom, as Tom swings his legs around and gets out of 

bed.


Tom throws on a dressing gown and leaves the bedroom through 

its double oak pocket doors, closing the doors behind him.


LIVING ROOM


Also dark, lit only by streetlight filtering in.


The knocking is louder here.


Tom crosses the room, silhouetted against the windows, to 

the apartment's front door.  Light fans in as he opens it.


Shifting uncomfortably in the hallway is Leo, in an overcoat 

and fedora.


LEO

'Lo, Tommy.  Sorry about the hour.


TOM

I'll live.  What's the rumpus?


LEO

Can I come in?


Tom thinks about this for the slightest beat.


TOM

Sure.


He lets Leo precede him into the living room.


Tom turns on a lamp that sits on a rolling bar.


TOM

...Drink?


LEO

I wouldn't mind... I tried calling 

earlier.


TOM

I got home late.


As Tom sits down facing Leo with two drinks:


LEO

Well... Sorry about the hour.


TOM

Uh-huh.


He waits, with no apparent impatience.


The older man is uncomfortable; he is having trouble finding 

the words.


Finally he lifts his glass and swallows it in one gulp.


LEO

...Not bad...


TOM

Better than the paint we sell at the 

club.


LEO

That it is... That it is...


TOM

Thought about cutting Bernie loose?


Leo is shuffling his hat nervously from hand to hand.


LEO

Can't do it, Tommy, can't do it... 

That's sort of why I'm... Tommy... I 

don't know where Verna is.


Tom fixes him with a level stare, then takes a sip of his 

drink.


TOM

Uh-huh.


LEO

I know what you're thinking:  What 

else is new?  But the situation now, 

I'm worried...


Tom blows out air.


TOM

Verna can take care of herself.  

Maybe better than you can.


LEO

What does that mean?


Tom stands up, takes Leo's glass and walks back over to the 

bar.


TOM

Want another?


LEO

No.  What does that mean?


Tom turns to look at Leo, pauses, then decides to speak:


TOM

How far has she got her hooks into 

you?


LEO

That's a hell of a question.


TOM

It's a grift, Leo.  If she didn't 

need you to protect her brother from 

Johnny Caspar, d'you think she'd 

still go with you on slow carriage 

rides through the park?  That is the 

deal, isn't it?  You keep Bernie 

under wraps 'till Caspar cools down?


LEO

Jesus but you're a prickly pear.  

What's wrong with her wanting her 

brother taken care of?


TOM

Not a thing.  I don't blame her.  

She sees the angle--which is you--

and she plays it.  She's a grifter, 

just like her brother.  They probably 

had grifter parents and grifter 

grandparents and someday they'll 

each spawn little grifter kids--


LEO

Stop it, Tommy.  I don't like to 

hear my friends run down.  Even by 

other friends.


Tom shrugs.


TOM

Friendship's got nothing to do with 

it.


LEO

The hell you say.  You do anything 

to help your friends.  Just like you 

do anything to kick your enemies.


TOM

Wrong, Leo.  You do things for a 

reason.


LEO

Okay, Tom, you know the angles--

Christ, better than anybody.  But 

you're wrong about this.  You don't 

know what's in Verna's heart...


Tom stares down into his drink.  There is an awkward pause.  

Then finally, without looking up:


TOM

Leo, throw her down.  And her brother, 

too. Dump her.


Leo looks like he has just been stepped on.


LEO

Jesus, Tom... Verna's okay...


He nods to himself.


LEO

She's a little wild, but she's okay.  

I like her.


Tom smiles.


TOM

Yeah, you like her.  Like the Kaiser 

likes cabbage.  You're dizzy for 

her.


Leo scowls at Tom.


LEO

What of it?  Jesus, Tom, ain't you 

ever been bit by that bug?


TOM

Leo, if she's such an angel, why are 

you looking for her at four in the 

morning?


Leo digs his hands into his pockets and slouches back, 

profoundly embarrassed.


LEO

I put a tail on her this afternoon.


TOM

Hah!


LEO

Yeah, I asked Rug Daniels to follow 

her around--just, you know, just to 

keep her out of trouble.


TOM

And to tell you what trouble she was 

managing to whip up herself.


LEO

It wasn't to spy, Tom; I was worried.  

After that meeting with Caspar, well--

you can't be too careful.


TOM

Uh-huh.  And what did Rug tell you 

that has you scurrying over here?


LEO

That's just it.  Nothing.  He's 

disappeared.


Tom laughs humorlessly.


TOM

So you've lost your ladyfriend and 

the tail you put an her.


LEO

I guess it does sound pretty sorry 

at that...


He looks from his empty glass up to Tom.


LEO

...Help me out, Tom.  I wouldn't 

know where to start looking.  You 

know Rug's crowd, you know the people 

Verna runs with.  I'm just worried 

now, with things the way they are 

between me and Caspar--


Tom gives a wave of disgust.


TOM

You shouldn't be confronting Johnny 

Caspar, it's what I've been trying 

to tell you.  You can't trade body 

blows with him.  He's gotten too 

strong.


For the first time Leo displays some testiness:


LEO

I reckon I can still trade body blows 

with any man in this town...


He sighs, looks back down at his drink.


LEO

...Except you, Tom.


TOM

And Verna.


Leo smiles good-naturedly.


LEO

Okay, give me the needle.  I am a 

sap, I deserve it...


He stands and walks to the door.


Tom doesn't move.  His eyes remain fixed on the chair Leo 

has just vacated.


Leo pauses in the open doorway.


LEO

...Thanks for the drink.  Let me 

know if you hear anything...


The door closes and he is gone.


Tom grimaces and stands up.


Sunlight is just starting to come in through the windows, 

defining for the first time the corners of the large semi-

circular room as Tom walks across it to the bedroom.


Distant early-morning traffic noise is filtering up from the 

street.


INT. BEDROOM


As Tom opens the double oak doors and enters, leaving them 

open.


He crosses to the bed and sits an its edge, hunched forward, 

thinking.  Behind him, a woman stirs.


WOMAN

(sleepily)

Who was that?


TOM

Leo...


He takes a cigarette from the nightstand and lights it.


TOM

...He's looking for you.


Verna stiffens.


VERNA

Did you tell him I was here?


TOM

No.


Verna relaxes.


VERNA

Did you put in a good word for my 

brother?


TOM

No.


VERNA

You said you would.


TOM

...I said I'd think about it.


VERNA

What did you tell him?


Tom is lost in thought.  He exhales smoke.


TOM

...Did you see Rug Daniels last night?


VERNA

No.  What did you tell Leo?


Tom finally turns to face her.  After looking at her for a 

beat:


TOM

...I told him you were a tramp and 

he should dump you.


A shoe flies past his head and hits the wall behind him.


VERNA

You're a son of a bitch, Tom.


EXT. ALLEYWAY - EARLY MORNING


We are on an extreme close shot of a small dog.  Behind him, 

in the distance, we can see the mouth of the alley.


The dog is on point, perfectly still, one front leg crooked 

and raised off the ground, his ears pointed straight up, his 

eyes in a fixed stare.


A MAN


is slouched, half-sitting, against the wall of the alley.  

He is motionless.  His mouth is agape.  His eyes are rolled 

up in a lifeless stare.


He is wearing an overcoat but it is unbuttoned and reveals a 

blood stain in the middle of his chest.  His fedora lies on 

the ground near one of his splayed hands.


There is something subtly odd about his hair.


CLOSE SHOT A LITTLE BOY


Perhaps five years old.  He stares down at the dead man in 

front of him.


CLOSE SHOT THE MAN


Staring vacantly.


THE BOY


After a moment, he reaches forward.


THE MAN


As the boy's hand enters frame.  The boy pokes once at the 

man's shoulder.


There is no reaction.


The boy touches the top of the man's head.


The man's hair slips forward a couple of inches over over 

his forehead.


THE BOY


Staring.


THE MAN


Also staring, his skewed hairpiece ill becoming his stunned 

expression.


The boy reaches forward and takes the hairpiece off the man's 

head.  Now a bald man stares off into space, still looking 

stunned, still quite dead.


WIDE SHOT THE ALLEY


The dead man and the little boy face each other in profile 

in the middle foreground.  In the background, between them, 

the little boy's dog faces us, still on point, still whining.


The little boy is fascinated by the hairpiece he holds.  He 

turns it over and around, and looks from it to the dead man.


Suddenly the boy turns and runs, away from us, towards the 

mouth of the alley, still clutching the hairpiece.


As he passes the dog it turns and runs after him, wagging 

its tail, happy to be leaving.


FADE OUT


FADE IN


INT. DINER - EVENING


A man sits facing us at the counter in the foreground.  His 

face is hidden by the newspaper he is reading.


The page of the newspaper being presented to the camera bears 

a story headlined:


GANGSTER SLAIN.  The subhead: Politician's "Aide" Found Dead 

in Alley.


After a beat the diner drops the paper to the counter, and 

we see that it is Tom, wearing overcoat and hat.  He is 

grimacing at whatever he was reading.  He stands and digs 

into his pocket.


REVERSE


Looking down at the newspaper an the counter, next to a 

steaming cup of coffee.  Tom's hand enters to put some change 

on the counter, leaves, and we hear his receding footsteps.


The headlined story on the page Tom was reading is: 

THUNDERCLAP INJURED IN RACING MISHAP.


CUT TO


TRACKING IN TO CLOSE SHOT PLAQUE


Set into the brick of a building's exterior, it reads: 

SHENANDOAH CLUB.  In script underneath: Members Only.


INT. THE CLUB - NIGHT


Tracking towards the front door as Tom enters.  He puts his 

coat and hat on the check counter.


TOM

Hello, Beryl--


Her arm sweeps across frame to slap Tom hard.


CHECK GIRL

(off)

Ain't you got a conscience?


Tom stares dumbly.


ON BERYL


A diminutive woman in a french maid's uniform with a pill 

box hat.  She rocks her weight on one leg with her hands 

proceed defiantly on her hips.


BERYL

...It's a little voice inside that 

tells you when you been a heel!


TOM

Mine's been mum lately--what'd I do?


BERYL

Stood me up is all.  Made me wait an 

hour and a half is all?  Or maybe 

you don't remember sayin' you'd pick 

me up after work last night.  I seen 

heels in my time, sure, plenty of 

'em!  But none so low as couldn't 

tell me to my face when they was 

sick of me!...


She throws a check number at him.


BERYL

...You know where you can stick it!


CUT TO


TRACKING SHOT


Pulling Tom as he walks across the gambling floor.  He is 

joined by a nervous young man in a tuxedo.


MINK

'Lo Tom.  What's the rumpus?


TOM

Mink.


Mink throws a glance back in the direction of the coat check.


MINK

...I see you got your hat back.


TOM

Yeah, what of it.


MINK

Not a thing, Tommy.  I got not a 

thing to say.  Listen, Bernie wants 

to see you.  It's important.


TOM

Well I'm right here, and I'm not 

made of glass.


MINK

Yeah, but he's nervous walkin' around 

in public.  He's a right guy, but 

he's nervous, Tommy!  He's very 

nervous!  Who wouldn't be?!


Tom looks at Mink for the first time.


TOM

Mink--


MINK

The spot he's in, who wouldn't be!  

He asked me to ask you to ask Leo to 

take care of him.  You know, put in 

a good word with Leo.  Leo listens 

to you.  Not that Leo wouldn't help 

the Motzah anyway!  A guy like Bernie?  

A square gee like the Motzah!  A 

straight shooter like him?


TOM

I don't get it, Mink--


MINK

What's to get?!  It's as plain as 

the nose--


TOM

I thought you were Bluepoint's 

sycophant.


MINK

Yeah Tom, that's right.  But a guy 

can have more than one friend, can't 

he?  Not that I'd want Bluepoint to 

know about it, but a square gee like 

the Motzah?  He's a right guy, Tom!  

He's a straight shooter!  I know 

he's got a mixed reputation, but for 

a sheeny he's got a lot a good 

qualities!


Tom has reached the foot of a large staircase.  He turns to 

look at Mink with mild curiosity.


TOM

Why should I care what happens to 

Bernie?


MINK

C'mon Tom, you like Bernie dontcha?


TOM

I don't like anybody, Mink, you know 

that.


MINK

Well, you like his sister.


TOM

What's that supposed to mean?


MINK

Nothing, Tom.  If it ain't my business 

I got not a thing to say.


Tom studies Mink for a beat.


TOM

What's going an between you and 

Bernie?


MINK

Nothin, Tom!  We're just friends--

you know, amigos?


He sucks on his cigarette and looks nervously around the 

floor, then back at Tom, who stares coolly back.


TOM

You're a fickle boy, Mink.  If 

Bluepoint found out you had another 

"amigo"--well, I don't peg him for 

the understanding type.


Mink is startled.  In a high shrill voice, as Tom walks up 

the stairs, clutching his drink:


MINK

Find out!?  How would he find out?!  

Damnit Tom, me and you ain't even 

been talking!  Jesus Tom, damnit, 

Jesus!


INT. LEO'S OFFICE


Pulling Tom as he enters the office.


LEO

(Off)

'Lo, Tom.  You know O'Gar...


REVERSE


Leo faces us from behind his desk.


Seated in two chairs facing the desk, twisting around to 

greet Tom, are two men.  O'Gar is a large man wearing a police 

uniform.  Dale Levander wears a suit; a florid man with a 

shock of white hair, in his mid-sixties.


LEO

...and the mayor.


TOM

I ought to.  I voted for him six 

times last May.


Levander chuckles.


LEVANDER

And that ain't the record, either.


Tom is crossing to the bar.


LEO

Verna turned up.  She's downstairs.


Tom, his back to Leo as he pours a drink, stiffens.


TOM

...She say where she'd been?


LEO

No, I uh... didn't want to press 

her.  Hear about Rug?


Drink in hand, Tom turns and crosses to perch an a corner of 

Leo's desk.


TOM

Yeah, R.I.P.


LEO

They took his hair, Tommy.  Jesus 

that's strange.  Why would they do 

that?


TOM

Maybe it was Injuns.


LEO

Eye-ties, more like it.  Giovanni 

Casparro.


TOM

So you figure it was Caspar bumped 

Rug?


Leo, with a puzzled smile, glances at O'Gar and the mayor, 

and then back at Tom.


LEO

...Well it's pretty obvious ain't 

it?


TOM

Mm... So what's the plan?


LEO

Jump on the guinea hard.  With both 

feet.


He looks at the mayor who shifts uncomfortably in his seat.


LEO

...Give him the low-down, Dale.


MAYOR

Yes, well... Leo here has just 

reminded us that Mr. Caspar operates 

several clubs in our city wherein 

the patrons imbibe of rum and play 

at games of chance.


Morosely:


O'GAR

And we're supposed to stop the party.


TOM

Uh-huh...


Looking at Leo, he jerks his head towards the two men.


TOM

...They don't seem too happy about 

it, Leo.


O'GAR

Naw, it ain't that, Tom.


MAYOR

Jesus, Tom!  We do as we're told!


Tom ignores them.


TOM

Maybe they're right not to like it.  

Stirring up this hornets' nest won't 

be good for anyone.  And it'll mean 

killing.


LEO

Well I'm not thrilled about it either, 

but I can't just lay down to Caspar.


TOM

You could do worse.  You might not 

like it, but giving up Bernie Bernheim 

is a pretty small price to pay for 

peace.  Business is business and a 

war's going to hurt everybody.  Bernie 

plays with fire, he's got to deal 

with the consequences--even if that 

means he gets bumped off.


LEO

Sweet Jesus, Tom, that ain't even 

the point anymore.  Caspar popped 

Rug.  The day I back down from a 

fight, Caspar is welcome to the 

rackets, this town, and my place at 

the table.  I didn't start this thing, 

but--


Tom's voice is sharp:


TOM

You did start it--you and Verna--


The mayor has risen to his feet.


Uncomfortably:


MAYOR

We can dangle, Leo, if you'd prefer.


LEO

Siddown Dale, we're all friends here.


TOM

--and Caspar hasn't broken the rules, 

Bernie has--and you too, by helping 

him.  And if that isn't enough, 

consider that if you make it a war, 

you have more to lose than Caspar.


Leo is getting up from behind the desk and walking over to 

stare out the window.


LEO

Okay, but more to beat him with.  

Jesus, Tom, the two of us've faced 

worse odds.


TOM

But never without reason.  It helps 

to have one.


Leo doesn't reply.  Tom is irritated, but shrugs indifference.


TOM

...Well, it's your call.


He gets to his feet and starts for the door.


TOM

...My opinion use to count for 

something around here, but it's always 

yours to take or leave.


Leo has turned from the window and is striding after Tom, 

gesturing apologetically.


LEO

Aw, c'mon Tommy.  Its not like that...


The door clicks shut.


LEO

...Goddamnit.  Goddamn kid is just 

like a twist.


CUT TO:


FAT TONY


Tending the downstairs bar as Tom stalks over.


TOM

Gimme a stiff one.


TONY

No small talk, huh?  They shoot your 

nag?


Tony has finished pouring a shot of whiskey which Tom 

immediately knocks back.


TOM

If there's any justice.  Verna around?


TONY

She stepped into the ladies, room.  

You got Lazarre's five hundred?


TOM

He'll have to carry me for a few 

days.


Tom is pouring himself another drink.


TONY

He ain't gonna like that.  Couldn't, 

you get it from Leo?


Tom is irritated:


TOM

It's not Leo's debt.  I'll pay my 

own way.


TONY

I admire a man of principle.  Does 

this go on the tab?


Drink in hand, Tom is already walking away.


INT. LADIES' LOUNGE


As Tom bangs through the door, still carelessly holding his 

tumbler of whiskey.  A rogue lock of hair hangs down over 

his forehead.


TOM

Close your eyes, ladies, I'm coming 

through.


REVERSE


The hubbub of female voices evaporates as all turn to look 

at the male intruder.


The lounge's decor is done in various shades of pink.


Some of the women apply make-up facing the large bulb-

encircled mirrors on overstuffed seashell shaped pink chairs.  

Other women sit, smoking, in the banquettes that line the 

other wall.


All react to Tom's entrance with surprise mixed with various 

degrees of outrage, and they hurry to gather their things 

and leave.  The one exception is Verna, who looks at Tom 

with unperturbed distaste.


As he crosses to her seashell chair:


TOM

Who's the warpaint for?


VERNA

Go home and dry out.


TOM

You don't need it for Leo, believe 

me.  He already thinks you're the 

original Miss Jesus.


She glances hurriedly around the lounge, but the last of the 

women are already leaving.


VERNA

...What the hell's the matter with 

you?


TOM

What's the matter with you?  Afraid 

people might get the right idea?


Verna studies him for a beat.


VERNA

Leo's got the right idea.  I like 

him, he's honest and he's got a heart.


Tom weaves a couple of steps closer to her.


TOM

Then its true what they say.  

Opposites attract.


VERNA

Do me a favor and mind your own 

business.


She turns back to the mirror and starts applying her lipstick.  

Tom drops down to face her in the mirror.


TOM

This is my business.  Intimidating 

helpless women is part of what I do.


VERNA

Then find one and intimidate her.


Tom swallows the rest of his drink in one gulp.


TOM

Leo's upstairs getting ready to shoot 

himself in the foot on your account.


VERNA

I don't know what you're talking 

about.


TOM

He's gonna go to the mat for your 

brother.  And it's gonna hurt him.


VERNA

I don't know Leo's business, but 

he's a big boy.


TOM

He used to be.


Verna pauses with the lipstick.  She looks at Tom intently 

but her tone softens.


VERNA

Look.  What do you want, Tom?  You 

want me to pretend I don't care what 

happens to Bernie?  Well I do.  He's 

my brother and I don't want him to 

get hurt.  If Leo wants to help him 

out I'll step out with him, show him 

a good time in return.  There's no 

harm in that.


TOM

There's a name for that kind of 

business arrangement.


VERNA

I'll do what I have to for Bernie 

and there's no reason for you to try 

and queer that.  Regardless of what 

you think of me, Bernie's a decent 

guy.


TOM

A straight shooter, huh?  A square 

gee?


VERNA

Yeah, sneer at him like everyone 

else.  Just because he's different.  

People think he's a degenerate.  

People think he's scum.  Well he's 

not.


TOM

Poor misunderstood Bernie.


Verna swivels around to stare quizzically at Tom.


VERNA

...What is this about?  You want me 

to stop seeing Leo... Why don't you 

just say so?


TOM

I want you to quit spinning Leo in 

circles and pointing him where to 

go.


VERNA

I forgot--that's your job, isn't it?


TOM

I'll do what I have to to protect 

Leo.  I'm asking you--politely, for 

me--to leave him alone.  I don't 

have to ask.  If I told him about 

our little dance last night, your 

pull would dry up pretty fast.


Now Verna is irritated:


VERNA

So would yours.  I don't like being 

threatened.


TOM

I don't like being played for a 

sucker.  That game might work with 

Leo but it won't work with me.


VERNA

You think last night was just more 

campaigning for my brother?


TOM

I can see the angles...


He grabs her by the arm and drags her roughly to her feet.


TOM

...And I know if there was a market 

for little old ladies, you'd have 

Grandma Bernheim first on line.


VERNA

(struggling to get 

out of his grasp)

You're a pathetic rumhead.


TOM

And I love you, Angel.


Tom takes her hat off, tosses it onto the chair, and kisses 

her roughly on the lips.


Verna breaks away and socks him on the jaw.  Tom staggers 

back, upsetting a table of toiletries and landing against a 

banquette.


He throws his empty whiskey glass at Verna.


She ducks and it smashes into the mirror.


They stand staring at each other for a beat, breathing hard.  

Tom has a smear of lipstick near one side of his mouth.


Finally:


VERNA

...I suppose you think you've raised 

hell.


She picks up her stole and heads for the door.


Tom stands staring at her back, swaying, ever so slightly.


TOM

Sister, when I've raised hell you'll 

know it.


CUT TO:


INT. TOM'S APARTMENT


A wide shot, facing the semi-circular windows, the door of 

the apartment behind us.  A large easy chair in the middle 

foreground faces away from us: a smaller chair is at the 

window end of the room, facing us.


At the cut we hear the ringing of the telephone.


Offscreen we can hear the unhurried scrape of a key in the 

lock, then the door opening, then the door closing.


Tom's back enters frame as he strolls into the room and then 

disappears briefly through an open doorway to the right.  We 

hear an icebox door opening and closing, and then Tom reenters 

again, still not reacting to the insistently ringing phone.  

He is now holding a balled-up towel.


He walks over to the facing chair at the window end of the 

room, shrugs off his overcoat, drapes it on the chair, sits, 

crosses his legs, takes off his hat, tosses it onto the 

upraised toes of his crossed leg, tilts his head back, and 

presses the towel against his forehead--apparently it is an 

icepack.


We are beginning to track slowly towards him.


After a beat he takes out a cigarette, lights it, and reaches 

back for the phone that refuses to stop ringing.


TOM

Yeah...


He casually looks forward, just off to one side, at a specific 

point in space.  He does not react to whatever he is hearing.


TOM

...I need a couple days... Because I 

don't have it now...


We are almost in close shot now.  His gaze is still fixed 

and emotionless.


TOM

...Because I say so... What would be 

good enough?... Well, if it'll make 

him feel any better, tell Lazarre he 

can send someone by to break my legs.  

I won't squawk.


He prongs the earpiece, still looking off.  The track has 

stopped in close shot.  He exhales a stream of smoke, then 

after a beat:


TOM

...'Lo, Bernie.


REVERSE


Slouched in a chair, in the corner of the room, facing Tom, 

is Bernie Bernheim.  He is about thirty and wears his overcoat 

and hat and a good-natured smile.  He holds an apple in one 

hand and a paring knife in the other.  The long peel of the 

apple corkscrews down off the knife.


BERNIE

'Lo, Tom.  What's the rumpus?


TOM

C'mon in, make yourself at home.


BERNIE

Yeah, you weren't here so I thought 

I'd do that.  Didn't wanna answer 

the phone, though.  Figured it wasn't 

for me.


TOM

Uh-huh.


After a silent beat, Bernie chuckles.


BERNIE

...I get it, get to the point, huh?  

Okay.  The point is: I'm a good guy.


TOM

I've heard that from a lot of people 

today.


Bernie slices off an apple section and holds it out to Tom, 

who shakes his head.


BERNIE

Good guy, lot of friends--that's the 

way it works.  Maybe if you 

appreciated me a little more, you 

wouldn't be making waves with Leo.


He pops the slice in his mouth.


BERNIE

It's a bad time to be doing that.  I 

mean, right now we're both in a jam.  

I hear you're on a bad streak, short 

of funds, and I've got that psychotic 

guinea mad at me.  Don't ask me why; 

I'm just a small-timer trying to get 

by, like everyone else.  I need help 

from my friends.  Like Leo.  And 

you.


TOM

Leo gets your sister, what're you 

selling me?


BERNIE

C'mon Tom, its not like that at all.  

Wasn't my idea.  She'll sleep with 

anyone, you know that.  She's even 

tried to teach me a thing or two 

about bed artistry.  Can you believe 

that--my own sister!  Some crackpot 

idea about saving me from my 

friends...


Bernie laughs pleasantly.


BERNIE

She's a sick twist all right.  I 

guess some guys like that.


TOM

She speaks highly of you.


Bernie shrugs.


BERNIE

Yeah, well, you stick by your family.  

The point is, I can help you with 

your debts if that would make us 

friends.  My motto is, a guy can't 

have too many.  Big payday Saturday, 

Tom.  You could be in on it.


For the first time, Tom is interested.


TOM

Another fix?  Which fight?


BERNIE

Well that's confidential at the 

moment.  But it doesn't have to stay 

that way.


Tom gives Bernie a speculative eye.


TOM

How d'you know about it?  Caspar 

isn't laying any more bets with you.


BERNIE

Mm.


Tom gives a humorless smile.


TOM

...You must really have Mink jumping 

through hoops.


Bernie is getting to his feet wiping the knife blade on his 

coat.


BERNIE

Like I say, you can't have too many.


He pauses at the open door, looks up and down the hall and 

turns to look at Tom.


BERNIE

...We got a deal?


TOM

...I'll think about it.


On his way out:


BERNIE

I wouldn't want it any other way.


On the click of the door latch we cut to:


STREET DAY


Pulling Tom along the sidewalk.


TOM

Cud...


He is calling out to a short rail-like man lounging against 

a building who joins him as he walks.  Cud has small sharp 

features except for one cheek, which is hugely distended by 

a wad of chewing tobacco.


TOM

...My credit still good with you?


Cud gives a so-so flutter of his hand.


TOM

...Give me a hundred across on Tailor 

Maid in the third tonight.


Cud shakes his head.


CUD

Lazarre won't like it.


TOM

Try fifty across.


Cud shrugs.


CUD

I'll try.  That'll make another one-

fifty you owe him.


TOM

Only if I lose, Cud.


CUD

Tommy, the way you're goin'--horses 

got knees?


TOM

I dunno.  Fetlocks.


CUD

Well the way you're goin', if I was 

a horse I'd be down on my fetlocks 

prayin' you don't bet on me.


Another man, a huge man, has walked up to flank Tom's other 

side.  This is Frankie.


FRANKIE

Drift, small guy.


CUD

Drop dead, ape.


FRANKIE

C'mon Tom, my boss wants to see you.  

He didn't have time to engrave nothin' 

formal.


Cud starts to fade away.


CUD

I'll see you later, Tommy.  I gotta 

go spit.


INT. ROOM


It is a large room with a couple of card tables, straight- 

backed chairs, a ratty sofa--a sparsely furnished card room 

off the main floor of a club.


At the cut we are tracking behind Tom into the room as Frankie 

and Tic-Tac, a small ferret-faced-man, escort him in.


We hear a woman's voice speaking rapid-fire Italian.


Bluepoint is sitting on the couch, wearing his overcoat and 

his hat pushed back an his forehead.


Sitting at one of the card tables is Caspar.  With him is 

his wife, a short, very round Italian woman, and his son, 

Johnny Jr.


Johnny Jr., about five years old, is also very round.  He 

wears a suit with short pants that reveal dimpled knees.


Bluepoint, an the couch, is watching the domestic scene 

without any particular warmth.


CASPAR

Whaddya mean he's eatin' too much?  

Whadduz the goddamn doctor know?


He turns to the little boy.


CASPAR

...What you eat for lunch?


JOHNNY JR.

A hot dog.


CASPAR

Just a hot dog?


The boy shakes his head.


JOHNNY JR.

A hot dog and mustard.


Caspar throws his head back and roars with laughter.


CASPAR

A hot dog with mustard!  A hot dog 

with mustard!  You hear that, 

Bluepoint!  The kids as smart as a 

whip!  Even Uncle Bluepoint thinks 

that's funny.


Bluenpoint's face is a solem mask.


CASPAR

...Whadduz the goddamn doctor know!


Caspar wipes away tears of mirth and digs in his pocket with 

his left hand.  Extending two closed fists towards the boy:


CASPAR

...G'head, which hand is the penny 

in?


The boy touches his right fist.


CASPAR

...Choose again.


The boy just looks at him.


CASPAR

...Okay, here ya go.  Take the penny.  

Shiny new penny.


To his wife.


CASPAR

...Take the kid.  Wait in the car.  

Give'm a penny, boys.


Tic-Tac and Frankie dig in their pockets for change as the 

boy and his mother cross to the door.


FRANKIE

I ain't got a penny, boss.


Caspar has turned his attention to a check book that lies on 

the table in front of him.


As he writes:


CASPAR

Ah, well, that's a penny ya owe him.  

'Lo Tom, what's the rumpus?  You 

like kids?


TOM

No.


Absently:


CASPAR

Uh-huh.  Have a seat.  G'ahead.


He tears out the check.


CASPAR

...Well, you're missin' out on a 

complete life.  I know, kids, big 

deal, but still, I'm tellin' ya.


He blows on the check.


CASPAR

...Anyway... Thanks for comin' by.  

I just wrote this check out to your 

bookmaker, Lazarre.  It's for an 

even fifteen hundred, which is more 

than I hear you owe him but I figure 

you can always use some money on the 

cuff, a high roller such as yaself 

whaddya say?


TOM

...Thanks.


Caspar laughs.


CASPAR

Always the yapper, huh?  Well, you're 

welcome.  You wanna know why I'm 

putting you square with Lazarre?


TOM

Not particularly.


CASPAR

Bad feeling.  It ain't a good thing.  

It's a poison, kid.  I want everybody 

to be friends.  I do this, you're 

friends with Lazarre, he's friends 

with you, and you're friends with 

me.  And all you gotta do, show you're 

a friend, is to give me Bernie 

Bernheim.  You know it's the right 

thing anyway; I can't keep any 

discipline if I can't punish the 

people I need to punish.  The Motzah 

steals from me, I can't have Leo 

givin' him a shiny new penny... You 

find some way to make Leo understand 

that.


TOM

So the deal is, I give you the Motzah, 

smooth it over with Leo, and you 

bail me out with Lazarre.


CASPAR

Yeah, then we're all friends again: 

You, me, Leo, Bluepoint.


Bluepoint sneers from the couch:


BLUEPOINT

We can maybe have tea sometime.


CASPAR

C'mon, Bluepoint.  Friends is a mental 

state.  Wuddya say, kid?


TOM

...I'll think about it.


CASPAR

He'll think about it.  Hear that, 

Bluepoint?  That's terrific.  The 

kid's a thinker.


BLUEPOINT

Does he want a pillow for his head?


CASPAR

Okay kid, think about it.  It's a 

mental state.  But make it quick, my 

family's waitin'.


TOM

I'll think about it and tell you 

later.


BLUEPOINT

He needs to think in the thinking 

room.


Caspar shakes his head sadly.


CASPAR

Kid, if it'll help you think, you 

should know that if you don't do 

this you won't be in any shape to 

walk outa here.


Tom considers this.


TOM

...Would that be physically, or just 

a mental state?


Caspar stares at him for a beat, then slowly starts to tear 

up the check.


CASPAR

...That ain't friendly, kid.  I make 

you a nice offer, I get the high 

hat.


He gets up and walks over to the door.  Tic-Tac opens it for 

him and precedes him out.


Before following Caspar out the door, Bluepoint grins at 

Tom.


BLUEPOINT

Too bad for you, smart guy.


He leaves, shutting the door.


The room is quiet.


Tom looks at Frankie, the large man, who looks back.


Frankie stands, takes off his suit coat, and hangs it 

carefully on a rack by the door.


He approaches Tom.


TOM

Hold it.


Frankie complies.  Tom is standing and shrugging off his 

coat.  He folds it neatly and turns to lay it on the chair 

he was in.


When he turns around again he is holding the chair and he 

smashes it into Frankie's face.


Frankie staggers back but doesn't drop.  He reaches up to 

his nose and his hand comes away bloody.


FRANKIE

...Jesus, Tom.


Tom still holds the chair.


Frankie looks at him for a moment, then walks over to the 

door, opens it, and leaves, shutting it behind him.


The room is very quiet.  Tom stands facing the door, still 

holding the chair.  After a beat or two, he starts to put it 

down.


The door opens and he quickly raises the chair again.


Tic-Tac, the little man with the hawk nose, is striding into 

the room, briskly approaching Tom.  Frankie, the gorilla, 

follows cautiously.


Tic-Tac blocks Ton's swing of the chair with his forearm, 

wraps both arms around it and pulls it away from Tom.  As 

Frankie circles Tom, Tic-Tac tosses the chair across the 

room.


Frankie, now behind Tom, wallops him in the small of the 

back.  The blow sends him staggering towards Tic-Tac, who 

cracks him in the jaw.


Frankie grabs Tom's hair and yanks his head back as Tic-Tac 

works on his midsection.  Tom's hands are reaching back to 

grope for Frankie.


Still holding his hair with one hand, Frankie cuffs Tom 

awkwardly on the side of the head.  Tom staggers around and 

Tic-Atc, now behind him, also hits him on the side of the 

head.


Tom goes down.  His head hits the floor with a thunk.


We are on a low angle an the floor.  Behind Tom's head, in 

the background, we see the door to the room.


The door splinters in with a loud crash.


Frankie's feet are walking up alongside Tom's head, as blue 

uniforms stream into the room.


FRANKIE

Just in the nick of time, huh?


He brings his foot back to deliver a walloping kick to the 

back of Tom's head.  On the impact we cut to:


BLACK


Over black we hear the sound of running water.


FADE IN


TOM


Gasping for air as his head is pulled out from under a running 

faucet.


The uniformed policeman who was holding him there and is now 

pulling him back up, grins at him.


COP

No harm done.  Unless your friend 

broke his foot.


Tom is still woozy.


TOM

...Wuzzit... How long... What day is 

it?


COP

Friday, 12th of September, 1929.  

Same as when you left us, about ten 

seconds ago...


He is leading Tom by the arm out of the cramped bathroom, 

back into the card room where he was beat up.  Another cop 

has Frankie cuffed in a straightbacked chair and is taking 

roundhouse swings at him.  He pauses, breathing heavily.


SECOND COP

...'Lo, Tom.  Care to skin a knuckle 

on your playmate here?


TOM

No... thanks, Delahanty...


As Tom and the first cop leave the card room:


SECOND COP

Well if you change your mind, we'll 

be interrogatin' for a while...


Tom and his escort are emerging onto the casino floor.


FIRST COP

What was that party about, anyway?


TOM

We do this every weekend.


Blue uniforms are everywhere.


Some are escorting tuxedoed patrons and employees to the 

exit; some wield axes on the gaming equipment; others are 

using nightsticks to smash the bottles behind the bar.


Tom winces at this and lights a cigarette.


TOM

Jesus...


He takes a battle and glass from a table as they walk by.


TOM

...What the hell is the matter with 

you people?


FIRST COP

Well, they said make it hurt... So 

we make it hurt.


EXT. THE BUILDING


We see that the building's facade claims to be SABBATINI'S 

ANTIQUES AND COLLECTIBLES.


Tom weaves across the street with his battle and glass towards 

O'Gar, the police chief, leaning against a squad car, chewing 

a toothpick.


He is watching morosely as his men load other men into 

paddywagons; the street is clogged with police vehicles.


TOM

Drink, O'Gar?


O'Gar does not bother to look at Tom as they talk; he is 

unhappily watching the spectacle.


O'GAR

I'm on duty.


Tom pours himself a glass.


TOM

To Volstead...


He tosses back a shot.


TOM

...Any news on Rug?


O'GAR

Still dead, far as I know.


TOM

Get a slug out of him?


O'GAR

Yeah, a .22.  Listen, Tom, I'm just 

the chief around here, so don't bother 

telling me if you don't happen to 

feel like it, but what the hell is 

Leo doing?


TOM

Ours is not to reason why, friend.


O'GAR

Balls.  Look at this mess.  Make him 

listen to you, Tom.  It ain't right, 

all this fuss over one sheeny.  Let 

Caspar have Bernie--Jesus, what's 

one Hebrew more or less?


He nods at the building.


O'GAR

...We're burning our mealticket here.


TOM

Leo'll do what suits him, and you'll 

do what he tells you.  Last I heard 

Leo's still running this town.


O'GAR

He won't be for long if this keeps 

up.  It's no good for anyone--you 

said as much yourself.


TOM

First off, O'Gar, I can say what I 

please to Leo and about him...


He taps him on the chest.


TOM

...You can't.  Second, once Leo 

decides--that's that.  And if that 

sticks going down, there are plenty 

of other coppers wouldn't mind being 

chief, and could swallow it clean.


O'Gar looks chastened.


O'GAR

Jesus, Tom, I was just speculatin' 

about a hypothesis.  I know I don't 

know nothin'.  It's just a damn mess 

is all--


He is interrupted by gunfire from an upper story of the facing 

building.


O'Gar's men react, finding cover, returning the fire.


O'Gar unholsters his gun as he and Tom scramble for cover.


O'GAR

...a goddamn mess.


HALLWAY


We are shooting over Tom's shoulder as he knocks at the door 

to Verna's apartment.


After a beat, Verna opens the door.


On seeing who it is she starts to swing the door shut.


Tom puts his toe in the doorway and leans into the door.


As he pushes his way in:


TOM

Thanks, don't mind if I do.


INT. APARTMENT


As Verna gives up and Tom enters.


Verna walks over to the phone.  As she dials, Tom tosses his 

hat onto a chair and checks the apartment to see if they're 

alone.


VERNA

Hello, officer, I'd like to report 

an intruder at 346 West--


Tom grabs the phone away from her.


TOM

Who's this?... 'Lo, Shad, Tom 

Duchaisne here.  We won't be needing 

any today... That's right, my mother.  

She didn't recognize me.  Lemme talk 

to Mulvaney.


He takes a flask out of his packet and looks across the room 

towards Verna.


TOM

...Miss me?


VERNA

Drop dead.


We hear a voice barking through the line and Tom turns back 

to the phone.


TOM

...'Lo Sean, tell O'Gar to send a 

car over to Leo's tonight.  If we're 

going to be banging away at Caspar 

we ought to be ready for him to bang 

back... Yeah.


He hangs up the phone and tips the flask back, draining the 

last drop.


VERNA

What do you want?


Tom is crossing to the bar.


TOM

I was in the neighborhood, feeling a 

little daffy.  Thought I'd drop in 

for an aperitif.


He pours himself a drink.


TOM

...Rug Daniels is dead.


VERNA

Gee, that's tough.


TOM

Don't get hysterical.  I've had enough 

excitement for one night without a 

dame going all weepy on me.


VERNA

I barely knew the gentleman.


TOM

Rug?  Bit of a shakedown artist.  

Not above the occasional grift, but 

you'd understand that.  All in all 

not a bad guy, if looks, brains and 

personality don't count.


VERNA

You better hope they don't.


He gives her a sick grin.


TOM

...Yeah well, we're none of us the 

saint I hear your brother is.


VERNA

Who killed him?


TOM

Leo thinks Caspar did.


VERNA

But you know better.


TOM

I do now.  Caspar just tried to buy 

me into settling his tiff with Leo, 

which held hardly do if he was waging 

war.  So I figure you killed him, 

Angel.  You or Saint Bernard.


VERNA

Why would I--or my brother--kill Rug 

Daniels or anybody else?


TOM

Rug was following you.  He knew about 

you and me.  That wouldn't help your 

play with Leo, would it?


He looks at her.  She holds his gaze.


VERNA

You think I murdered someone.  Come 

on, Tom, you know me a little.


TOM

Nobody knows anybody--not that well.


VERNA

You know or you wouldn't be here.


TOM

Not at all, sugar.  I came to hear 

your side of the story--how horrible 

Rug was, how he goaded you into it, 

how he tried to shake you down--


VERNA

That's not why you came either.


Tom shrugs.


TOM

Tell me why I came.


Verna looks at him.


VERNA

The oldest reason there is.


TOM

There are friendlier places to drink.


VERNA

Why can't you admit it?


TOM

Admit what?


VERNA

Admit you don't like me seeing Leo 

because you're jealous.  Admit it 

isn't all cool calculation with you--

that you've got a heart--even if 

it's small and feeble and you can't 

remember the last time you used it.


TOM

If I'd known we were going to cast 

our feelings into words I'd have 

memorized the Song of Solomon.


Verna smiles.


VERNA

...Maybe that's why I like you, Tom.  

I've never met anyone made being a 

sonofabitch such a point of pride.


She turns to walk across the room.


VERNA

...Though one day you'll pay a price 

for it.


Tom grabs her wrist.


TOM

Okay, Verna.  But until then, let's 

get stinko.


He draws her close.


VERNA

...Let's do something else first.


She reaches up, takes off his hat, and tosses it casually 

away.  We pan with the hat to where it lands on the floor, 

in front of a curtained window.


TOM

(off)

Yeah.  Let's do plenty.


DISSOLVE THROUGH TO


ANOTHER WINDOW - NIGHT


A living room window, open, its white sheers billowing lazily 

in the draft.


Faintly, from another room in the house, we can hear a 

phonograph playing John McCormack singing "Danny Boy".


At the cut we hear a thump, close by, and briefly the sounds 

of a struggle.  We then hear a breathy, gurgling sound, which 

quickly subsides.


The living room is late-night quiet.


The shot is a lateral track, which brings us off the window 

to an end table in the foreground.  On the end table is a 

pouch of Bull Durham, a package of rolling papers, a cup of 

coffee with steaming rising off of it, and a section of a 

newspaper.  The draft gently lifts a couple rolling papers 

off the table.


The continuing track takes us off the end table and, booming 

down, shows us an upset chair and the legs of the man who 

occupied it.


We track along the man's body to discover that he is face-

down on the section of newspaper he was reading, blood oozing 

out of his slit throat onto the newspaper.


The continuing track shows that, between the fingers of one 

outflung hand, a cigarette burns.  It is resting on the 

newspaper.


We see the feet of another man who is turning and walking 

away from the man on the floor, into the background.  We pan 

over to watch him recede, framing out all of the dying man 

except his outflung hand and cigarette.


As the walking man recedes, more and more of his topcoated 

body crops in.  By the time he reaches the house's front 

door, in the deep background, we can see him full figure.


The newspaper in the foreground is crackling into flame.  

The rug it rests on is beginning to smoke and discolor.


As the man in the background opens the front door we jump 

in:


OVER HIS SHOULDER


Waiting in the darkness just outside is another man in a 

topcoat and fedora.  He is holding two tommy guns.


The men do not exchange words.


The man outside hands his partner a tommy gun and follows 

him as he walks back into the house.


Still faint, we continue to hear "Danny Boy".  We also hear 

the lick of flames.


VICTROLA


The song is louder at the cut.  We are in an upstairs bedroom.


LEO


Stretched out an his bed, wearing a robe over his pajamas, 

smoking a cigar, listening--but only to the phonograph.  Its 

sound covers any other noise in the house.


STAIRWAY


A close track on the two pairs of feet climbing the stairs.  

We see only the feet, the swaying hems of the topcoats and, 

occasionally dipping into frame, the muzzles of the two tommy 

guns.


BEDROOM


Leo, is motionless, looking down, a puzzled expression.


HIS POV


The floor.


Thin smoke is beginning to sift up through the floorboards.


STAIRWAY


Tracking on the approaching feet.  The song grows louder.


BEDROOM


Leo, looking, slowly taking the cigar from his mouth.


BEDROOM DOOR


From inside as--CRASH--it is kicked in.


LEO


Hitting the floor and rolling under the bed.


THE TWO GUNMEN


Striding into the room.


LEO


On his belly under the bed, facing the door, swinging a 

handgun in front of him.


HIS POV


From floor level, the bottom of the mattress above us, the 

floorboards stretching away.


The bed crops the two gunmen mid-shin as they swing their 

guns up, firing.


RAT-TAT-TAT-TAT--the hems of their coats sway as they fire.


The floorboards in front of us are pocked by bullet hits 

that walk across the floor towards the bed and hit the 

mattress.


The mattress above us dances under the gunfire as ticking 

sprays down at the floor.


Smoke curls up through the floorboards.


LEO


Jaw clamped on his cigar, he starts firing.


HIS POV


Blood spurts as one gunman takes a hit in the ankle.


He staggers and his tommy gun clatters to the floor.


LEO


Still firing.


HIS POV


The other gunman is ducking out the door.


The injured gunman pitches forward, head towards us, his hat 

rolling off.


LEO


Firing.


HIS POV


A bullet hit in the top of the fallen man's head.


LEO


Rolling out from under the bed.


He stoops to pick up the dead man's tommy gun.  Thick smoke 

seeps up through the floor.


The phonograph plays.


Leo ducks through another door.


HALLWAY


Facing down the length of the dark hallway, towards the mouth 

of the stairs.


As Leo leaps across frame in the foreground, to enter a facing 

room, muzzle flashes erupt at the end of the hall--where the 

other gunman has been waiting in the darkness.


SECOND ROOM


Leo throws open a window.


EXT.


As Leo rolls out onto the long sloping eave of a front porch.


His gun skates down the eave and falls.  Leo grabs the rain 

gutter, hangs by his hands and drops down to the front lawn.


The first floor of the house is in flames.


From a high angle the camera swoops down on Leo as he picks 

up the gun and backs away from the house, looking up at the 

second story.  His open robe flaps in the breeze.  The dead 

cigar is still clamped between his teeth.


LEO'S POV


The second floor window that he just emerged from. Staccato 

gunfire erupts in the dark room.


The strobing gunfire makes a strobing shadow of the gunman, 

whose back is to us as he rakes the room with fire.


LEO


Firing, the gun jumping and bucking in his hands.


INSIDE THE ROOM


The gunman, riddled with bullets and showered with broken 

glass, spins around, his thompson still firing uncontrol- 

lably.


Bullets dance across the walls and ceiling, blast out the 

remaining glass and sing harmlessly into the trees outside.


BACK TO LEO


As we hear the screech of skidding tires.  A black coupe 

takes a curve on the street behind him, machine gun fire 

spitting out of the back window.


Leo turns, in the glow of the fanning flames, walking calmly 

into the street, firing at the receding car.


ON THE CAR


Growing smaller, still spitting fire and lead.


PULLING LEO


Still walking calmly up the street, the gun still bucking in 

his hands.  Bullets whistle by and claw up the pavement around 

him.


BEHIND LEO


His robe whips back in the breeze.  He fires again and we 

hear the distant sound of shattering glass.  The car weaves, 

runs up off the road, hits a tree and bursts into flame.


A figure emerges from the car and staggers off into the 

darkness.  He is on fire.


CLOSE ON LEO


As he stops, squinting, raising the gun.


HIS POV


The burning gunman zig-zagging into the darkness.


BACK TO LEO


A faint smile curls around the cigar.  He drops the muzzle 

of the gun.


LEO

Huhh...


The shell of the car explodes in a fireball as we:


CUT TO 


UPSTAIRS HALLWAY - SHENANDOAH CLUB


The explosion echoes over the cut as we track up the hallway 

behind Tom and a tall cadaverous man with prematurely white 

hair.  This is Dead Terry McGill.


Gunmen of every description line the hallway, lounging against 

the walls, barely acknowledging the two men.


TOM

Who's winning?


TERRY

We are, for the nonce.


TOM

What's the disposish?


TERRY

Last night?  Four to one.  Dana Cudahy 

went up with the house.


TOM

And theirs?


TERRY

One burned.


TOM

The other three?


TERRY

Lead.


TOM

Whose?


TERRY

Leo's.


He is opening the door to admit Tom.  In a low, gravelly 

voice:


TERRY

...The old man's still an artist 

with a thompson.


INT. LEO'S OFFICE


As Tom enters.


Leo is bellowing into the phone:


LEO

--well find him, goddamnit!  Go see 

if he fell in the john!  And get 

him, over here!


He slams down the phone.


LEO

...Sonofabitch!  No chief!  Who's 

running the goddamned store?


Tom goes to the bar to pour himself a drink.


TOM

Can't raise O'Gar?


LEO

No, nor the mayor either.


TOM

Hmm.


He takes a sip.


TOM

...That's not good.  They're running.


LEO

They wouldn't dare.


TOM

I don't know, Leo.  I warned you not 

to hit Caspar's club--


LEO

I'm still here, ain't I?


TOM

Caspar's play hurt you anyway.


LEO

Hah!  That sorry sonofabitch just 

slit his own throat.  He just made 

me decide to step on him--


TOM

Listen to me Leo.  Last night made 

you look vulnerable.  You don't hold 

elected office in this town.  You 

run it because people think you run 

it.  Once they stop thinking it, you 

stop running it.


LEO

Jesus, Tom, sounds like a bad break 

for me I wasn't killed.


TOM

I mean it, Leo.  Start taking Caspar 

seriously.


LEO

Don't sing me the blues again, Tommy.  

I need your help.  He shoots, we 

gotta answer--


TOM

That's what got you in this mess.


LEO

I know, I know.  Retreat to win.  

Give up Bernie.  That'll solve all 

our problems.


TOM

It won't anymore, I'll grant that.  

Now its either you or Caspar.  But 

going toe-to-toe with a psychopath'll 

get you nowhere.  It'll force everyone 

to choose sides just when you're 

looking shaky.


LEO

The hell I do!


TOM

Then where's the mayor?  Why aren't 

there any police here?  Why weren't 

there police at your place last night?


LEO

I didn't ask for any.


TOM

I did.


Leo chuckles.


LEO

Mother hen, huh?  What's the matter, 

Tommy, you think I can't take care 

of myself?


TOM

I know you can't.  Here's the smart 

play, Leo: you lay back, give up 

Bernie, let Caspar think he's made 

his point.  Wait for him to show you 

a weakness--


LEO

Please, Tom...


Tom stares at him.


TOM

You're sticking on Bernie.  Sticking 

your neck out for a guy who'd chop 

you off at the heels if there was 

two bits in it.


Leo leans back in his chair, puts his feet up, and gazes out 

the window.


LEO

...Tom, it ain't all as clear-cut as 

you make it... Bernie's--Well hell, 

you know about me and Verna... Things 

now are--not that I haven't been a 

gentleman, but... I, uh... I plan to 

ask her to marry me, Tom.


There is a long, awkward silence.  Leo avoids Tom's look but 

finally responds to the silence:


LEO

...I guess you think that's a bonehead 

play.


TOM

Do you think she wants you to?


LEO

How the hell do I know, Tom?...  I 

think she does... Yeah, 'course she 

does.  I know, I know, you think 

different but--well, we just differ 

on that.


TOM

Leo.


Tom takes a deep breath, and exhales.


TOM

...Caspar didn't kill Rug.


Absently:


LEO

Course he did.


TOM

No.  Think about it.  Just this one 

time.  Who was Rug following?


This gets Leo's attention.  He turns to look at Tom.


LEO

...Huh?


TOM

It needn't have been that sinister.  

A strange man, following her down a 

dark alley, late at night... I've 

told you, Leo, she can take care of 

herself.


Leo stares at Tom.  He seems somewhat dazed.


LEO

...Tom, why're you saying that?  

Christ, Tom.  I just told you, I 

plan to...


TOM

They pulled a .22 slug out of him.  

A pop gun, Leo--a woman's gun.


LEO

...That's a whiskey dream.  Verna 

wouldn't panic--shoot someone--just 

because he was following her.


He gazes off again, shaking his head.


LEO

...No... It wouldn't have happened 

that way in the first place, and if 

it had she would have told me... I 

know you don't like her, Tom, but I 

trust Verna as much as I trust you.


TOM

On her account you'll burn the town 

down.


LEO

Don't worry, Tom.  We'll still be 

standing when the smoke clears.


Tom's tone is gentle:


TOM

Okay Leo.  Then maybe it wasn't that 

innocent.  Maybe Rug knew something 

she didn't like him knowing, and 

wouldn't want you to know.  He was 

following her.  He knew who she was 

seeing.  He knew where she was 

sleeping, and who with...


Leo has taken his feet off the sill and has turned back to 

face Tom.  He studies him carefully.


LEO

Maybes don't make it so.


Tom's suddenly very earnest, almost beseeching.


TOM

They're more than maybes.  You've 

trusted me before, and never lost 

anything by it.  Trust me on this.


LEO

This is too important.


TOM

I don't ask much, and I don't ask 

often.  Trust me on this.


LEO

Tommy--


TOM

Trust me on this or the hell with 

you.


LEO

You don't mean that.


TOM

...She was at my place.  The night 

Rug was following her; the night you 

dropped by.


Leo is still staring impassively at Tom.  Tom doesn't flinch 

from his gaze.


After a long beat Leo gets up slowly from his chair, walks 

over to the window, shoves his hands in his pockets and gazes 

out.


For a moment Tom looks at Leo's motionless back, but he has 

nothing left to say.  He rises, plucks his hat from the desk 

and goes to the door.  Before exiting, he looks back.


Leo, in long shot, is still gazing out the window.


Tom exits.


HALLWAY


Pulling Tom up the hall.


Behind him we can see the door to Leo's office opening and 

Leo coming out.  He strides up the hall after Tom.


Tom turns as Leo reaches him.


Leo, without breaking stride, seems to walk right into him, 

throwing a punch that catches Tom on the chin and sends him 

stumbling back, his hat flying off.


The men lining the hall watch with casual interest.


Tom staggers into one of the men who catches him.  Another 

man has picked up Tom's hat and now hands it to him.  The 

first man shoves Tom back into the middle of the hall just 

in time for the approaching Leo to land another punch against 

his jaw.


This blow sends Tom rolling down the staircase, still 

clutching his hat.


Leo is clomping down the stairs; his army of private retainers 

clomp down behind him.  In his shirtsleeves and chomping an 

unlit cigar, Leo looks like a labor leader taking the rank 

and file to the barricades.


Tom claws himself up the wall to his feet.


Leo has reached the floor and still without breaking stride 

uppercuts Tom with a blow that straightens him up and sends 

him staggering like a drunk into gamblers in evening dresses 

and tuxedos.


A path clears for Leo and his entourage.  He has not slackened 

his pace, but is also not hurrying.  Tom weaves, watching 

Leo approach, but makes no attempt to defend himself.


Leo grabs his own wrist with one hand and swings his elbow 

up to catch Tom with a sharp blow on the side of his face.


Tom spins into a screaming lady in a sequined evening dress 

and sinks to the floor grabbing at her bodice and skirt for 

support.  She bats at him with her handbag as he slips down.


Fat Tony emerges from the crowd and helps Tom to his feet.  

He raises his hand to stop Leo.


TONY

Okay, Leo.  I'll throw him out.


Leo stops, panting.  He is looking at Tom, but speaking to 

to Tony.


LEO

...Yeah.  Do that... It's the kiss-

off.  If I never see him again it'll 

be soon enough.


CUT TO


TOM'S APARTMENT


Wide shot of his living room, facing the windows.  It is 

night.


Tom sits with his back to us at the window, feet propped up 

on the sill.  He is smoking a cigarette.  A full ashtray on 

a table at his side indicates that he has been sitting there 

for some time.


We are slowly tracking in.


The telephone sits on the the arm of his chair.  After a 

moment he stubs out the cigarette, picks up the phone and 

dials.


TOM

...'Lo Frankie its Tom, how's the 

flunky business?... I've had worse; 

your ventilator healing up?


Offscreen we hear a knocking at the door to the apartment.  

Tom ignores it.


TOM

...Tell Caspar its already forgotten.  

I'd like to see him...


The knocking continues.


TOM

...All right, do what you have to do 

and let me know.


He cradles the phone, lights another cigarette, takes a drag, 

blows a thoughtful cloud of smoke and turns to face the door.  

After a beat he rises and leaves frame.


THE DOOR


As Tom swings it open.  Verna stands in the hallway outside.  

After a wordless beat she moves past him into the apartment.  

Tom turns and follows her.


He walks over to his bar, pours two drinks, then crosses the 

room to Verna who has seated herself, hands her a drink and 

sits down in a chair facing hers.


VERNA

...It worked, whatever you did; Leo 

told me we're quits.  But you know I 

didn't have anything to do with Rug.


TOM

Maybe not... Anyway, that isn't what 

soured him on you.


The thought is bitter but her tone isn't:


VERNA

Oh, you and me, huh?  You always 

take the long way around to get what 

you want, don't you Tom... You could 

have just asked.


Tom looks at her.


TOM

...What did I want?


Verna returns his look, then answers evenly:


VERNA

Me.


After a beat Tom, his eyes still on Verna, brings the glass 

to his lips and takes a sip.  The ice cubes clink.


FADE OUT


FADE IN


THE BEDROOM


Tom sits perched on the edge of the bed, smoking a ciga- 

rette.  Verna is in bed behind him.  The lamp on the 

nightstand is burning a faint yellow.


The telephone rings.


As Tom reaches for it, Verna stirs behind him.


TOM

Yeah?


He reaches over to switch off the light; when he does the 

room remains illuminated by dull gray light; it is dawn.


TOM

...Yeah yeah, when?... Okay.


He hangs up, and continues to smoke, staring absently off.


VERNA

...You're still up?


Tom answers without turning to face her:


TOM

Yeah.


VERNA

...What're you chewing over?


TOM

...Remembering something...


VERNA

What was it?


Tom turns to look at her, then turns back and looks out the 

window.


TOM

Just a dream.  I was walking in the 

woods, don't know why... The wind 

came up and blew my hat off...


VERNA

And you chased it, right?  You ran 

and ran and finally you caught up to 

it and picked it up but it wasn't a 

hat anymore.  It had changed into 

something else--something wonderful.


TOM

No. It stayed a hat.  And no I didn't 

chase it.  I watched it blow away...


He takes a drag an the cigarette.


TOM

...Nothing more foolish than a man 

chasing his hat.


Tom rouses himself, rises, and we pan to follow as he picks 

up a shirt and starts buttoning it in the bureau mirror.


VERNA

Where're you going?


TOM

Out.


Verna stares at him.


VERNA

...Don't let on more than you have 

to.


Tom shrugs.


TOM

Just have to do a few things.


VERNA

You and Leo might still be able to 

patch things up.


Tom grimaces into the mirror.


TOM

Me and Leo are finished.  Nothing's 

going to change that.


VERNA

You never know.  He's got a big heart.


TOM

We're quits--as far as I'm concerned, 

never mind him.  And if Leo did want 

me back he's an even bigger sap than 

I thought.


VERNA

...Then why don't we just pick up 

and leave town?  There's nothing 

keeping you here.  I know there's 

nothing keeping me.


Tom is starting to knot a tie.


TOM

What about Bernie?


VERNA

He could come with us.


TOM

You, me and Bernie.  Where would we 

go, Verna?  Niagara Falls?


VERNA

Why do you hate him?


TOM

I don't hate anyone.


VERNA

Or like anyone.


TOM

Whatever.  Where is Bernie?


Verna looks at him.


VERNA

Why?


TOM

Leo can't protect him anymore.  I 

ought to tell him to skip.


VERNA

The Royale.  Room three-oh-two.


She gazes off.


VERNA

...I guess we both double-crossed 

Leo, there's no getting around that.  

I guess he's well rid of both of us.


TOM

Mm.


VERNA

The two of us, we're about bad enough 

to deserve each other.


TOM

Are we?


VERNA

We're a couple of heels, Tom.  Yes 

we are.


PULLING TOM


Into a dark office.  Behind him, Frankie, his nose swathed 

with bandages, is closing the door from the outside.


CASPAR

(Off)

'Lo, Kid.  You know O'Gar...


TOM'S POV


Caspar sits behind his desk.  Bluepoint sits slouched on a 

couch to one side, wearing his hat, his hands jammed into 

the pockets of his overcoat.


In two chairs facing the desk, away from us, sit two men who 

are twisting around to smile at Tom.


CASPAR

...and the mayor.


TOM

'Lo, boys.


MAYOR

Tom's a big booster.  Always has 

been.


CASPAR

S'fine, s'fine.  Well, Tom and me's 

got the proverbial fat to chew--


The mayor and O'Gar are already rising to their feet.


MAYOR

Well, let us know if you need 

anything. . .


CASPAR

Yeah, happy days.  Have a seat, kid...


Tom sits into one of the vacated chairs facing Caspar.


CASPAR

...So you had enough time to think 

about it?


TOM

Yeah, well, circumstances have 

changed.


CASPAR

Don't I know it.  Last night, I know 

Bluepoint was disappointed the bulls 

showed up before Frankie and Tic-Tac 

could really pin your ears back, but 

I said, Relax, Bluepoint, I got a 

feeling about this kid.  Take the 

long view.  The kid and Leo are gonna 

go bust-o.  If the kid ain't ready 

yet, well, he soon will be.  Matter 

of time.  I said, the kid's too smart 

for Leo.  That's what I said.  Like 

a psychic.  Ask Bluepoint if I didn't.  

Like a goddamn psychic.  G'ahead.  

Ask him.


Tom turns to look at Bluepoint.


TOM

You vouch for this psychic business?


From the couch, Bluepoint sneers:


BLUEPOINT

That's right, smart guy.


Caspar cheerfully continues, oblivious to any hostility in 

the room:


CASPAR

I know you knew protecting the Motzah 

was a dumb idea.  I know you been 

wise to all of Leo's dumb ideas 

lately.  Only a matter of time.  

Bust-o.


He chuckles.


CASPAR

...That's why last night we didn't 

put the arm on you.  Only Leo.


TOM

Seeing how you squiffed your play on 

Leo, I can be only so grateful.


BLUEPOINT

That's brave, coming from Little 

Miss Punching Bag.


CASPAR

C'mon Bluepoint.  Friends now, huh?


BLUEPOINT

Nuts.


Caspar smiles at Tom.


CASPAR

So we get a little jingle.  And I 

figure you know Leo's on his way 

out.  It's only a matter of time 

before we get him.  Am I right, kid?


TOM

Maybe.


Caspar laughs.


CASPAR

What maybe.  You know or you wouldn't 

be bust-o.  So I guess you're looking 

for a job?


TOM

I might be.


Caspar laughs.


CASPAR

You got references?  You been to 

college, kid?  We only take yeggs 

what's been to college.  Ain't that 

right, Bluepoint?


Bluepoint says nothing.  His scowl is set in cement.


CASPAR

...I'm jokin', of course.  We all 

know you can be useful to us, a smart 

kid such as yaself, the man who walks 

behind the man and whispers in his 

ear.  I guess you could be useful, 

in spades.


TOM

Yeah.  I can do plenty for you.  But 

the fact is that right now Leo's 

still got all his vital signs and 

once he hears about this he'll be 

more anxious to get to me than to 

either of you.


CASPAR

I'm tellin' ya not to worry about 

Leo.  We got plans for him.


TOM

Yeah?  What?


BLUEPOINT

Not so fast there, Kaputnik.


There is a beat through which Caspar continues to smile at 

Tom.


CASPAR

...I think what the Bluepoint is 

trying to say is, there'll be time 

to talk about that.  That can be 

tabled for a later date.  See, the 

last time we jawed you gave-me the 

high hat.  So I guess I'm sayin', 

maybe we want your confidence before 

we give you ours.  You gotta put 

somethin' on the table.  Ante up.


TOM

Fair enough.  Where shall we start.


CASPAR

Hear that, Bluepoint?  All business!  

I told you he was a good kid!  Where 

shall we start!  All business!...


He rocks back in his chair and dries his eyes.  Tom smiles 

pleasantly.  Finally Caspar sighs.


CASPAR

...Well, we could start for instance 

with the Motzah... Like where's the 

Motzah?  You could maybe tell us 

that...


TOM

The Royale.  Room three-oh-two.  You 

might find Mink with him.


BLUEPOINT

The hell you say.


TOM

Sure, Bernie and Mink are as cozy as 

lice.


He turns to look at Bluepoint.


TOM

...And it ain't just business.


Caspar looks at Bluepoint.  Bluepoint's eyes bare into Tom.


BLUEPOINT

This guy's lying.


Tom shrugs.


TOM

Why would I?


BLUEPOINT

This guy's wrong.  This guy's all 

wrong.  Mink is clean and this clown 

is a smart guy.


Caspar is still staring at Bluepoint, no longer smiling.


CASPAR

Easy enough to find out, ain't it?  

You find Mink, bring him back here.


He nods at Tom.


CASPAR

...You go down to the car.  I'll 

send Frankie and Tic-Tac with you to 

the Royale.  If Bernie's there, 

Frankie and Tic-Tac'll take care of 

him.


BLUEPOINT

And if he's not there?


Tom shrugs.


TOM

I'll sit facing the corner in a funny 

hat.


CUT TO


INT. CAR


Tom sits behind the wheel of the parked car; we are on his 

profile.


Tom's face is rigidly set; we don't know why as we watch him 

for a short beat.


BAM--with a loud impact Bernie Bernheim's face is slammed 

against the driver's window.  Tom still faces forward.


Bernie is wailing as he is muscled back away from the window 

by two topcoated torsos--their faces above the car window.


They muscle Bernie out of frame towards the rear of the car 

and we hear the back door being opened.


Bernie's voice, off, is near hysteria:


BERNIE

Frankie, let me go, I'm prayin' to 

ya, Jesus God--Tom!  Jesus!


As Frankie and Tic-Tac pile Bernie into the back, we continue 

to hold on Tom's face.  He still does not react.


BERNIE

...Are you part of this?!  You can't 

be part of this!  I think these 

guys're gonna whack me!  You gotta 

talk to 'em, Tommy!


FRANKIE

You gimme a headache, you little 

sheeny.


To Tom:


TIC-TAC

Okay, we're going to Miller's 

Crossing.


Tom still doesn't react.  There is a beat of Bernie's crying.  


Finally:


FRANKIE

...Lets go!


As Tom reaches forward and starts the car:


BERNIE

You're not part of this!  Tom!  Help 

me!  These guys are gonna whack me!


TIC-TAC

Whack you inna mouth you don't shut 

up.


MILLER'S CROSSING - WIDE


Day.  A wooded area outside of town.  The wind blows.


The car pulls into frame and stops on the shoulder.  The 

backseat passengers--Frankie, Tic-Tac and Bernie--emerge; 


Tom remains in the driver's seat.


Bernie is weeping, loudly; he has lost control.  Frankie 

takes out a gun and whacks him smartly on the side of his 

head.  The blow sends him stumbling over towards Tic-Tac, 

who kicks him down.


The blows haven't quelled Bernie's sobbing.


TIC-TAC

I don't want you runnin' anywhere.


Frankie takes a swig from his flask and hands it to Tic-Tac, 

who leans in the car window.


INT. CAR


Tom gazes forward, jaw set, eyes off the doings outside.


As Tic-Tac hands his gun in through the window:


TIC-TAC

Kay.  Take him in the woods and whack 

him.


TOM

Huh?  I don't...


TIC-TAC

Yeah, that's right, the boss wants 

you to do it.  Make sure you're with 

the good guys.


Tom stares dumbly at the gun.  Tic-Tac holds it, grip towards 

Tom, motionless.


After a beat he takes the gun.


TIC-TAC

You know how to do this, right?  You 

gotta remember to put one in his 

brain.  Your first shot puts him 

down, then you put one in his brain.  

Then he's dead, then we go home.


Tom opens his door.


WIDE EXT.


Bernie is still on the ground, sobbing, not responding to 

Frankie who prods him with his foot.


FRANKIE

Get up.


BERNIE

I can't get up!  I can't get up!


Frankie drags him to his feet.


FRANKIE

Get up and walk, you chiselin' little 

yid.


He pushes him towards the woods and reaches for the whiskey 

flask.


Bernie stumbles off; Tom follows him.


TRACK


Through the woods, pulling the two men, Bernie in the 

foreground.  Tree limbs groan in the wind.


Bernie is stumbling, his clothes rumpled and dirty, his face 

stained by tears and blood from the gun blow.  His shaking 

voice strains for a tone of reasonableness:


BERNIE

...Tommy, you can't do this.  You 

don't bump guys.  You're not like 

those animals back there...


Tom marches on, face drawn, silent.


BERNIE

...It's not right, Tom.  They can't 

make us do this.  It's a wrong 

situation.  They can't make us 

different people than we are.  We're 

not muscle, Tom.  I never killed 

anybody.  I used a little information 

for a chisel, that's all.  I couldn't 

help it, Tom, it's my nature.  

Somebody hands me an angle, I play 

it.  I don't deserve to die for that!  

D'you think I do?  I'm just a grifter!  

Huh, Tom?


Still no response from Tom.  Bernie is fighting a losing 

battle to keep himself from whining.


BERNIE

...But I'll tell you what, I never 

crossed a friend.  Huh, Tom?  Never 

killed anybody, never crossed a 

friend.  Nor you, I'll bet.  We're 

not like those animals.  You can't 

do this!  You're not like those 

animals.  This is not us!  This is 

some hop dream!


Tom's face is a stony mask.  Bernie is losing control again.  

He starts to weep.


BERNIE

...It's a dream!  Tommy!  I'm praying 

to you!  I can't die!  I can't die!  

Out here in the woods!  Like a dumb 

animal!  I can't die!


He turns and sinks to his knees, wailing, his hands clasped 

in front of him, staring up at Tom.


BERNIE

...You can't kill me.  I'm praying 

to you! look in your heart!  I'm 

praying to you!  Look in your heart!


Tom stares down at Bernie, his face drawn and pale.


BERNIE

...I'm praying to you!  Look in your 

heart!


Slowly Tom raises the gun and levels it at Bernie's head.


BERNIE

...Look in your heart!  Look in your--


BOOM!  The gun blast is deafening.  With it, Bernie's sobbing 

abruptly stops.


The shot echoes away in the woods, taking the wind with it, 

leaving silence.


CLOSE BERNIE


Still kneeling, in shock, staring wide-eyed at Tom.


Finally, whispering:


BERNIE

...Tommy.


TOM

Shutup.  You're dead, get me?


Still whispering:


BERNIE

I understand.  I'm dead.  God bless 

you--


TOM

Shutup.  You have to disappear.  You 

have to blow, for good.  Nobody can 

see you, nobody can know.


BERNIE

God bless you--


TOM

Go somewhere no one knows you.  Anyone 

sees you, you really are dead, I 

don't care, you're not my problem 

any more.


BERNIE

Of course not.  Of course not.  You've 

done your share.  Thank you.  Don't 

worry, I understand.  Thank you--


TOM

Shutup. Just get the hell out, before 

I change my mind.


Bernie is already on his feet, and running.


CLOSE ON TOM


Watching Bernie go.


TRACKING


Pulling Bernie as he runs.  Foreground trees flash by.  In 

the background we see Tom standing, his gun dangling at his 

side.


Boom!--another gun blast.  Running, Bernie reacts, but Tom 

has only fired into the ground.


On the echo of the shot we cut to:


WIDE THE ROAD


Tic-Tac and Frankie are leaning against the car, trading the 

flask back and forth.


In the background, Tom emerges from the woods.


FRANKIE

Put one in his brain?


Tom takes a few steps more before answering:


TOM

...Yeah.


FRANKIE

Attaboy.


FADE OUT


Over black we hear the sound of coins being dropped into a 

phone box.


FADE IN


Looking down a deserted street towards a glowing phone booth 

on a dark corner.  Tom stands inside the booth waiting, the 

receiver to his ear.


TOM

Mink?  Tom Duchaisne.  Where've you 

been?...


CLOSE ON TOM


Inside the phone booth.


TOM

...Well you're lucky, Bluepoint's 

been looking for you.  Bernie's dead--

Stop wailing and listen to me.  Caspar 

knows you were in on selling out his 

fix... I guess I gave him that idea.  

Sorry Mink, we were chatting and it 

just slipped out.-- Shutup and let 

me talk.  You've gotta make yourself 

missing, but let me know where you 

hole up.  You're gonna say some things 

for me...  Some stories.  About 

Bluepoint, to Caspar--don't worry, 

I'll let you know.  For now just 

disappear... Yeah, I got you into 

it.  Just remember, Mink, I'm the 

only one who can get you out.


Tom hangs up the phone, turns around and opens up the glass 

door.


WHOMMMP!  A fist slams into his stomach, driving him back 

into the phone booth, knocking his hat off of his head.


The man who hit him leans down, picks up the hat, dusts it 

off and hands it into the booth.  It is Dead Terry, the tall 

cadaverous man we saw earlier outside of Leo's office.  A 

cigarette dangles from his lower lip.


Behind him a black sedan is parked at the curb.  Three or 

four gunmen stand on the sidewalk looking warily up and down 

the road.


Tom looks up, the color drained from his face, and reaches 

feebly out for his hat.


TOM

'Lo, Terry.  Getting out the vote?


Dead Terry flicks his cigarette away and smiles.


TERRY

Message from Leo.  Leo says, if you're 

smart you'll sit this one out--not 

that he cares one way or the other.  

Leo says if you're on the wrong side 

you take your chances, like anyone 

else.  Leo says he gives no special 

favors.  That's all.


TOM

Mm...


Terry starts to turn away.


TOM

...Tell Leo he's not God on the 

throne, he's just a cheap mick 

political boss with no brains and an 

office that looks like a French 

whorehouse.


Tom moves to exit the booth but Terry lays a hand on his 

shoulder.


TERRY

One more thing...


He cracks Tom across the chin with a clean left hook, knocking 

him back into the booth again.


Tom rubs his chin, looking up at Terry.


TOM

Leo say that too...?


As Terry and the gunmen get into the car:


TERRY

No, I said that.  Cross Leo and next 

time I'll say plenty.


We FADE OUT as the door slams and the car roars off.


OVER BLACK WE HEAR:


CASPAR

When you're right you're right, but 

you never say I told you so.


FADE IN


On Tom, sitting into frame in Caspar's office.


TOM

So what'm I right about?


Behind his desk, Caspar is smiling.


CASPAR

Well, I'll tell ya, but first you 

gotta promise not to say I told you 

so.


Tom's eyes hold an Caspar's.  He is taking out a pack of 

cigarettes.


TOM

I never say that.  And I don't like 

people who do.


CASPAR

Mink was robbin' me right along with 

the Motzah.


TOM

...What convinced you of that?


CASPAR

Mink Larouie took a powder.  We can't 

find him.  Bluepoint's makin' excuses 

for him, but personally, I think you 

were right.  I think Mink and Bernie 

was in it together.  I think Mink 

heard you'd bumped the Motzah, and 

lit out.  The lousy sonofabitch.


His eyes on Caspar, Tom takes out a cigarette, lights it, 

takes a deep drag.


TOM

...I told you so.


Caspar laughs.


CASPAR

Okay.  You got a lip on ya.  Ats all 

right.  I don't generally care for 

it, but that's all right... You were 

a good sport to bump the Motzah.  I 

just like to make sure my friends is 

my friends.  So.


He throws his hands up.


CASPAR

...Friends, right?


TOM

How d'you know Mink skipped?


CASPAR

Bluepoint can't find him.


TOM

So he says.


Caspar stares at Tom.


CASPAR

Meanin' what, exactly?


TOM

Maybe nothing... I didn't give it 

much thought until now, since a guy 

will say pretty much anything when 

he knows his number is up, but just 

before I bumped Bernie he swore to 

me that Bluepoint and Mink were 

setting him up.  That they were the 

ones that were selling out your fix.


Caspar looks at Tom.


CASPAR

'Zat so...


He thinks for a beat.


CASPAR

...Like you say, a guy'll say 

anything.


TOM

...Uh-huh.  So why isn't Bluepoint 

here?


CASPAR

Well...


He fidgets.


CASPAR

...He don't care for you, kid.  Maybe 

it's only fair to tell you...  After 

you left us, he tried to sell me on 

a double-cross.  He says to me, why 

don't we double-cross you and give 

you the bump once we get the Motzah.  

But I figure a deals a deal, you're 

square with me, you bump the Motzah, 

I'll hold up my end.  Question of 

ethics.  Everything above board, 

that's how I like it, so everybody 

knows who's a friend and who's an 

enemy...  But Bluepoint wouldn't 

cross me.  We go back.


TOM

Uh-huh... Course, there's always 

that wild card when love is 

involved...


Caspar is staring intently at Tom.  After a beat:


CASPAR

...I know Mink is Bluepoint's boy, 

but I still don't make it that way.


TOM

Mm.  Well, then there's nothing to 

worry about.


Caspar seems lost in thought:


CASPAR

Yeah...


We hear the door to the office open offscreen and Johnny Jr. 

runs into frame clutching a scrolled piece of paper.


JOHNNY JR.

Poppa!  Poppa!  I got a prize from 

the--


Caspar holds his hand up to quiet the youngster, still looking 

at Tom.


CASPAR

Just a minute.


As Tom rises to his feet:


CASPAR

...Course, there's no reason not to 

be careful--


JOHNNY JR.

Poppa!  Poppa!  The sisters gave me 

a--unnnh!


Caspar has cuffed him sharply on the side of the head.  He 

points at Tom.


CASPAR

Shaddap!  You take a page outta this 

guy's book.  A little less you talk 

and a little more you think!


Caspar looks at Tom and smiles.


CASPAR

...Kids.  Ya gotta be firm.  Anyways.  

You know what I'm sayin'.  No reason 

to worry but no reason not to 

investigate, neither.  If Mink is 

around I want you to find him.  He 

can tell us what's what...

(to Johnny Jr.:)

...What's a matter, somebody hit 

you, what's a matter, we ain't friends 

anymore?...


He picks up Johnny Jr., who is crying softly, and sets him 

in his lap.  Encouraged by the attention, the child starts 

wailing.  Caspar bounces him on his knee and raises his voice 

over the sobs:


CASPAR

...If you find him, I wanna talk to 

him alone.  That's how you get the 

straight dope.  Man-to- man.  Just 

me, Mink...


He pats his jacket where his shoulder holster is.


CASPAR

...and my friend roscoe.  Y'understand 

what I'm sayin'?


Tom takes a contemplative drag on his cigarette.


TOM

...It ain't complicated.


CUT TO


CLOSE SHOT - A MAN'S FACE


Crunch!--being hit by a gloved hand.


The blow and the man's grunt echo.


CLOSE ON A NEWSPAPER


As the noise of fists against flesh continues, echoing, in 

the background.


The newspaper headline reads:


PARTY BOSS LOOSES MUNICIPAL CONTRACT.


The subhead reads:


Lima (Leo) O'Bannon Removed From City Highway Commission;  

New Construction Contracts To Raffo Bros.


ON TOM


Leaning against a pillar in a large bare room with a hardwood 

floor.  He is reading the newspaper.


We are in a gym.  In a ring in the background two boxers are 

sparring as two or three old men with towels slung over their 

shoulders and elbows hooked over the ropes idly watch, and 

offer occasional bits of half-hearted advice.


We hear high heels echoing across the floor and Verna enters.


TOM

You should leave town for a few days; 

things are going to heat up here.  

Go out to the Pallisades; I'll join 

you once I'm done.


VERNA

...I can't find Bernie.  Did you 

find him?


Tom looks out at the fighters in the background, avoiding 

Verna's look.


TOM

...Yeah.


VERNA

Is he leaving?


TOM

He left.


VERNA

Where to?


TOM

...He didn't say.  You should--


She reaches out to touch his hand--


VERNA

Thanks.


She leans in to embrace him.


Tom's eyes drift up to the fighters.


EXT. THE GYM


Peeling paint on its blackened-out window reads: Gleason's 

Gym.  Training in The Sweet Science.


Verna is exiting the gym in long shot.


We pull back to bring Bluepoint into frame.  He sits in the 

driver's seat of a car, watching through his side window as 

Verna recedes.


Quietly:


BLUEPOINT

What's he up to?


An offscreen voice, a passenger:


VOICE

I dunno.


BLUEPOINT

That's Bernie's sister, isn't it?


VOICE

I dunno.


Bluepoint thinks, a short beat.


BLUEPOINT

What's he seeing her for?


VOICE

I dunno, maybe he's--


BLUEPOINT

Shutup.  Get outta the car.  Stick 

with the bighead.


Bluepoint reaches for the ignition, as we hear the car door 

open.


BLUEPOINT

...I'll see where the twist flops.


CUT TO


INT. SPEAKEASY


A hand swings through frame holding the barrel of a gun, 

smashing the butt into a surprised face.


With a loud crash the surprised man stumbles back into a 

table and hits the floor.  Legs and the skirts of an overcoat 

approach the prostrate, round, middle-aged man and start 

kicking him.


He rolls across the floor trying to shield himself from the 

blows.


VOICE

(off)

C'mon, get up.  I just wanna talk.


ANOTHER VOICE

(off)

Yeah, get up.  He ain't gonna hurt 

ya.


ROUND MAN

He already hurt me!  He broke my 

goddamn nose!


Whisper, the man standing over him, has a long scar across 

his neck.  He has a rasping voice:


WHISPER

So what?  I had my nose broke once.


ROUND MAN

I already paid Leo's men.


Bert, another enforcer, is down at the end of the bar with 

Tom.


BERT

You still pay Leo for protection?  

Is he protectin' you?


As he kicks at the little round man:


WHISPER

We's protectin' you.  Johnny Caspar's 

runnin' things or maybe you ain't 

heard.


In the background Whisper continues to heckle and kick at 

the round man as Bert and Tom talk in the foreground.


TOM

So Bluepoint hasn't got a line on 

Leo yet?


BERT

Not that I know about.  He's been 

lookin', but I guess Leo's been movin' 

around and--hoist this over the bar, 

will ya?--and things've been kinda 

hectic.


He is handing Tom a briefcase.  As Tom leans over the bar to 

drop it behind:


TOM

Do me a favor--let me know if he 

finds anything.


Bert is pouring himself a drink.


BERT

Yeah, okay--


Whisper, gun drawn, calls from the back of the bar:


WHISPER

I'm gonna put this one to sleep, 

wuddya think Bert?


Bert shrugs into his overcoat.


BERT

Yeah, okay.


TOM

If you kill him he won't be able to 

think things over.


WHISPER

He don't seem like such a hot thinker.


TOM

You'll think about what you've learned 

here, won't you Louie?


ROUND MAN

You bet, Tom, I'll think plenty!


Bert shrugs.


BERT

Ah, what the hell...


The round man scrambles to his feet and runs out the back 

door.  Whisper puts away his gun and saunters over to Tom 

and Bert.


As the three men head for the front door:


BERT

...If we can't trust a dago, the 

whole thing's hopeless anyway.


EXT. SPEAKEASY


As the three men emerge into the afternoon sun.


TOM

So, are we winning?


Bert gives a so-so flutter of his hand.


BERT

It's tough.  Leo's still got some 

teeth left.  His men bushwhacked 

Tony Campisi last night, slit his 

throat.


WHISPER

Yeah?  He die?


BERT

I said, they slit his throat.


WHISPER

So what, genius?  I had my t'roat 

slit once.


TOM

Sure Whisper, but normal people's 

brains need oxygen--


BOOM!--Behind the three men the front of the speakeasy blows--

glass flying, flame licking out.


Though there is commotion among the passers-by, Tom, Bert 

and Whisper don't even turn around to look.


BERT

Get the car, will ya Whisper?


As Whisper trots out into the street:


TOM

Don't tell Bluepoint I was asking 

about him.


BERT

Yeah yeah.


TOM

Caspar just wanted me to check up, 

make sure he's doing everything he 

can--


There is a faint but distinct popping sound.


Tom looks into the street.


Whisper is staggering around, as if drunk.  He turns to face 

Tom and Bert.


He lurches toward them.  A red stain is blossoming on his 

chest.


The ambient hubbub fades to total silence; we hear only the 

crisp staggering scuffle of Whisper's shoes as he stumbles 

into the foreground, looking stunned.


He drops.


A woman screams.


Noise wells up.


Bert is upholstering his gun, looking up.


Tom looks where Bert is looking.


FACING ROOFTOP


A man with a distinctive shock of white hair--Dead Terry 

McGill.  He puts up his gun and starts running along the 

roof.


BERT


Starts running along the street to keep pace, firing up at 

the facing roof.


A POLICE CAR


Siren wailing, up on two wheels, taking a speeding turn onto 

the street.


It is speeding towards Bert.


PULLING BERT


Running, he is pointing, and bellowing at the car:


BERT

Leo's man!  Up there!


POLICE CAR


Cops with guns hang out every window.  They start firing.


TRACKING TOWARDS BERT


BERT

...Up there!  Leo's--


A hail of bullets cuts him to pieces.  A limp rag, he hits 

the road.


The police car squeals to a halt in front of his corpse.  A 

sergeant and his men pile out.


Tom is sauntering over, smoking a cigarette.


SERGEANT

'Lo, Tom.  Chalk one up for the good 

guys, huh?


TOM

Yeah, Caspar'll be thrilled.  You 

just shot one of his apes.


SERGEANT

Bullshit!


Tom's attention is drawn by something down the street.


HIS POV


About a block away, a man with white hair is crossing the 

street, from the side where the sniper's shot came from.


SERGEANT

(off)

I'm tellin' you that's Two-Toe 

Jackson!  He's Leo's!


BACK TO TOM


As he starts to leave.


TOM

It's Bert Sachetti, Caspar's bag-

man.


Behind him the Sergeant bellows at another cop:


SERGEANT

Bullshit!  Take his shoes off.  Count 

his goddamn toes!


INT. DINER


Dead Terry McGill sits at a stool looking angrily down at a 

cup of coffee.  Tom enters to sit next to him.


Through the windows behind them, we can see people running


back and forth on the street, a fire engine racing past-- 

furious activity, its noise muted inside the diner.


TOM

'Lo, Terry.  You weren't aiming at 

me, were you?


Terry does not even look over at him.  Sullenly:


TERRY

In the first place, I don't know 

what you're talking about.  In the 

second place, if I had been aiming 

at you I'd've hit you.  In the third 

place, I don't know what you're 

talking about in the first place.


He tosses some coins onto the counter and gets up.  We hold 

on Tom as Terry talks to Tom's back:


TERRY

...I'd like to have, believe me.  

Leo won't let me--yet.  But I'll 

bring him around.


He puts a hand on Tom's shoulder and swivels him around.  

Terry clenches a fist and draws it back to throw a punch.


Tom and Terry look at each other, Tom making no movement to 

defend himself.


After a long beat, Terry unclenches his fist and sneers:


TERRY

...I won't give you the satisfaction.


CUT TO


DOORKNOB


As--CRASH--a foot enters to kick it and the door in.


INT. VERNA'S APARTMENT


Verna is backing away from the door--behind us--into the 

apartment.  Bluepoint strides into frame.


BLUEPOINT

Know who I am?


Verna continues to back away; Bluepoint continues to advance.


VERNA

Yeah, Johnny Caspar's shadow.  Did 

he stay in bed today?


BLUEPOINT

Jesus.  I open my mouth, the whole 

world turns smart...


He glances around the room.  Verna is backing around the 

couch.  Bluepoint continues to follow her.


BLUEPOINT

...What business d'you have with Tom 

Duchaisne?


VERNA

None.


She continues to back away; Bluepoint continues to follow.


BLUEPOINT

You're Leo's twist, right?


VERNA

Me and Leo are through.


She picks up her purse from the sill behind the couch and 

rummages.  Bluepoint doesn't seem to mind.


BLUEPOINT

Yeah?  So you're sluttin' around 

with Tom now, huh?


Verna has taken a gun from her purse; she levels it at 

Bluepoint.


VERNA

Get outta here.


As he continues to stride towards her:


BLUEPOINT

Okay, see ya later...


His hand shoots out in a flash--he has grabbed the gun with 

one hand, her arm with the other.


BLUEPOINT

...Before I go, what's your boyfriend 

up to?


Verna is struggling in his grasp to no effect.


VERNA

Nothing I know about.


Bluepoint drags her close, nose to nose:


BLUEPOINT

Yeah?  It doesn't figure for me, 

your dumping Leo for the guy who put 

a bullet in your brother.


Verna stops resisting and stares at him.


Bluepoint stares back at her, thinking.


BLUEPOINT

...Didn't tell you, huh?


We hear a footstep offscreen.


REVERSE


Facing the door, from behind Bluepoint and Verna.


Bluepoint wheels, swinging her body in front of his as two 

topcoated men enter, guns drawn.


Both intruders hold fire, their shot blocked by Verna.  The 

gun in Bluepoint's hand barks once.


The lead man pitches forward, his gun clattering away.


His partner is ducking back out the door.


Verna still struggles futilely; Bluepoint keeps his gun, 

peeking out from behind Verna, trained on the empty doorway.


The man an the floor, still alive, has started clawing himself 

towards his gun, a few paces away.


Bluepoint ignores him.  He stares at the open door.


After a silent beat, from the hall:


MAN IN HALL

...Let her go, Bluepoint, there's 

nothing you can do.  Leave by the 

fire escape.  There's more of us on 

the way--


BANG--Bluepoint fires.


Wood splinters in the door, which shudders back a few more 

inches towards the wall.  The voice from the hall has stopped 

short.


After a short silent beat, we hear a gun clattering to the 

floor outside in the hall.


We hear fabric drag across wall, and then see the dead man 

drop to the floor just outside the door.


Bluepoint tosses Verna away and saunters unhurriedly over to 

the first man, who has almost reached his gun.


Just as the man's hand closes over it Bluepoint, in stride, 

steps onto the hand and gun.  Most of his weight is on it.


Head cocked, he looks down at the man in front of him.


BLUEPOINT

...You Leo's?


MAN

Yeah.  He wanted her looked out for.


BLUEPOINT

Well you did a bang-up job; I'll be 

sure to tell him.  Where is Leo?


MAN

...If I tell you, how do know you 

won't kill me?


BLUEPOINT

Because if you told me, and I killed 

you, and you were lying, then I 

wouldn't get to kill you then.  

Where's Leo?


The man is sweating.


MAN

...He's--he's moving around.  But 

tomorrow night he's getting his mob 

together at Whiskey Nick's.


Bluepoint points his gun at the man's head.


BLUEPOINT

You sure?


MAN

Check it.  It's gold.


BLUEPOINT

You know something, yegg?  I believe 

you.


BANG.


Bluepoint straightens up from the body and turns.


LOW AND WIDE ON BLUEPOINT


One corpse on the floor beside him, the other corpse in the 

doorway behind him.


He absently wraps one hand around the warm barrel of the 

gun, then brings the hand up to blow against its open palm.


BLUEPOINT

Go ahead and run, sweetie...


HIS POV THE WINDOW


The main zoom is now empty.  Sheers billow at the window, 

now open, that let's out on the fire escape.


Off:


BLUEPOINT

...I'll track down all a you whores.


DISSOLVE THROUGH TO 


WINDOW  NIGHT


Sheers billow in the breeze.


TOM


Sitting up in bed, smoking a cigarette, thinking.  The bedroom 

is dark.


There is a knock at the apartment's front door. Tom reacts, 

but does not immediately rise.


The knock is repeated.


Tom finally throws the covers off and swings his feet around 

to the floor.


But the knocking stops and another sound brings him up short:  

The person at the door is now playing with the lock.


Tom sits motionless, listening.


After some rattling we hear the lock spring, then the door 

swinging open, then shut again.  We hear footsteps cross the 

main room, and then the squeak of chair springs.


Silence.


Tom rises and walks to the living room doorway.  He leans 

against the jamb.


HIS POV


The windows throw moonlit squares onto the floor.  We can 

see only the legs of someone sitting in the armchair.


TOM

'Lo, Bernie.  Come on in, make 

yourself at home.


Bernie turns on the lamp on the table at his elbow.  He holds 

a gun casually in his lap.


BERNIE

'Lo, Tom.  Thought I'd do that, since 

you didn't seem to be in.  Figured 

it was a bad idea to wait in the 

hall, seeing as I'm supposed to be 

dead.


TOM

Mm.


BERNIE

How'd you know it was me?


TOM

You're the only person I know'd knock 

and break in.


BERNIE

Your other friends wouldn't break 

in, huh?


Tom shakes his head.


TOM

My other friends wanna kill me, so 

they wouldn't knock.


He crosses to the chair facing Bernie's.


TOM

...What's on your mind, Bernie?


BERNIE

Things... I guess you must be kind 

of angry.  I'm supposed to be gone, 

far away.  I guess it seems sort of 

irresponsible, my being here...


Bernie leaves room for a response but Tom is only listening.


BERNIE

...And I was gonna leave.  Honest I 

was.  But then I started thinking.  

If I stuck around, that would not be 

good for you.  And then I started 

thinking that... that might not be 

bad for me.


Tom still doesn't answer.


BERNIE

...I guess you didn't see the play 

you gave me.  I mean what'm I gonna 

do?  If I leave, I got nothing--no 

money, no friends, nothing.  If I 

stay, I got you.  Anyone finds out 

I'm alive--you're dead, so... I got 

you, Tommy.


Tom is silent.


BERNIE

...What's the matter, you got nothin' 

to crack wise about?  Bernie ain't 

so funny anymore?


Bernie's lip is quivering.  His voice is softer:


BERNIE

...I guess I made kinda a fool a 

myself out there... I was shittin' 

myself, Tommy... you didn't tell 

anyone about that.


TOM

No.


BERNIE

'Course you know about it... its... 

It's a painful memory.  And I can't 

help remembering that you put the 

finger on me, and you took me out 

there to whack me... I know you 

didn't... I know you didn't shoot 

me... but... but--


TOM

But what have I done for you lately?


BERNIE

Don't smart me.


He stares hard at Tom for a moment.


BERNIE

... See, I wanna watch you squirm.  

I wanna see you sweat a little.  And 

when you smart me, it ruins it.


Bernie gets to his feet, keeping the gun trained on Tom.


BERNIE

...There's one other thing I want.  

I wanna see Johnny Caspar cold and 

stiff.  That's what you'll do for 

your friend Bernie...


He has opened the door to the flat.


BERNIE

...In the meantime I'll stay outa 

sight.  But if Caspar ain't stiff in 

a couple of days I start eating in 

restaurants.


The door shuts behind him.


Tom, heretofore very still, springs from the chair, goes to 

the bedroom and reemerges with a gun.


He bolts for the door, instinctively grabbing his hat off a 

hook.  He is wearing only his boxer shorts, a sleeveless tee-

shirt, and the hat jammed onto his head.


He throws open the door.


HALLWAY


Empty.


Tom runs to the banister and looks down.


HIS POV


A flight down, a hand slides down along the railing.  Bernie's 

trotting footsteps echo in the stairwell.


TOM


He runs back to his apartment.


APARTMENT


Tom runs across to the open window and clambers out.


FIRE ESCAPE


Tom trots down.  His bare feet ring dully against the steel 

of the fire escape.


He reaches the bottom landing, swings over the railing, hangs 

by his hands for one brief moment and then drops.


THE ALLEY


As his bare feet hit the pavement.  Tom is a silhouette in 

the lamplight from the end of the alley.


He straightens from his crouch and runs.


BACK DOOR


Of his apartment building--over Tom's shoulder as he enters 

frame.  The empty, brightly lit hall inside runs straight 

the length of the building to the front door, which is just 

closing.


Tom throws open the back door.


HALLWAY


As Tom runs through toward the front.


Before reaching the door, he falls violently forward.


His gun skates away from him across the floor.


He starts to roll over to look behind him and a crunching 

blow catches him on the chin, snapping his head the rest of 

the way around and sending him flat onto his back.


Bernie, who has emerged from under the staircase, towers 

over him.


BERNIE

You make me laugh, Tommy.  You're 

gonna catch cold, then you're no 

good to me...


He is walking over to Tom's gun, which he picks up and unloads 

into his hand.


BERNIE

...What were you gonna do if you 

caught me, I'd just squirt a few and 

then you'd let me go again.


He tosses Tom the empty gun and walks out.


Tom, white-faced and shivering, pulls himself up to sit 

leaning against the wall.


A first-floor apartment door opens and a sixty-year-old woman 

emerges, pulling a housecoat tight.  She goggles at Tom.


WOMAN

Why Mr. Duchaisne!  What on earth...


Tom tries a smile that looks idiotic.


TOM

They took everything...


LONG SHOT THE HALL


Clucking sympathetically, the old woman is leaning down to 

help Tom up.  As he drapes an arm over her shoulder:


TOM

...I fought like hell but there were 

too many of 'em...


FADE OUT


CUT TO


CLOSE SHOT PLAQUE


Set into an exterior wall, identifying the SHENANDOAH CLUB.


INT. CLUB


Tom, in his overcoat and hat, is walking up to the bar.


TOM

'Lo, Tony.  How's the club holding 

up?


Behind the bar, Tony looks sour.


TONY

We're managing to squeak by without 

you.  Got Lazarre's money?


TOM

No.


TONY

Well, you're not supposed to be here 

since you turned rat.


TOM

Relax, Tony, Leo's not around, is 

he?


TONY

Maybe Leo's not the only one doesn't 

care for you here.


Tom works to keep his smile.


TOM

...Fickle, huh Tony?  You could almost 

be a dame.


TONY

Pal, you read my mind, you sneak my 

thoughts.  Jesus, I hope you know 

what you're doing.


TOM

No more than usual.  The last couple 

days, you booked any heavy bets on a 

long shot at Saturday's fights?


TONY

Why the hell should I tell you?


Tom shrugs.


TOM

The truth is Tony, there's no reason 

on earth.


Staring at Tom, Tony blows air through his teeth.  He sets 

up a drink for Tom.


TONY

...Saturday's fights.  Yeah.  Drop 

Johnson parked two yards on one 

yesterday.  On Sailor Reese, an 

undercard bum.


Tom downs the drink in a gulp.


TOM

Drop Johnson?  He play your book 

much?


TONY

You kidding?  I didn't even know he 

could count.


From offscreen there is a loud CRASH and, with that, many of 

the club patrons start screaming.  Tony looks off and Tom 

swivels to look.


TONY

Oh Jesus... You bring them with you?


As he shoves off from the bar:


TOM

No.


Uniformed policemen are pouring into the club, wielding axes.  

They destroy everything in their path, sweeping the elegantly 

dressed patrons before them.


Tom wades into the sea of blue and nods at Delahanty, the 

policeman we know from the raid on Caspar's.


TOM

'Lo, Brian.  Still fighting the good 

fight?


DELAHANTY

'Lo, Tom.  Neither wind nor rain nor 

snow...


TOM

That's just the mailmen.  Is O'Gar 

here?


DELAHANTY

Just look for the long face.


EXT. THE CLUB


It is just cracking dawn.


O'Gar is leaning against a car, facing the club, taking in 

the scene as he glumly chews on a toothpick.  The street is 

clogged with police vehicles.


Tom approaches.


TOM

'Lo, O'Gar.  You don't look happy.


O'GAR

Look at this mess.  Gutting the golden 

calf again.


He shakes his head.


O'GAR

...I don't know whether to laugh or 

cry.


TOM

Yeah, it's awful confusing.  You 

know a yegg named Drop Johnson?


O'GAR

We've spanked him a couple times.


TOM

Where does he flop?


O'GAR

The Terminal Hotel on Bay Street, 

whenever he's broke--which is one 

hundred percent of always.  Jesus...


He reacts to gunfire from the second story of the club.


O'GAR

...Don't nobody ask me, since I'm 

only the chief around here, but I'll 

tell you my opinion: Caspar's just 

as crazy as Leo.  And an eye-tie 

into the bargain.


As he heads off:


TOM

What's the matter, O'Gar, doesn't 

anything ever suit you?


PULLING TOM


As he walks along a nearby street; we can still faintly hear 

the sirens and police activity back at the club.


A black touring car is tooling up alongside of him.  Tic-Atc 

leans out the driver's window.  He has welts around his mouth 

and looks like he has been a little roughed up.


TIC-TAC

Hop in, Tom, we been lookin' for 

you.


Still briskly walking:


TOM

I'm busy.


TIC-TAC

Hop in anyway, as in you ain't got 

no choice.


TOM

You can't hijack me, Tic-Tac, we're 

on the same side now--or didn't you 

get that far in school?


The car screeches over to put a wheel on the sidewalk and 

block Tom's way.  The back door swings open and Frankie 

emerges to help Tom in.  Like Tic-Tac, Frankie looks a little 

worked over.


Tom quickly sizes up the situation and decides to comply.


INT. CAR


As Tom sits into the back, next to Bluepoint.  Frankie slides 

in after him.


BLUEPOINT

How'd you get the fat lip?


The car starts moving.


TOM

Old war wound.  Acts up around morons.


BLUEPOINT

Very smart.  What were you doing at 

the club?  Talking things over with 

Leo?


TOM

Don't think so hard, Bluepoint, you 

might sprain something.


BLUEPOINT

You're so goddamn smart.  Except you 

ain't.  I get you, smart guy, I know 

what you are.  Straight as a 

corkscrew.  Mr. Inside-Outsky.  Like 

a goddamn bolshevik, picking up your 

orders from Yegg Central.  You think 

you're so goddamn smart.


He sneers:


BLUEPOINT

You joined up with Caspar.  You bumped 

Bernie Bernheim.  Down is up.  Black 

is white.  Well I think you're half-

smart.  I think you were straight 

with your frail and queer with Johnny 

Caspar.  And I think you'd sooner 

join the Ladies' League then gun a 

guy down.


His eyes narrow at Tom.


BLUEPOINT

...Then I hear that these two geniuses 

never even saw this rub-out take 

place.


Defensively:


TIC-TAC

The boss just said have him do it, 

he didn't say nothing about--


BLUEPOINT

Shutup, or maybe you still got too 

many teeth.


Tic-Tac sulks.  Bluepoint turns and gazes out the window of 

the car.


BLUEPOINT

...Everyone's so goddamn smart.  

Well, we'll go to Miller's Crossing.  

And we'll see who's smart.


EXT. WOODS


It is morning; the sun is now fully up.  Bluepoint and Tom 

walk side-by-side through the woods.  Frankie and Tic-Tac 

walk several steps ahead of them, each off to one side, 

searching.  Frankie is singing an old Neapolitan song.


BLUEPOINT

Y'understand if we don't find a stiff 

out here, we leave a fresh one.


Tom walks a little unsteadily.  His shoulders are hunched 

and his hands are jammed into his overcoat packets.  He stares 

woodenly forward.  Bluepoint laughs softly.


BLUEPOINT

...Where're your friends when you 

need 'em, huh?  Where's Leo now?


Tom tramps mechanically on.  His eyes drift up.


HIS POV


Tracking.  A canopy of leaves, sprinkled by sunlight.  The 

boughs of the trees sough quietly in the wind.


We hear the unearthly groaning of the tree limbs.


TOM


Looks forward.


Bluepoint calls out:


BLUEPOINT

Hey Tic-Tac, ever notice how the 

snappy dialogue dries up once a guy 

starts soiling his union suit?


Tom tramps on.


HIS POV


The backs of Frankie and Tic-Tac as they walk on ahead.


Frankie is still singing.


TOM


He looks stupidly at Bluepoint.  He looks ahead.


He stops abruptly.


BLUEPOINT

What?


Tom is still for a moment, then with jerky movements gets 

down on his knees, hugs a tree with one arm for support, and 

vomits.


Bluepoint watches him, then calls out to Frankie and Tic-

Tac:


BLUEPOINT

...Okay, there's nothing out here.


He grabs Tom's hat off his head and flings it away.  Then he 

plants a foot against Tom's side and shoves him to the ground.


CLOSE ON TOM


As his face hits the ground.


Bluepoint's foot enters; he plants it an the side of Tom's 

neck to keep him pinned.


TOM'S POV


Skewed angle, from the ground.


Frankie is ambling back, singing.


BLUEPOINT


Checking the open chamber of his gun.  He snaps it shut.


As he levels the gun at Tom:


BLUEPOINT

Think about this, smart guy.


TOM


Closing his eyes.


From offscreen:


TIC-TAC

Uh-oh, hankie time!


FRANKIE


He stops singing and turns to look.


TOM


The foot comes off his neck.


BLUEPOINT


Looking towards Tic-Tac.


TIC-TAC


Taking a handkerchief out of his breast pocket and bringing 

it to his face as he looks at something on the ground in 

front of him.


BLUEPOINT


He hauls Tom to his feet and pushes him towards Tic-Tac.


We track behind the two men as they approach Tic-Tac and 

Frankie enters from the side.


We cannot yet see what is on the ground in front of him.


TIC-TAC

Birds been at him.


Frankie is taking out his hankie as he draws near.


FRANKIE

Jesus Christ...


He looks up at Tom as Tom approaches.


Over Tom and Bluepoint's shoulders, stretching away from us, 

face-up, is a body.  We cannot see much of its face; what we 

do see is pulp.


Tic-Tac is laughing, incredulously.


TIC-TAC

...I said put one in his brain, not 

in his stinking face...


EXTREME LONG SHOT


Four very small men in overcoats and fedoras, looking down 

at the ground; they are dwarfed by the surrounding trees.


Very faintly we can hear:


FRANKIE

I told you, Bluepoint, we heard two 

shots...


QUICK FADE OUT


CUT TO


APARTMENT BUILDING DOOR BUZZER


A beat-up panel in the building's entryway, listing tenants' 

names and apartments opposite a row of buttons.


A hand coasts along the names and stops at CLARENCE 

JOHNSON/4C, then moves away and presses two other buzzers on 

the fifth floor.


After a beat, we hear the front door buzz open.


FOURTH-FLOOR HALLWAY


Tom walks up to 4C, unpocketing a gun.  He gently tries the 

knob, which turns, and enters.


DROP'S APARTMENT


As Tom enters.


Drop Johnson is sitting at a table in the living room, which 

also serves as kitchen and dining room.  He is a large man 

with a thick neck, a low forehead, and rather vacant eyes.


He is looking up at Tom, a spoonful of cereal frozen halfway 

to his mouth, a folded-back newspaper in his other hand, 

opened to the funnies.


TOM

'Lo, Drop.  How're the Katzenjammers?


Uncomfortably:


DROP

'Lo, Tom.  What's the rumpus?


As he talks, Tom walks casually around the apartment, bumping 

open doors, sticking his head in each room.


TOM

Had any visitors?


Drop's head swivels to follow Tom around the room; aside 

from that he does not move.  He speaks cautiously:


DROP

No.


TOM

Not ever, Drop?


DROP

...Not lately.


Tom nods.


TOM

Then you must be happy to see me.


Drop doesn't respond.


TOM

...So you didn't see Bernie Bernheim, 

before he was shown across?


DROP

No.


TOM

...Seen him since?


Drop maintains a sullen silence.


Tom is picking up a hat from a clutter on top of a bureau.


TOM

One last question, Drop.  I hear 

you've got a lot of money on 

tomorrow's fight.  Is that your bet, 

or did you place it for a friend?


DROP

No, uh... it's my bet.  I just... I 

have a good feeling about that 

fight...


Tom's stroll through the apartment has brought him behind 

where Drop sits.


TOM

A good feeling, huh.  When did the 

feeling return to your head?


DROP

...Huh?


Tom puts the hat on top of Drop's head.  Drop's eyes roll up 

to look at it, but otherwise he still doesn't move.


The hat, too small, sits ludicrously atop his head.


Tom starts toward the door.


TOM

You've outgrown that one.  Must be 

all the thinking you've been doing...


He pauses with his hand on the knob.


TOM

...Tell Bernie something's come up.  

He has to get in touch.  There'll be 

nothing stirring 'til I talk to him.


He slams the door.


CUT TO


A LARGE WINDOW


We are looking at the ground-floor window from the street.  

Letters stenciled on the glass identify the SONS OF ERIN 

SOCIAL CLUB.


A topcoated man scurries into frame, knocks out a pane with 

the grip of a gun, and tosses a small pipelike device inside.  

He scurries away and we pan with him across the street to 

reveal a line of cars, police and civilian, parked along the 

far curb.  No men are visible except the scurrying man, who 

takes cover behind one of the parked cars.


SOCIAL CLUB


A beat.


From inside we hear a pair of trotting footsteps--


BOOM!  The window blows out, spitting glass into the street, 

along with a large dark form.


THE STREET


Glass showers the pavement and a charred rag-doll of a body 

hits hard, face down, and skids a couple feet.  Smoke wisps 

from it.


THE CLUB


A lick of flame from the bomb is already dying and heavy 

grey smoke is billowing out.


THE STREET


Men start cautiously rising from behind the cars.  A lot of 

men.  Some wear police uniforms; some are civilians.  All 

are armed.


THE CLUB


Billowing smoke.


THE STREET


The men have straightened up.  A policeman calls through a 

bullhorn:


POLICEMAN

All right.  Anyone left in there, 

come on out, grabbing air.  You know 

the drill.


THE CLUB


After a beat, the front door swings open.  A man emerges, 

one hand in the air, one holding a handkerchief over his 

mouth.


He walks into the middle of the street.


One of the civilians behind the cars fires.


The man takes the bullet in the chest and drops to the ground, 

where he twitches.


The man who fired, in the foreground, grins.  A ripple of 

laughter runs down the line of men.


THE CLUB WINDOW


Smoke still pouring out.


With a RAT-A-TAT-TAT muzzle flashes from inside illuminate 

the smoke.


THE STREET


Bullet hits chew up the cars and a few of the men; the others 

drop back down behind the cars and start returning fire.


THE WINDOW


A forbidding black hole in the exterior wall.  A second tommy 

has joined the first to pour lead out into the street.


CUT TO


RECEPTION AREA


Tracking in an a youngish secretary in a severe dress, sitting 

behind a desk.


Faintly, from a distance, we can still hear gunfire.


SECRETARY

'Lo, Tom, where've you been hiding?


REVERSE ON TOM.


TOM

Hither and yon.  The mayor in?


SECRETARY

With Mr. Caspar.


Tom is already heading for the door.


TOM

That's who I'm looking for.  Scare 

up some hootch, will you honey?


SECRETARY

Surely.  I'll announce you.


As he opens the door:


TOM

Don't bother, I'm well liked.


INT. MAYOR'S OFFICE


A grand, high-ceilinged place.  Mayor Levander sits behind 

his desk sputtering, his face turning purple.  Caspar, sitting 

across from him, is also turning purple.  Sitting to one 

side are two identical thirty-year-old men, apparently twins, 

mustached, silent, respectful, mournful, their hands clasped 

over the hats in their laps, wearing stiff new-looking suits 

with old-fashioned collars.


MAYOR

I can't do it, Johnny!  I'll look 

ridiculous!  Why, it simply isn't 

done!  Assistants, maybe--


CASPAR

For a mayor, you don't hear so hot!  

I said head!  Head of the assessor's 

office!


MAYOR

But there's two of 'em!


CASPAR

I can count!  Co-heads!


MAYOR

Johnny, needless to say, this office 

will do anything in its power to 

assist you and your cousins.  We did 

it for Leo, of course, on countless 

occasions--


CASPAR

Damn right--had every potato eater 

from County Cork on the public tit--


MAYOR

But there's a way we do things, 

hallowed by usage and consecrated by 

time!  When we put people on the 

pad, when Leo was running things, we--


Caspar is furious:


CASPAR

Leo ain't running things!  I ain't 

innarested in ancient history!  I'm 

running things now!


MAYOR

Johnny, no one appreciates that more 

than I!  I can give them jobs!  I 

can give them good jobs!  I can even 

give them jobs where they won't have 

to perform any work, where their 

lack of English will be no impediment!  

But I can't--


CASPAR

What is this, the high hat?!


The mayor mops his face with a handkerchief and looks 

beseechingly at Tom.


MAYOR

Tom, can you explain it to him?  I 

can put them in public works but I 

can't--


TOM

You can do whatever the hell Caspar 

tells you.  I don't remember all 

this double-talk when Leo gave you 

an order.


The mayor looks flabbergasted.


MAYOR

Tom!  Jesus!


TOM

Stop whimpering and do as you're 

told.


CASPAR

You can start by gettin' outta here.


MAYOR

But Johnny, it's my office!


CASPAR

Get outta here!  Take it on the heel 

and toe, before I whack you one!...


The mayor retreats and Caspar stares at the two men sitting 

to the side.


CASPAR

...You too, beat it!


The two men look at each other, then back at Caspar.


FIRST MAN

...Partiamo?


CASPAR

Yeah, go keep the mayor company.  

I'll take care of ya's later.


The immigrants rise and leave the room.  Caspar takes out a 

handkerchief and wipes his brow.


CASPAR

...Runnin' things.  It ain't all 

gravy.


The secretary enters the office with a bottle of whiskey, a 

soda siphon and ice.  She places it an the mayor's desk and 

leaves.


We can still hear faint gunfire and an occasional booming 

explosion that rattles the windows of the office.


TOM

What's the fireworks?


CASPAR

Knockin' over one of Leo's clubs.  

Sonofabitch just won't go belly-up... 

I'm sorry, kid.  I heard about your 

little ride this morning.


Tom is walking over to pour himself a drink.


TOM

Yeah, well sorry don't fix things.  

We could just as easily've missed 

Bernie's corpse as stumbled over it, 

and I'd be dead now.


CASPAR

I know, I know.  But it don't mean 

Bluepoint's up to anything.  So he 

heard some rumor Bernie ain't dead, 

those stories pop up, people seen 

Dillinger in eight states last week.  

So he hears a story, and he don't 

like you much anyway, so he decides 

to check it out--


TOM

Any stories about Bernie being alive, 

Bluepoint's made up himself.


CASPAR

Aw, you don't know that.  It don't 

even make sense--why would he?


Tom stares at Caspar for a beat.


TOM

...There could be a damn good 

reason...


Caspar squints at Tom.


TOM

...If you've got a fixed fight coming 

up.  Do you?


CASPAR

...Maybe.  Okay, yeah, sure.  Tomorrow 

night, the fix is in.  What of it?


TOM

Bluepoint knows about it?


CASPAR

Yeah...


He gazes off.


CASPAR

...Okay, I get it.


TOM

If Bluepoint's been selling you out 

on these fights, and means to again, 

he'll have to be able to point the 

finger at someone else--


Uncomfortably:


CASPAR

Yeah, yeah, I get it.


TOM

--but with Bernie dead there ain't a 

hell of a lot of people he can point 

to.


CASPAR

Yeah.  Bluepoint sells me out.  Makes 

pretend Bernie's still doin' it.  

Ats real pretty.  Bernie leaked the 

fix, and you take the fall for 

supposedly not killing him...


He leans back in the mayor's chair and gazes off, sucking 

his lips in and out as he thinks.


Finally:


CASPAR

...But I dunno, why would Bluepoint 

cross me like that?  Money, okay, 

everybody likes money.  But somehow 

it don't seem like him.  And I know 

the Bluepoint.


TOM

Nobody knows anybody.  Not that well.


Caspar shakes his head.


CASPAR

Money don't mean that much to him.


Tom shrugs.


TOM

Then it's not just money he's after.  

He's got a wart on his fanny.


CASPAR

...Huh?


TOM

A wart.  On his fanny.  Giving him 

the fidgets.  Maybe he's sick of 

sitting on the couch and maybe behind 

your desk don't look like a bad place 

to move to.  Maybe he figures the 

money can help move him there.


Caspar studies Tom.


CASPAR

...Kid, you got a lip on ya.


He looks off again.


CASPAR

...I don't generally care for it.  

But you're honest, and that's 

something we can't get enough of in 

this business... I'll admit, since 

last we jawed, my stomach's been 

seazin' up on me.  Bluepoint saying 

we should double-cross you; you double-

cross once, where's it all end?  An 

innaresting ethical question.  I'll 

find Bluepoint, talk to him, 

straighten it out--


Tom laughs bitterly.


TOM

Sure, talk to him.  Have a chat.  

Ask him whether he's selling you 

out.  Don't take care of him before 

he makes his next move, just sit 

back and let him make it.  You're 

swimmin' in it.


Caspar's eyes flash.  Tom's tone softens:


TOM

...Johnny, my chin's hanging out 

right along side yours.


Caspar goes slack.


CASPAR

Yeah.


Tom stands up.


TOM

...I'd worry a lot less if I thought 

you were worrying enough.


Caspar, miserable, rubs his face.  From the distant street, 

we hear another booming explosion.


CASPAR

...But I am, kid... Christ... running 

things...


CUT TO


TOM'S APARTMENT


The phone is ringing at the cut.


We are looking at the window sill upon which the phone sits, 

with an empty chair facing.


Footsteps approach and Tom sits into frame and takes the 

phone.


TOM

Yeah?


Through the phone:


VOICE

I got your message.


TOM

'Lo, Bernie, I had a dream about you 

the other day.


We hear Bernie laugh.


BERNIE

...Yeah?  A nightmare?


TOM

On the contrary; very sweet.  I dreamt 

you were lying out at Miller's 

Crossing with your face blown off.


More laughter.


BERNIE

...You get a kick out of that?


TOM

I was in stitches.  It's Mink, isn't 

it?


BERNIE

I came back and he wasn't happy to 

see me.  Can you beat that, Tom?  

All he could talk about was how he 

had to skip, and how much trouble 

he'd be in if anyone found me at his 

place.


TOM

Some friend.


BERNIE

Yeah.  And you know what a nervous 

boy he was.  I figured, hell, you're 

a friend.  Maybe you could use some 

insurance.


TOM

That's you to the gills, Bernie: 

thoughtful.  You didn't happen to 

keep his gun, did you?


After a moment's hesitation:


TOM

...Didn't Mink have a .22?


BERNIE

He'd already ditched it.  Why?


Another hesitation:


TOM

...After Rug?


BERNIE

Yeah... How did you know?


Down to business:


TOM

Doesn't matter.  Listen, Bernie, 

I've been thinking about our little 

deal and I've decided you can stick 

it in your ear.


BERNIE

...Huh?


TOM

I figure you don't have anything on 

me that I don't have on you.  As a 

matter of fact, less, since I've 

decided to leave town. So I'm calling 

your bluff.


BERNIE

Wait a minute--


TOM

Shutup and let me talk.  I'm pulling 

out of here, tomorrow morning.  The 

only thing for you to decide is 

whether or not I leave behind a 

message for Caspar that you're still 

around.  If you want me to keep my 

mouth shut, it'll cost you some dough.


BERNIE

You can't--


TOM

I figure a thousand bucks is 

reasonable.  So I want two thousand.


BERNIE

In a pig's eye--


TOM

This isn't a debate, it's 

instructions.  I'm going out for a 

while; I'll be back here at four 

this morning.  Bring me the money.  

If you're not at my place, four 

o'clock, with the dough, Caspar'll 

be looking for you tomorrow.


He hangs up.


CUT TO


HALLWAY


We are close on Tom as, in overcoat and hat, he emerges from 

his apartment and looks down at the keys in his hand.


WHAP--A fist swings into frame to connect with Tom's cheek.  

He falls back.


Three topcoated men loom over him.


FIRST MAN

Got any money?


Tom is massaging his face.


TOM

...No.


The first man nods at the other two.


FIRST MAN

Okay.


The two men pick Tom off the floor and start to work him 

over.  He doesn't resist.


The first man watches dispassionately.


FIRST MAN

...Third race tonight.  By the finish, 

Tailor Maid had a view of the field.


He lights himself a cigarette.


FIRST MAN

...You oughta lay off the ponies, 

Tom.


The two men work in silence for a while.  Tom too is silent.


Finally:


FIRST MAN

...Okay.


The two men back away from Tom, breathing heavily.  He slides 

down the wall to the floor.


FIRST MAN

...Lazarre said he's sorry about 

this.  It's just getting out of hand.


Tom speaks thickly, his head propped against the baseboard:


TOM

...Yeah.


FIRST MAN

He likes you, Tom.  He said we didn't 

have to break anything.


TOM

Yeah.  Okay... Tell him no hard 

feelings.


FIRST MAN

Christ, Tom, he knows that.


With a jerk of the head the first man signals the other two 

and the trio turns to leave.


FIRST MAN

...Take care now.


CUT TO


DOORWAY NIGHT


We are looking over Tom's shoulder as he waits in the rain 

in front of a large oak doorway with wrought-iron fretwork.  

At the cut we hear chimes dying, and the door swings open.


There is a grand foyer with a parquet floor, unsittable 

furniture and a large chandelier.  A liveried butler looks 

inquiringly out at Tom.


TOM

Tom Duchaisne.


BUTLER

Yes sir...


He steps back.


BUTLER

...Mr. Caspar is in the great room.


Tom is handing the butler his hat.


TOM

Swell.  Can you take this?


INT. FOYER


As Tom starts to shrug out of his coat, Caspar is crossing 

towards him.


CASPAR

Kid, what's the rumpus?


Caspar seems as unhappy as last time we saw him.


TOM

I got news.


CASPAR

Yeah, news at this end too.  My 

stomach's been seazin' up on me.


TOM

Mink just told me that he--


This has woken Caspar up:


CASPAR

You talked to Mink?!


TOM

Yeah, on the phone.  Bluepoint wants 

you to think he's disappeared, so 

you can't talk to him, but he's been 

right here in town.


CASPAR

You're sure it was Mink?


Tom shrugs.


TOM

See for yourself; he's coming to my 

place, four o'clock this morning.


Having handed the butler his coat and hat, Tom lets Caspar 

lead him towards a pair of double doors.


TOM

...He's afraid of a cross from 

Bluepoint.  He told me about the 

fix.  Says he'll sing for a couple 

grand skip money, tell us everyone 

involved...


Caspar opens one of the double doors, and we continue tracking 

behind the two men as they enter the trophy room.  The room 

has the low warm light of a men's club.  Outside the dark 

windows the rain sheets down.


Caspar sits in behind his desk and swivels away to poke 

morosely with a fire shovel at the blaze in the fireplace.  

In the foreground, back to us, Tom rests his knuckles an the 

desk to lean towards Caspar.


TOM

...But you better take care of 

Bluepoint right away.  Mink says if 

he comes after us its going to be 

tonight.


As he looks into the fire:


CASPAR

Leo's holed up at Whiskey Nick's 

dump.


Tom is momentarily taken aback.


TOM

...How d'you know?


Chuckle comes from behind.


REVERSE


On Tom.  In the background, Bluepoint is walking over to the 

door to the room to close it.


BLUEPOINT

That ain't all we know, smart guy.


He points with a nod towards the couch.


BLUEPOINT

...Recognize your playmate?


On the couch sits Drop Johnson.  Drop's face looks worked 

on, and is beaded over with sweat.


Having shut the door, Bluepoint is sauntering over to Tom.


BLUEPOINT

...Yeah.  You thought I'd quit.


He shakes his head.


BLUEPOINT

Huh-uh.  I followed you this 

afternoon.  And I wondered why 

Einstein would want to talk to a 

gorilla...


He is nose to nose with Tom, smiling at him.


BLUEPOINT

...So I grabbed the gorilla... And I 

beat it out of him.


He shrugs.


BLUEPOINT

...Give me a big guy, every time.  

They crack easy.  Not like you.


Tom holds Bluepoint's look.


TOM

Is there a point?  Or are you just 

brushing up on your small talk?


BLUEPOINT

I like that.  Cool under fire.  I'm 

impressed.


Very quickly he delivers two slaps--forehand and backhand.  

Tom's head rocks but he recovers to stare back at Bluepoint.


BLUEPOINT

...The gorilla didn't know whose 

stiff we found, but I can fill that 

in.  You killed Mink, you sonofabitch.


He grabs Tom by the lapels, swings him away from the desk, 

and lands a punch on his chin.


Tom stumbles backs.


Caspar has turned from the fireplace, watching the doings 

across the room.


Bluepoint moves towards Tom, breathing hard with anticipated 

pleasure.


BLUEPOINT

...Come here, bum.  I'm gonna send 

you to a deep dark place.  And I'm 

gonna have fun doing it.


Bluepoint's hand snakes out and grabs Tom by the front of 

the coat, hauling him close.  He slaps him savagely.


BLUEPOINT

...It was Mink, and by God I'll hear 

you say it!


TOM

Is this how you taught Drop his story?


In one motion Bluepoint's hands wrap around Tom's throat 

choking him off.  As the pressure increases, Tom, purpling, 

sinks to his knees.


BLUEPOINT

I like the way you think.  Maybe 

when you're dead I'll cut your head 

off, put it on my mantle--


WHANG--a shovel blade swings into frame to smash Bluepoint 

in the face.


He drops.


From somewhere in the room, a scream.


Bluepoint is on his hands and knees, one hand pressed over 

his ruined face, blood pouring from between the fingers.


CASPAR

Sonafabitch...


He stands over Bluepoint with the fireplace shovel.


CASPAR

...If there's one thing I can't stand, 

it's a double-cross artist.  I had a 

feeling 'bout this sonofabitch--


He swings the shovel back and delivers an overhand blow to 

the top of Bluepoint's head.


Bluepoint drops to the floor, instantly motionless.


The scream, however, continues.


Drop Johnson, on the couch, his eyes wide, his hands 

spastically squeezing his knees, is looking down at Bluepoint.  

Drop's mouth is stretched wide.  He is screaming.


Tom gets slowly to his feet.


Caspar looks at Drop.


CASPAR

...Shut it, you sonofabitch!


He is striding over to him with the shovel.


CASPAR

...I'll give you something to holler 

about!


Tom intercepts him.


TOM

Johnny.  It's okay.  Bluepoint made 

him.  It's okay.  It's not important.


Caspar is panting.


CASPAR

Then have him shut it!


Drop does.


There is a beat.


Incongruously, Caspar's bellow breaks the silence:


CASPAR

...And we do the same to Mink!  This 

very same night!


Another silence.  The rain.  The crackle of the fire.


Tom's tone is soothing:


TOM

...Johnny.  We can't double-cross 

him.  He wants to spill the whole 

set-up--


Caspar stares at him through glazed eyes.


CASPAR

I've never let a sonofabitch walk!


TOM

You've never crossed anyone...


Caspar is staring at him.  His eyes have lost some of their 

glaze.


TOM

...Four o'clock, my place.  Mink's 

coming in on his own hook so I 

promised him the money.  Don't make 

me out a liar--


Drop is suddenly screaming again.


Caspar looks where Drop is looking:


Bluepoint is raising his head, moaning.  His face is a mask 

of blood.  One hand gropes in his overcoat pocket for his 

gun.


Caspar shouts over Drop's howl as he pulls something from 

his desk drawer:


CASPAR

...Lookit this, kid.


He strides over to Bluepoint.


CASPAR

...Something I try and teach all my 

boys...


With the gun point blank against the back of Bluepoint's 

head, he fires.


Tom recoils.


CASPAR

...Always put one inna brain!


CLOCK


A large wall clock.  It is 3:30.


We are pulling back and down to reveal that we are inside a 

diner; we are isolating on a section of counter on which 

sits a half-empty cup of coffee and an ashtray half-filled 

with butts.  A hand puts some change on the counter and leaves 

frame.


EXT. DINER


As Tom pushes the door open and exits.  He tucks his overcoat 

collar up as he walks; it is pouring rain.


Tom turns at the sound of approaching heels and recognizes 

Verna with some surprise.  He glances up and down the street, 

but it is deserted.  Verna doesn't seem to much notice the 

rain.


TOM

'Lo, Verna.  What's the rumpus.


Coldly, as they walk on together:


VERNA

I was just in the neighborhood, 

feeling a little daffy.  What're you 

doing?


TOM

...Walking.


VERNA

Don't let on more than you have to.


TOM

In the rain.


Tom glances at her.


TOM

...What're you doing out?


VERNA

Bernie's dead, isn't he?


They walk on for a beat, Tom looking down at the sidewalk.  


Finally:


TOM

...What makes you think that?


VERNA

That's no answer.


Tom again glances around, and escorts Verna into a dark 

doorway alcove.  It is very small; they have to crowd into 

each other to stay out of the rain.  Water drops from the 

brim of Tom's fedora.  He studies her for a beat.


TOM

I can't tell you anything yet.


VERNA

Nobody cares, do they?  His friends 

didn't really like him.


Tom shrugs.


TOM

He didn't like his friends.


VERNA

You're a sonofabitch, Tom.  You're 

someone to talk.  You got me to tell 

you where he was and then you killed 

him.


She is raising a gun into frame: She presses it into his 

stomach.


Tom stiffens but continues to stare at her calmly.


VERNA

...Tell me why.  What was in it for 

you?


TOM

Nothing for me.


VERNA

Then why?


TOM

...Giving up Bernie was the only way 

I could see to straighten things out 

for Leo.


VERNA

You said you didn't care about Leo.


TOM

I said we were through.  It's not 

the same thing.


Verna looks at him.


VERNA

I don't understand.  I don't care.  

I don't care what reason you had or 

thought you had.


She raises the gun and presses its barrel into the under- 

side of Tom's chin.  Tom stiffens but remains calm.


TOM

...He's still alive.


Verna stares at him.


VERNA

You expect me to believe you?


TOM

...No.


VERNA

That's you all over, Tom.  A lie and 

no heart.


Verna pulls back the hammer.  There is a long beat.


Verna's eves widen, locked an Tom's.


Tom returns her look; his is sympathetic.


Verna starts trembling.


Tom's tone is soft, understanding.  It's the first time we 

have ever seen compassion from him.


TOM

...It isn't easy, is it Verna?


She abruptly lurches away and staggers a couple of paces 

onto the sidewalk in the rain.  She hugs a lamppost for


support.  She is staring down at the street, still trembling.


Tom walks up behind her and rests a hand an her shoulder.


TOM

...Are you all right?


She doesn't look around.  After a moment:


VERNA

...I don't know how you did it.


She shrugs off his hand and stumbles off down the street.


Tom watches her disappear into the rain.


CUT TO


TREE LIMBS


Night, but sometime later--it has stopped raining.  The 

branches groan in the wind.  As they sway, streetlight 

glitters off the leaves, still wet with rain..


We are booming down to reveal that we are in front of Tom's 

building, its windows dark.  During the boom we hear the 

rumble of an approaching car and the hiss of its tires on 

wet asphalt.


The boom down ends as the car pulls into frame to stop at 

the curb with the camera framed on the driver's window.  The 

driver has a small bandage on his left cheek.  We hear 

Caspar's voice as we hear him getting out the back:


CASPAR

Ya put the razor in cold water, not 

hot--'cause metal does what in cold?


DRIVER

I dunno, Johnny.


We hear the back door slam and Caspar appears in the front 

passenger window.


CASPAR

...'Ats what I'm tellin' ya. It 

contracts. 'At way you get a first 

class shave.


DRIVER

Okay, Johnny.


As Caspar walks off the driver slouches back, pulls his fedora 

over his eyes and folds his arms across his chest.  A back 

enters frame in the foreground.


TOM'S VOICE

'Lo, Sal.  You can dangle.


The driver looks up, startled.


DRIVER

'Lo, Tom.  You sure?  You don't look 

so hot.


We still don't see Tom's face.


TOM

I'm okay.  Go ahead, I'll drive him 

home.


The driver shrugs.


REVERSE


Wider, from the other side of the car, as the car pulls away.


Tom walks into the foreground, toward his house; we tilt up 

to hold him.


The low-angle shows us the tree behind Tom, its branches 

still creaking in the wind.


CRACK CRACK--we hear two gunshots from inside the house.


Tom stops momentarily in close shot, looking up, and then 

continues on out of frame.


OVER TOM'S SHOULDER


We follow him as he walks into the building and slowly down 

the first-floor hall.


The hallway is quiet except for a light moaning wind.


Beyond Tom we see the door to the first-floor apartment crack 

open a slit.


Hissing:


VOICE

Mr. Duchaisne...


The door opens wider.  Mrs. Zarpas, wearing a housecoat, her 

gray hair down in braids, sticks her head out.


MRS. ZARPAS

...There were shots.


Tom looks up towards the staircase, then back at Mrs. Zarpas.


TOM

Go down to the drugstore.  Call the 

police.


She stares at him, nods.  As she drapes on a raincoat:


MRS. ZARPAS

Yes, Mr. Duchaisne.


TOM

You better stay there 'til the 

officers arrive.


MRS. ZARPAS

Yes...


She pauses.


MRS. ZARPAS

...Will the cats be all right here?


Tom stares at her.


Finally, he nods.


TOM

...They'll be fine.


Mrs. Zarpas returns his dazed nod, and shuffles away.


So far, upstairs, all is quiet.


PULLING TOM


As he starts slowly towards the staircase.


TOM'S POV TRACKING FORWARD


A small black object on the staircase--an upside-down fedora.  

Blood drips with a hollow rattle down onto a step, a couple 

steps above the hat.


PULLING TOM


He looks up.


POV


A head sticks through the balusters of the second story 

landing return.  The body is on its back; the head lolls 

back over the tip of the landing down towards the staircase.


Our climbing low angle shows us mostly the back of the head.  

The body's far shoulder has knocked out a baluster whose 

splintered bottom juts down towards the stairs.


PULLING TOM


Still climbing, looking at the body.


HIS POV


Climbing and panning as we draw even with the head.


It is Caspar.  Blood has been expelled through his nostrils 

over his mouth and chin.  His face is deep red.  His eyes 

stare glassily at Tom.


PULLING TOM


As he reaches the top of the stairs and swings around to 

face along the landing.  We hear a chuckle, close by.  Wind 

is groaning through the hallway.


POV


In the middle foreground Caspar lies an the floor; beyond 

him, Bernie leans against the doorframe in Tom's open doorway, 

smiling, his arms folded over his chest.


The balusters stretch away in a regular line, throwing 

vertical shadows upwards against the opposite wall.


BERNIE

I get it.  You set me up.


Tom leans against the wall and looks morosely down at Caspar.


BERNIE

...Anything to avoid a little dirty 

work yourself, huh?


Tom doesn't answer.


BERNIE

...How'd you know he'd get it and 

not me?  Or didn't you care?


Tom shrugs, still staring down at Caspar.


TOM

I figured you'd come early, and be 

looking for blood.  He wouldn't, so 

you'd likely have the drop on him.


Bernie takes his gun out of his overcoat packet and saunters 

over.


BERNIE

You're a sonofabitch, Tom.  I like 

the way you think.  You're right, 

the bonehead never knew what hit 

him.


He looks down at Caspar, unable to suppress a smile.


BERNIE

...But if you knew I'd come looking 

to kill you, how do you know I won't 

still?


Tom shrugs again.


TOM

Nothing in it for you, now.  With 

him dead we got nothing on each other.  

Let me have the gun.


BERNIE

Why?


Tom jerks his head towards Caspar.


TOM

Pin this on Bluepoint.  Neither of 

us wants him walking around after 

this.


Bernie shakes his head.


BERNIE

The cops'll be Leo's now.  They won't 

care what they hang Bluepoint for.


Tom shrugs again.


TOM

I guess that's so.  If you don't 

mind keeping the gun that killed 

Caspar.  And Mink.


He stoops down over Caspar's body and starts feeling through 

Caspar's pockets, looking for something.


TOM

...Why did Mink shoot Rug, anyway?


Bernie is walking towards him, emptying the bullets from his 

gun.


BERNIE

I dunno, it was just a mix-up.  Here.


Tom looks back over his shoulder.  Bernie hands him the gun, 

which Tom slips into his overcoat packet.


BERNIE

...So you're gonna say Bluepoint did 

this?


As he goes back to the body:


TOM

Mink thought Rug was tailing him?


He finds Caspar's gun and sets it on the floor, but keeps 

looking.


BERNIE

Yeah yeah, you know Mink.  Hysterical.  

Skin full of hop, head full of 

bogeymen.  Comes home crying one 

day, said he had to pop a guy, one 

of Bluepoint's spies.


TOM

Rug was following Verna, not Mink.  

Mink just happened to be with her.


He has found a wallet and is thumbing through it.


BERNIE

Yeah.  Funny, ain't it?  But you 

know, Mink was terrified Bluepoint'd 

find out me and him were jungled up 

together.


Tom has taken out the money, rifles it, and replaces the 

wallet.


TOM

And I'll bet you'd kept him plenty 

worried about that, to keep him under 

your thumb.


BERNIE

Yeah, so what...


Bernie is peering over Tom's shoulder at the money.


BERNIE

...Scratch, huh?  A little bonus?


Tom straightens up, Caspar's gun in hand.


TOM

Why did Mink take Rug's hair?


Bernie shrugs.


BERNIE

Beats me, the kid was dizzy.  Fifty-

fifty on the dough?  Or maybe I should 

get a little more, since I did the 

deed.


Tom is stuffing the money into his pocket.


BERNIE

...Okay, you keep it.  I want you to 

have it.


TOM

Bernie...


He nods towards Caspar's body.


TOM

...We can't hang this on Bluepoint.


BERNIE

Huh?  Why not?


TOM

Bluepoint's already dead, halfway 

'cross town.


Bernie's smile is fading.


BERNIE

What the hell are you talking about?


TOM

Bluepoint's dead.  It's gotta be 

you.  I mean hell, it's your gun.


Alarm is beginning to rise:


BERNIE

What is this!  What the hell are you 

talking about!...


He looks down at Caspar and then back at Tom.


BERNIE

...You took my gun!  Just your word 

against mine!


Tom pops the chamber of Caspar's gun, glances in, and snaps 

it shut.


TOM

Not necessarily.


Bernie's eyes widen.


BERNIE

Are you crazy!  We're square!  You 

said it yourself!  We got nothing on 

each other!


TOM

Yup.


Bernie fights against hysteria:


BERNIE

So what's in it for you?!  There's 

no angle!  You can't just shoot me, 

like that!


He sinks to his knees, his voice rising.


BERNIE

...Jesus Christ!  It don't make sense!  

Tommy!  Look in your heart!


TOM

What heart.


BANG--Bernie splays backwards from the knees, a bullet drilled 

neatly through his forehead.


Tom drops the gun by Caspar's body.


Unpocketing Bernie's gun, Tom goes over to his corpse and 

drops it there.


We pan with Tom's legs to bring his doorway into view as he 

walks into his apartment, to the window chair in the 

background, and sits with his back to us.


The windows show daylight breaking.  Far away a clock strikes 

the quarter hour.


Tom is picking up the phone and dialing.  Waiting for an 

answer, he reaches over to turn off the feeble yellow lamp 

burning chairside.


As we start to FADE OUT, we can hear Tom talking into the 

phone:


TOM

...Tony?  Tom.  Tell Lazarre I've 

got his money... Yeah, all of it.  

And I want to place a bet on tonight's 

fight...


BEAT OF BLACK


CUT TO 


THE HALLWAY


Of Leo's club, leading to his office.


We are tracking over Tom's shoulder as he walks down the 

hall, led by Dead Terry.


TERRY

They set you up downstairs?


TOM

How's that?


TERRY

Hootch?  Whatever?


Tom gestures with the drink he is carrying.  Its ice cubes 

clink.


TERRY

...Well thanks for coming, Tom.  

Leo's real anxious to see you...


TOM

Yeah.  I happened to be near.


We can hear muffled bellowing coming from Leo's office, 

growing louder as we approach.


Terry seems embarassed:


TERRY

Actually... this might not be the 

best time...


They have pulled up in front of the closed door to Leo's 

office.


Leo's bellowing, inside, abates for a moment.  We can hear 

another voice, muffled so that we don't hear words, but only 

the voice's plaintive quality.


Leo's bellowing cuts it short.


TOM

...Who's he got in there?


TERRY

O'Gar and the mayor.


As he leaves frame:


TOM

I'll try again.


Terry calls after him:


TERRY

I'll tell him you stopped by.


DOWNSTATRS


Pulling Tom as he walks across the gambling floor, drink 

still in hand.


Behind him we can see workmen busily repairing the damage 

done to the club in the police raid.


Halfway across the floor Tom stiffens and slows, seeing 

something.


Verna is entering the club.


The two meet.


TOM

'Lo, Verna.


VERNA

See Leo?


They both lean against a countertop and look out at the floor.


TOM

He was busy.


VERNA

You should see him.  He has something 

to tell you.


TOM

Maybe I'll run into him.


VERNA

Bernie's funeral is tomorrow.  You 

could stop by.


TOM

Maybe.


VERNA

...Leo has something to tell you.


TOM

So you said.


There is a silent beat.  Verna scowls.


VERNA

...Tell me something, Tom.  Why didn't 

you tell me what was going on?  I 

thought he was dead, and you never--


TOM

There was no point in telling you.  

It could only have queered things if 

it had gotten out--


VERNA

Jesus, Tom!  You don't just talk to 

people for the play it gives you or 

doesn't give you!  I suffered, you 

no-heart son of a bitch!


Tom lets this drift.


Verna tries to compose herself.


VERNA

...I'm sorry.  It's just that things 

might've been different.  With us.  

If I'd known that you hadn't... done 

anything to him...


TOM

You know now.


Verna looks at him intently.


VERNA

What happened that night?


Tom still looks at her evenly.


TOM

I went to a bar.  Passed out.  When 

I got back to my place they were 

both dead.


Verna studies him.


VERNA

...Passed out, huh?


TOM

Yeah.


She looks at him a beat more, then out at the floor.


VERNA

It's funny... I've never even seen 

you sleep--though you told me once 

about a dream you had.


TOM

Maybe I lied.


WHAP!  Verna slaps him hard.  His head rocks under the blow.


VERNA

You've never been straight with me 

about anything!  You are a 

sonofabitch!


She stalks off.


Tom watches her go.


He raises the drink and rolls it across his slapped cheek.


The ice cubes clink.


CEMETERY


An small old marble orchard set on a hilltop cleared against 

the woods.  Stars of David adorn the headstones; in the 

foreground Bernie's funeral is ending.  Present is a rabbi, 

just finishing the chanting of the liturgy, Verna, and Leo.


In the background, on the road at the foot of the hill, Tom 

is emerging from a taxi.  It rolls away as he starts up the 

hill.


Just as he arrives, Leo and Verna turn to leave.


Tom takes in the scene.


TOM

Big turnout.


VERNA

Drop dead.


She stalks off, leaving Leo and Tom alone.  Leo takes off 

his yarmulke and fiddles with it uncomfortably.  The two men 

start walking.


LEO

...She's under a lot of strain.


TOM

Well, at least she didn't hit me.


Leo chuckles.


They walk on.


LEO

Tommy, I'm glad you came...


TOM

She's taking the car.


LEO

Huh?


Leo looks up.


Verna is getting into the elegant black touring-car that 

waits at the bottom of the hill.  It pulls away.


Leo looks at Tom.


LEO

...I guess we're walking.


TOM

I guess we are.


They walk in silence for a beat.


LEO

...We're getting married.


Tom stiffens.  He brings out:


TOM

...Congratulations, Leo.


Leo too is uncomfortable.


LEO

The funny thing is... She asked me.  

To tie the knot.  I guess you're not 

supposed to say that.


TOM

It doesn't matter.  Congratulations.


LEO

Thanks... Hell, Tom!  Why didn't you 

tell me what you were up to?!  I 

thought you'd really gone over--not 

that I didn't deserve it.  But you 

could have told me.


TOM

Telling you could only've queered 

things if it had...


Tom cuts himself off and walks in silence for a moment.


TOM

...There just wasn't any point.


Leo wants to be encouraging.  He nods.


LEO

I can see that.  Well.  It was a 

smart play, all around.  I guess you 

know I'm grateful.


TOM

No need.


Leo is grinning again.


LEO

I guess you picked that fight with 

me just to tuck yourself in with 

Caspar.


TOM

I dunno.  Do you always know why you 

do things, Leo?


Leo greets this with a puzzled Smile.


LEO

Course I do.


He nods to himself.


LEO

...It was a smart play.


They walk on.


TOM

You'll do fine.


Leo stops, grabs Tom's arm, and the words come cut in a rush:


LEO

...Jesus, Tom!  I'd give anything if 

you'd work for me again!  I know 

I've made some bonehead plays!  I 

know I can be pig-headed but, damnit, 

so can you!  I need your help, and 

things can be like they were, I know 

it!  I just know it!  As for you and 

Verna--well I understand, you're 

both young, and--well, damnit, Tom, 

I forgive you!


Tom instantly bristles.  For the first time, his tone is 

sharp:


TOM

I didn't ask for that and I don't 

want it.


The two men stare at each other--Tom's look angry; Leo's, 

distraught.


Tom's look softens.


TOM

...Goodbye, Leo.


Leo still stares at him, waiting for something else.


When nothing is forthcoming he turns and walks away.


Tom watches him go.  He unpockets a flask and raises it to 

his lips.


Behind him a tree soughs in the wind.


FADE OUT
