"SUSPECT ZERO"


Screenplay by


Paul Schrader


1998 Draft Script


UNPRODUCED




CREDITS


Intercut male faces from all around America: mostly white, 

mostly 20-35. These are the killers in our midst.


Varying film stocks and formats: video, telephoto, digitized -- 

some anecdotal, some subliminal.


Over the images a montage of speech synthesized voices from 

Internet chat rooms: "Got a nice package," "...the look in 

her eyes -- the wild look that says please, I'll do anything," 

"Friday is my day," "item's fingernails had cyanotic hue," 

"nylon sports pants," "screaming like a little piggie."


END CREDITS


EXT. NUEVO AMERICAN DINER MAGIC HOUR


A gas station/diner combo on a deserted stretch of US 54. 

Bluish fluorescents over the pumps contrast with incandescent 

light from within the diner interior. Cars and pickups with 

Texas and New Mexico plates and bumper stickers ("I'm Texican 

and Proud of It") parked outside.


CUT TO:


INT. NUEVO AMERICAN MAGIC HOUR


HAROLD SPECK, 35, a fleshy man in a tired brown suit, sits 

in an orange vinyl booth sipping coffee, poking at a piece 

of coffee cake. A large salesman's case rests on the seat 

beside him.


Harold's POV: JANITA, a thirtiesh waitress stands by the 

cash register, looks at her watch, looks at the clock (7:30), 

looks back at her watch. An older couple sits in a booth 

away from Speck; a solo trucker at the counter motions to 

Janita. She refills his coffee.


A poster, "Rattlesnakes of the Southwest," hangs beside 

community notices and "For Sale" advertisements.


A slouching man, 45-55, wearing soiled Sears work clothes 

and an orange hard hat, slips into the seat across from Speck. 

At the moment his name is unknown to us; later we will 

discover he is RICHARD LOW.


Harold looks up, startled:


HAROLD

Jesus.


LOW

Hi. What's in the case?


Speck glances around; there are plenty of open tables.


HAROLD

You... surprised me.


LOW

Sorry. I've seen you in here. Always 

lugging that case around.

(Harold nods)

Whatja sell?


HAROLD

Ah... restaurant supplies. I didn't 

get your name.


LOW

You must travel a lot, huh?


HAROLD

Yeah.


LOW

Whole country or just hereabouts?


HAROLD

I don't mean to be rude, but...


LOW

Just gettin' a jolt of java before 

headin' on home?

(beat)

How does your wife feel about it?


HAROLD

What?


LOW

About your being away all the time. 

Must get lonely.


HAROLD

Look...


LOW

You must get lonely. You ever think 

about, you know...

(winks)


HAROLD

Excuse me?


LOW

You know, you ever think about other 

women?


Talking, Low reaches into his right pocket, pulls out 3x5 

photographs, places them on the table. Low's fingertips have 

a waxy sheen.


HAROLD

What are you...?


LOW

Fucking. I'm talking about fucking, 

Harold. You ever think of fucking 

other women?


Speck, fixed on the photos of naked women, glances up at the 

sound of his name: how did he know that?


HAROLD

Look, mister...


LOW

Take a look, Harold. Tell me if you 

see anything you want. You do like 

to look, don't you?


Low points to a particularly explicit photo, all the while 

reaching with his other hand into his left pocket.


LOW

You like? If not, I've got these.


Low places a second collection of snapshots on the table. 

The top picture, difficult to make out, shows something far 

more graphic than the others. Speck goes white:


HAROLD

My God.


LOW

Not bad, huh?


HAROLD

(eyes on photos)

You're a... you're sick.


LOW

What's wrong with me?


Low reaches for Speck's hand. Harold, pulling his arm back, 

knocks over his coffee. Low quickly collects the pictures 

(one falls to the seat), gets up, walks out. Harold, turning 

his head, spots Janita.


She steps over, her eyes asking: "What's going on?"


HAROLD

(about coffee)

Sorry.

(looks back)

Could I have the check?


CUT TO:


EXT. NUEVO AMERICAN DINER MAGIC HOUR


Speck places his sales case into the front seat of a 1996 

Riviera, slides in beside, starts the car and drives off.


CUT TO:


INT. HAROLD'S CAR NIGHT


Speck, back on the highway, breathes a sigh of relief. 

Headlights hit a sign in the black landscape: "Texas Stateline 

2 Miles."


Harold, reaching for the radio dial, looks into the rear-

view mirror:


HAROLD

OhmyGod...


In the mirror: Richard Low, hard hat exchanged for a full 

head of graying hair, sits up in the back seat.


Harold involuntarily swerves the wheel; Low, reaching across 

Speck, steadies the car. He wears latex gloves.


LOW

Calm down, Harold.

(Harold catches breath)

Okay, here's what we're going to do, 

Harold: there's a pull off up ahead, 

we're going to stop there.


HAROLD

Oh God, mister, please leave me alone.


LOW

(glancing out window)

You're going to miss it. Pay 

attention.


HAROLD

What do you want from me?


Low reaches forward, grasps Harold's right eyelid between 

his thumb and forefinger.


LOW

How'd you like it if I tore off your 

eyelid, Harold?

(tugs at eyelid: Harold 

winces)

You can't blink, you gotta keep your 

eyes open all the time. You know how 

painful that is?

(beat)

Here's the rest stop. Pull over.


Harold, panic-stricken, obeys.


CUT TO:


EXT. TURN-AROUND NIGHT


The "rest stop" is little more than an extended shoulder. 

Speck pulls the Riviera to a stop, cuts the engine; the 

headlights go dark.


CUT TO:


INT. HAROLD'S CAR NIGHT


Harold's hand is on the headlight switch when he feels a 

nylon cord tighten around his neck. He tugs at it; Low chokes 

tighter.


LOW

Relax, Harold.


Speck does; Low loosens the garrote.


LOW

I've been looking for you.


HAROLD

Why me? What do you want from me!?


Low tightens the noose, leans into Harold's ear, whispers:


LOW

Murman.


Speck's eyes widen as he gasps for air.


CUT TO:


EXT. FEDERAL BLDG/EL PASO DAY


A seven-story red-brick and glass building on East San Antonio 

Avenue, home of the FBI Field Office.


CUT TO:


INT. FBI OFFICE DAY


The seventh floor elevator opens directly onto a large 

bullpen. The FBI seal is featured prominently on a wall 

leading to private offices.


THOMAS MACKELWAY, 28, sports jacket and tie, works at a 

computer terminal in one of a half-dozen cubicles. The Bureau 

is a button-down world, even in sun-drenched downtown El 

Paso, a half mile from Mexico.


The elevator opens: CHUCK SALINAS, 40, the Supervisory Agent 

in Charge, enters, carry-on bag over his shoulder. Seated 

agents look up, stop what they're doing. AGENT JOHN DUNCAN 

steps over:


DUNCAN

Welcome back, sir. How was the 

vacation?


SALINAS

Takes four days to chill, then its 

time to come back.

(looking around, spots 

Mack)

Is that...?


DUNCAN

Yeah.


Mack stands as Salinas approaches. His voice and demeanor 

reflect an East Coast upbringing:


MACKELWAY

Good morning, sir. Agent Salinas, 

sir.


SALINAS

So you're the new meat?


MACKELWAY

Yes, sir.


SALINAS

What did you do to end up here?


MACKELWAY

I believe it's in my file, sir.


SALINAS

(to Duncan)

Johnny, get this man's file. 

Mackelway, right?


MACKELWAY

Thomas Mackelway.


SALINAS

Hot enough for you, Agent Mackelway? 

Hell's doorknob. What they got you 

doing?


MACKELWAY

Updating the condition of all Bureau-

owned vehicles in the southwest 

sector, sir.


SALINAS

Sounds like fun.


Duncan hands him a manila file; Salinas opens it.


SALINAS

"Computer Investigation and 

Infrastructure Assessment Center." 

Quantico out of MIT -- you're a 

techie?

(Mack nods)

Okay, you screwed up once. So did 

half the guys here. That's why they're 

here.


MACKELWAY

I screwed up twice, sir.


SALINAS

I see that. Washington to Philadelphia 

to here. Philly's a nice station. 

How many agents?


MACKELWAY

Four hundred and sixty, sir.


SALINAS

"Attitude Adjustment Issues" -- what 

the fuck is that supposed to mean?


MACKELWAY

I wished to be reinstated at Computer 

Crimes. I was undiplomatic in my 

request.


SALINAS

(reading)

This is a first. You criticized the 

Deputy Director to his face and you 

still have a badge? You must have 

some one-of-a-kind skills.

(Mackelway doesn't 

answer)

Why don't you just quit? I mean, 

you're not going to get promoted, 

not wearing this jacket.


MACKELWAY

I like working for the Bureau, sir. 

I like catching bad guys. It's all I 

care about.


SALINAS

Jesus, just what I need, another 

blue flamer.

(turns to leave)

Johnny, get this boy some sun screen.


Salinas heads for his office. Mackelway, deflated, plops 

down in his chair.


CUT TO:


INT. MACK'S CUBICLE DAY


TIMECUT: a list of FBI 4-wheel Arizona plate vehicles scrolls 

on the screen.


Mackelway, bored, bored, bored, sips cold coffee, stretches 

his shoulders, takes notes. His jacket is hung over his chair, 

his sleeves rolled up. He glances at his watch.


Salinas enters the bullpen area, calls to Duncan:


SALINAS

Agent Duncan, there's an interstate 

issue up on 54, run out there.


DUNCAN

I'm babysitting the DEA guys this 

afternoon, Casio and I. You said 

that was top priority.


Salinas nods, looks around. He spots Mack's eager eyes. Mack, 

unrolling his sleeves, buttons his cuffs.


SALINAS

(calls)

Agent Mackelway, you want to get off 

your ass and do something for a 

change?


MACKELWAY

(stands)

Yes, sir.


SALINAS

(walks over)

Got a vehicle?

(Mack nods)

Head north on 54. When you get to 

New Mexico you've gone too far.


Mack takes his gun and shoulder holster out of a drawer as 

Salinas hands him a slip of paper.


SALINAS

And Mackelway, when you're dealing 

with the locals, talk slow.


CUT TO:


EXT. US 54 AFTERNOON


Mackelway drives his Bureau-issue sedan past stretches of 

sand and mobile homes. He fiddles with the radio dial, goes 

from one Spanish language station to a second, turns it off.


How did he end up here?


CUT TO:


EXT. TURN-AROUND AFTERNOON


The same "rest stop" as earlier, except now filled with 

Highway Patrol and Police cars from Texas and New Mexico.


Mack, flashing his FBI ID, walks to a cluster of cops. HARRY 

DYLAN, 50, wearing cowboy boots and hat, steps over:


DYLAN

Agent Mackelway? Salinas said he was 

sending someone new. Harry Dylan.

(they shake)

This is my county. This way...


They approach a tow truck backed up to an arroyo, passing, 

as they go, a sign reading "Welcome to New Mexico."


MACKELWAY

You run the plates?


DYLAN

Fella's name is Harold Speck, 

travelin' man out of Roswell.


MACKELWAY

Excuse me, a salesman gets done in 

his car and you call the FBI?


DYLAN

Well, the victim was killed at the 

turn-around over there, then his car 

was pushed over here...

(points to sign)

...right across the state line. That 

makes it Federal. This is Officer 

Wallace, he's out of Alamogordo.


Mack shakes hands with New Mexico State Trooper WALLACE, 

walks past the tow truck, looks into the steep ravine where 

Speck's Riviera rests balanced precariously on its front 

bumper. GRANGER, a New Mexico cop, sipping coffee from a 

take-out cup, steps onto the tire tracks. Mack motions him 

away; Granger doesn't budge.


MACKELWAY

Am I talking to myself? This is a 

crime scene.


Granger looks down, steps back.


MACKELWAY

Thank you.


Trooper Wallace turns to JUMBO, the heavy-set tow-truck 

operator:


WALLACE

All right, Jumbo, Feds are here.


The operator activates the winch.


MACKELWAY

Hold it, hold it!


Jumbo cuts off the winch. Mack removes his jacket, loosens 

his tie:


MACKELWAY

I'd better have a look.


Dylan turns to his fellow cops:


DYLAN

Sure. I wouldn't trust those rednecks 

either.


They snicker as Mackelway slips down the ravine.


SPECK'S CAR: in the bottom of the ravine, Mack, putting on 

latex gloves, climbs through the passenger window. He braces 

his foot against the dash, the force of which unbalances the 

car: it suddenly SLIPS.


Mack tumbles forward, BANGING the rear view mirror, CUTTING 

his forehead. Harold's body pitches forward against the 

steering wheel: the horn lets out a continuous BLEAT.


AT THE TOW TRUCK: Jumbo, dropping his coffee, grabs for the 

winch controls:


JUMBO

Shit!


Sheriff Dylan looks over the side:


DYLAN

You okay?


INSIDE SPECK'S CAR: Mackelway uprights himself, wipes blood 

from his forehead.


MACKELWAY

Yeah, I'm --


The horn blots out his voice. Mackelway would have stopped 

speaking in any case -- something has caught his attention. 

He gingerly pulls back Harold's head.


Dried blood streaks from Speck's eye -- his eyelids have 

been TORN OFF. His neck is striated by a black-and-blue welt.


MACKELWAY

Jesus.


Mack takes a deep breath, takes a quick look around. He spots 

pocket change and a slip of paper by Harold's feet. Reaching 

down, Mack retrieves it: it's a receipt from the Nuevo 

American Diner.


CUT TO:


EXT. TURN-AROUND LATE DAY


TIMECUT: Mackelway leans against the tow truck. Speck's 

Riviera rests upright on level ground.


Wallace smacks an instant ice pack against the side of the 

truck, hands it to Mackelway.


JUMBO

Sorry about that. It's an old truck.


Mackelway presses the ice pack to his swelling forehead:


MACKELWAY

Where's the Nuevo American Diner?


DYLAN

Ten miles back on the Texas side.


WALLACE

I'd go to Pulski's. She makes this 

fabulous fried chicken.


MACKELWAY

Speck had a coffee there last night. 

7:40.

(to Dylan)

This is no robbery.


Mackelway takes the keys from the Riviera's ignition, walks 

around the trunk, unlocks it.


GRANGER

(to Wallace)

What's he doing?


Mack pops the trunk, looks inside. Dylan, Wallace, Granger 

and Jumbo join him. Mack notices white powder amid dark 

stains. He judges the texture of the powder with a ball-point 

pen.


Granger wets his finger, touches the white powder, puts his 

finger to his lips.


MACKELWAY

(grabs Granger's arm)

Hey!


GRANGER

I was going to see if...


MACKELWAY

Don't put nothing in your mouth. 

That's just for TV shows. It could 

be poison for all you know.


GRANGER

(cowed)

It ain't cocaine.


MACKELWAY

I know. It's lime.


DYLAN

Lime?


GRANGER

What are those stains?


MACKELWAY

You say Speck lived in Roswell?


Dylan nods, Mack turns to Wallace:


MACKELWAY

You got a judge on the hook? We'll 

need a search warrant pronto.


WALLACE

(nods)

In the morning.


CUT TO:


EXT. SPECK HOUSE DAY


Title card: "Roswell, New Mexico." A suburban ranch-style 

home: all seems normal, even banal, until the front door 

opens --


And TWO EMS WORKERS wearing facemasks emerge carrying a green 

body bag. They navigate the front steps, step past a Huffy 

bike with training wheels, place the body bag next to four 

others on the front lawn.


Hudspeth County Police and EMS vehicles ring the house. 

Onlookers and press are ringed off by a yellow crime scene 

cordon.


A Honda Civic turns onto the street, glides past neighbors 

on porches, police cars, drives up to the yellow tape.


A fortiesh WOMAN gets out of the front seat lugging a Wal-

Mart bag topped off with light bulbs. She walks toward the 

house as though, with all this commotion, she's not even 

sure it's hers.


Two CHILDREN, eight and four, trail behind her. They can 

tell something is wrong -- a feeling exacerbated when the 

Woman DROPS HER BAG, bulbs popping against the sidewalk, and 

walks ever quicker to the front door.


She RUNS till she sees the body bags, slows, connections 

filling her mind: the extra miles on the car, the strange 

women's clothing, that strange smell downstairs...


WOMAN

Harold! Haarroolldd!


Trooper Wallace, approaching, motions to two cops who swoop 

in, GRAB the kids, now screaming too, as the Woman runs 

inside.


CUT TO:


INT. SPECK HOUSE DAY


The Woman, screaming all the while, runs past police and EMS 

personnel, stopping at the cellar steps, looking down at the 

shadowy figures amid work lights and seeing Harold's computer 

bench, seeing partially uncovered graves, SEEING limed 

desiccated bodies.


Something, some word gurgles in her throat, and then she 

vomits, her stomach buckling. Tom Mackelway, RUSHING OVER, 

grabs her.


CUT TO:


EXT. SPECK HOUSE DAY


Later. The last of the body bags is loaded into the EMS 

vehicle. Mack stands watching with Agent Duncan and Trooper 

Wallace. They turn as an unmarked government car is let 

through the police cordon. Salinas cuts the engine, exits, 

walks over to them:


SALINAS

Agents Duncan, Mackelway.

(they nod)

Anything new?


DUNCAN

Just mopping up. Nine bodies in all.


SALINAS

(looks at news crews)

Anybody talk to the press?


DUNCAN

No, sir.


SALINAS

(to Mack)

The diner?


MACKELWAY

(checks watch)

Headed there now. The same shift 

will be on at noon.


SALINAS

This case has sent bells and alarms 

ringing all the way to Washington. 

Your old boss is coming out.


MACKELWAY

Koessler?


SALINAS

The same.


A muffled BOOM and YELP comes from inside the house.


SALINAS

Wha -- ?


They head over. An INJURED AGENT wearing blue "FBI" jacket 

emerges holding a bloodied hand. The press reacts as a medic 

rushes over to him.


SALINAS

What happened?


INJURED AGENT

The computer in the basement. It 

musta been booby-trapped. I was 

unplugging it, the hard drive 

exploded.


The medic takes the Injured Agent's hand.


CUT TO:


INT. NUEVO AMERICAN DINER AFTERNOON


Mack and Dylan speak with Janita. A black mother and 

hyperactive kids sit in the booth the older couple occupied 

the night before.


JANITA

Harold, he was a regular. Came in 

late nights. Didn't talk much. 

Something happen to him?


DYLAN

Got himself killed, Jan.


JANITA

Sweet Jesus on the Cross.


MACKELWAY

The man who was with him, he was a 

construction worker?


JANITA

Yes.


MACKELWAY

What did he look like?


JANITA

I didn't wait on him. Fifty or so, 

white, regular build, needed a shave -- 

that's all I remember.


MACKELWAY

How did you know he was a construction 

worker?


JANITA

He had an orange hat on.


Dylan chuckles.


MACKELWAY

I hope that wasn't a joke because I 

can assure you, from personal 

experience, the FBI does not have a 

sense of humor.


DYLAN

That's right, Jan.


Mack smiles, gestures to a booth:


MACKELWAY

He was sitting here?


JANITA

It's been wiped down a hundred times 

since then.


Mack walks over to the booth, crouches, runs his ball-point 

along the floor.


JANITA

There was a car in the lot when we 

closed. Gone today.


MACKELWAY

What kind?


JANITA

An old junker. Like a reservation 

car. Blue, side door with brown, you 

know, primer paint. New Mexico plates. 

A Ford or ah, yeah, a Ford.


MACKELWAY

(to Dylan)

Put a BOLO out on that.


Mack reaches out, grabs the orange vinyl booth cushion, yanks 

it out.


Looking under the seat, Mackelway finds a predictable 

assortment of dustballs, coins, paper napkins, dead roaches -- 

and the snapshot.


JANITA

Yeah, I remember. He had some 

pictures.


Mack turns the photo over: it shows, splayed on a concrete 

floor, a nude female TORSO, minus head, hands and feet -- 

breasts excised.


JANITA

My God!


CUT TO:


EXT. DINER AFTERNOON


Mack and Sheriff Dylan walk to their cars.


DYLAN

Nine bodies in Roswell, now this -- 

it's getting a little hairy, huh?


MACKELWAY

I'd appreciate it if you kept this 

to yourself.


DYLAN

I know how the Feds like to sit on 

information. I got something in the 

car to show you.


They step over to Dylan's police car. Dylan removes a folder, 

hands it to Mack. It's a Missing Persons Report: a photo of 

KAREN SUMPTER, 15, pretty young girl wearing a bright red T-

shirt with the South Park slogan, "Oh My God, They Killed 

Kenny!"


DYLAN

Her name is Karen Sumpter, from near 

Dell City. Just disappeared a couple 

weeks back. Vanished.


MACKELWAY

You're thinking...?


DYLAN

Who knows.


MACKELWAY

This isn't in our database?


DYLAN

I just assumed she ran away. Happens 

a lot around here. Look around. This 

place is an invitation to run away.


CUT TO:


INT. EL PASO MORGUE EVENING


Harold Speck and his victims have transformed the autopsy 

examination room into a ghoulish assembly line. M.E. personnel 

work on the mixed-race female victims; some bodies retain 

their features, some don't. The leg of a foreground victim 

has been severed at the ankle; a single stem rose tattoo cut 

in half.


In the distance Salinas and Mackelway stand with GEORGE 

EAGLEFOOT, the Native American Medical Examiner. He motions 

to the naked body of Harold Speck.


EAGLEFOOT

Ligature strangulation, just like 

his victims. A cord, nylon, you can 

tell by the indentation signature -- 

again, like his victims.

(points to Speck's 

penis)

Look at that little thing and look 

at all the trouble it got him in. 

Should have cut it off.


SALINAS

I'm not in the mood for Native 

American wisdom.


EAGLEFOOT

We had to bring staff in from the 

whole county to handle this.


SALINAS

I appreciate it, doctor. You know 

how it is, press screaming for 

answers, Washington's all over me.

(to Mack)

Ever handle a serial case?


MACKELWAY

No.


SALINAS

Hope you never do. At first it feels 

like a sauna, by the time you hit 

victim four it's a fucking burning 

shirt factory.


Eaglefoot looks up at the sound of an opening door. Deputy 

Director DAVID KOESSLER, 50, and JAIME KULOK, 26, enter 

exuding eau de FBI.


KOESSLER

Chuck, hello.

(shake hands)

This is Agent Kulok. She has a 

background in medical forensics.


KULOK

(off Eaglefoot's 

reaction)

Just an observer.


EAGLEFOOT

Be my guest, Agent Kulok, scrub suits 

are in the back.


SALINAS

This is Agent Mackelway.


Mack's attempt to greet Koessler is cut short:


KOESSLER

I know who he is.

(to Kulok)

That's the guy who won't take "fuck 

you" for an answer.

(to Eaglefoot)

This Speck?

(Eaglefoot grunts)

What we got?


Mack sneaks a second look at Kulok: she's the sort that 

triggers a second look.


SALINAS

Speck's the killer all right. We got 

box loads of evidence. Did 'em all 

the same way: torture, strangulation. 

Prostitutes. I don't think we'll be 

able to write off any outstandings 

on him -- this is probably the full 

body count.


KOESSLER

What about his killer?


SALINAS

Nada. Vague description, that's all. 

Fine-tooth-combed Speck's car, the 

diner: no fingerprints, no trace 

evidence.


KOESSLER

What's with the eyelids?


EAGLEFOOT

Ripped off. By hand, my guess. 

Perimortal: victim was alive at the 

time, there's blood on his throat.


SALINAS

That's the thing. Don't know if it 

connects, but Harold here had a thing 

about eyes. Two of the victims had 

their eyes gouged out, another 

punctured. Took polaroids after.


KOESSLER

You have the photo from the diner?


SALINAS

At the field office.


KOESSLER

Let's take a look at it.

(to Kulok)

Drop off my stuff at the hotel after 

you're done here.


Koessler walks off with Salinas, shooting a look back at 

Mackelway as he goes.


CUT TO:


EXT/INT MACK'S CAR DAY


Mackelway drives Agent Kulok through the downtown area. Her 

and Koessler's carry-on bags flopped in back.


KULOK

Thanks for the ride.


MACKELWAY

They sort of got me on shit detail, 

no offense.


KULOK

None taken.


MACKELWAY

Maybe I shouldn't put it that way. 

I'm on my best behavior. I've got to 

watch what I say.


KULOK

You used to be in the Behavioral 

Science Unit, right?


MACKELWAY

(nods)

The Academy, then CIIAC.


KULOK

I read your white paper. It's sort 

of like the Bible for what they're 

trying to do in Computer Crime.


MACKELWAY

How long have you been downtown?


KULOK

Five months. I love it.


Beat.


MACKELWAY

You work with Koessler?


KULOK

Not especially.


MACKELWAY

Why did he come out here? What's 

going on?


KULOK

Beats me. He just asked me to come 

along, double-check the forensics.

(beat)

What did you do to piss him off?


He looks at Jaime, smiles -- better block that thought, he 

thinks. So does she.


KULOK

This is a sexy case.


MACKELWAY

Yeah, you know the vic's car, he was 

killed this side of the state line, 

the car then pushed across the border. 

This by an Unknown Subject, presumably 

the killer, who left no fucking 

evidence except the snapshot, which 

may or may not have been accidental.


KULOK

Doesn't fit.


MACKELWAY

This is no random killing, no one 

shot deal. The UNSUB has killed 

before; he's good at it. So what do 

we have?

(beat)

We have someone who has killed before 

who kills someone who kills: a serial 

killer of a serial killer -- and who 

wants the FBI to know he exists.


KULOK

And who kills in the manner of his 

victim.


MACKELWAY

That information's being withheld 

from the media.


KULOK

(thinks)

A very sexy case.


CUT TO:


INT. MACK'S ROOM NIGHT


Mackelway, wearing jeans and a T-shirt, paces the spare condo. 

Unopened Bekins boxes stacked against a wall. The furnishings 

are uniformly rental, right down to the framed print of Van 

Gogh's Sunflowers. Lou Reed plays on a newly unpacked stereo.


He has something on his mind, a thought keeps running around 

his head. He looks out the window, looks over to the kitchen 

table where his laptop sits open, resumes pacing.


On the computer screen: "Chat Room" folder icons listed by 

time and date. Mack steps over, double clicks an icon: a 

conversation from eight months before appears on the screen. 

The chat room correspondents have screennames like "Troll," 

"MyDick," "Zin," "Murman."


Mack turns off the stereo, goes to the phone and dials. A 

HOTEL OPERATOR answers:


OPERATOR (O.S.)

Marriott El Paso.


MACKELWAY

David Koessler, please.


OPERATOR (O.S.)

Just a moment.


Mack paces, phone in hand.


OPERATOR (O.S.)

There's a Do Not Disturb on that 

line. Would you like voice mail?


MACKELWAY

Yes, please.


Mack waits for the tone, leave message:


MACKELWAY

Deputy Director Koessler, this is 

Thomas Mackelway. I'm sorry to bother 

you like this, I must speak with 

you. I realize you may not be 

comfortable with this, but it's 

extremely important. I've become 

aware of something and I must speak 

to you about it. When you see the 

red light on your phone, please call.


CUT TO:


EXT. SOMEWHERE NIGHT


Ominous music from previous scene plays over dark suburban 

street.


A FIFTEEN YEAR-OLD GIRL, wearing a lacrosse shirt, rides her 

bike around a corner, yellow headphones on her ears. She 

bobs her head to an unheard beat.


Suddenly, without warning, her body is GRABBED in motion by 

a dark figure (SUSPECT ZERO) wearing navy-colored vinyl. He 

CONKS her on the head before she can scream.


CUT TO:


EXT. FEDERAL BUILDING DAY


A federal deputy stands watch -- a consequence of the Oklahoma 

City bombing.


CUT TO:


INT. FBI OFFICES DAY


Mackelway, sports jacket and tie, exits the elevator carrying 

his briefcase. He steps past the bullpen, walk toward Salinas' 

office. Through the glass door he can see Salinas inside 

speaking with Koessler and Kulok.


Their conversation can be faintly heard:


KOESSLER

We didn't know Speck was a serial, 

the police didn't know, his wife 

didn't know -- so how did the killer 

know?


KULOK

Maybe cause he's smart.


KOESSLER

Smarter than us.


Mack hesitates, goes back to his cubicle, places his briefcase 

on the desktop. He sits, activates his computer screen. He 

cannot get the image of Koessler about to go to the airport 

out of his mind.


He stands, determined, strides to Salinas' office. Steeling 

himself, he twists the knob, opens the door --


CUT TO:


INT. SALINAS' OFFICE DAY


Koessler, Salinas and Kulok turn, stare as Mack enters. This 

is a big no-no, a breach of protocol, not to mention 

etiquette:


MACKELWAY

(eyes going to Koessler)

Look, sorry. Don't say a word.

(gathers breath)

I know this is improper. I've been 

trying to speak with Deputy Director 

Koessler. I left a message. I must 

speak with you before you go back to 

Washington.


KOESSLER

This better be important.


SALINAS

(to Mack)

Agent, return to your station.


Kulok looks at Mack, wishing somehow this wasn't happening.


MACKELWAY

I think I talked to him.


KOESSLER

Who?


MACKELWAY

Speck. Harold Speck.


KOESSLER

From the grave?


MACKELWAY

MyDick.


SALINAS

"MyDick?"


MACKELWAY

MyDick. As in my dick. That was his 

screen name.


SALINAS

I don't...


MACKELWAY

Eight, nine months ago. When I was 

at Computer Crime. I got into a chat 

room with someone named MyDick. I'd 

talked to him before. Everything I 

saw yesterday, everything in the 

autopsies, it's identical. The 

forensics are dead on. MyDick's 

fantasies involved a hog-tie rig, 

nylon cord, torture with pliers, rip 

the nipples -- when the "item" 

screams, she chokes. He had a thing 

about eyes, always the eyes -- stab 

their eyes. It's the same guy. Speck 

was MyDick.


SALINAS

Speck is dead.


MACKELWAY

I talked to him.


KOESSLER

I'll relay this to CIIAC.


MACKELWAY

They don't know how to crack these 

secret chat rooms --


KOESSLER

I might point out, Agent Mackelway, 

the reason we haven't been able to 

crack those rooms is that you refused 

to share that information with us -- 

which is also why you were reassigned.


MACKELWAY

I had gotten their trust. We were 

sharing fantasies. I couldn't risk 

it.


KOESSLER

The Federal Bureau of Investigation 

is not based on personal preference. 

We share information.


MACKELWAY

Let some by-the-book J. Edgar Agents 

go into the chat room, spook these 

guys with stupid questions, blow my 

cover? -- no way.


KOESSLER

You refused to comply with a direct 

order.


MACKELWAY

I was lucky to find, much less crack, 

the address code -- no way to be 

sure I could have done it again.


KOESSLER

Its called insubordination.


MACKELWAY

Then why do I still have a badge?


Koessler doesn't answer that question; Mack was too valuable 

to be dismissed -- Koessler decided instead to teach him a 

lesson, hoped he would come around.


KOESSLER

I appreciate the information, Agent 

Mackelway -- but if you think this 

is going to get you back to Computer 

Crime, dream on.

(to Salinas)

Now, where were we?


Mack steps back. He has been dismissed.


CUT TO:


INT. MACK'S CUBICLE DAY


LATER. Mackelway, jacket off, absent-mindedly stares at his 

computer screen. He looks up, sees Koessler and Kulok leaving 

with carry-on bags. Jaime shrugs, shoots Mack a sympathetic 

look as if to say: I wish I could have been of some help.


Mack's phone extension rings; he answers:


MACKELWAY

Agent Mackelway.


DYLAN (O.S.)

Mack, this is Sheriff Dylan.


MACKELWAY

Oh Jesus, Sheriff, I am sorry. I 

meant to call you -- I got distracted -- 

the Sumpter girl was not one of 

Speck's victims. That's the good 

news.


DYLAN (O.S.)

What's the bad news?


MACKELWAY

You tell me.


DYLAN (O.S.)

No bad news. You know the Be On the 

LookOut you asked me to send on the 

diner car -- we got a hit on it. A 

little town on the border, Socorro. 

We got it staked out -- you 

interested?


MACKELWAY

I'm on my way.


CUT TO:


EXT. SOCORRO DAIRY QUEEN LATE DAY


Mackelway's sedan pulls up beside Dylan's Sheriff vehicle. 

The Dairy Queen being the town's most thriving enterprise. 

In the distance, makeshift housing and dump zones.


Mack gets out, walks over to Dylan.


MACKELWAY

(sits)

Hey, Sheriff.


DYLAN

Down the road a piece is the Golden 

Sunset, the no-tell motel, Socorro's 

contribution to international 

relations. The car's just sitting 

there, no activity. I've had a couple 

Hispanic officers casing it all day. 

Want to take a look?


MACKELWAY

What does the Manager say?


DYLAN

I sent a female in. The room in 

question was rented by an Anglo, 

cash; since then, nothing -- no 

activity, no phone response.


MACKELWAY

Let's take a look.


CUT TO:


EXT. GOLDEN SUNSET LATE DAY


The suspect vehicle sits outside Room 8: 1985 blue Ford, 

brown primer door, New Mexico plates. One other vehicle, a 

pickup, parked several spaces away.


Dylan parks a discreet distance from the motel. Mack turns 

to the Sheriff:


MACKELWAY

(removing tie)

I'm going to take a little walk.


Mack tosses his jacket on the seat as he heads toward the 

Golden Sunset. He stops at the soda machine, looks around, 

continues. His trained eyes spot Dylan's undercover Hispanics -- 

one "sleeping" across the way, another "repairing" a flat 

tire.


Mackelway, feigning nonchalance, walks past the parked Ford. 

He looks inside: the motel room key lies on the front seat.


LONG LENS POV: someone is watching Mack as he looks inside 

the parked Ford.


CUT TO:


EXT. DAIRY QUEEN EVENING


Mack rejoins Dylan:


MACKELWAY

The room key's in the car. On the 

seat.


DYLAN

And it's getting dark. I'm not going 

to run this into the night.

(clicks walkie)

Eddie, we're walking in. Everything 

covered?


EDDIE (O.S.)

No problemo.


CUT TO:


EXT. GOLDEN SUNSET DUSK


Dylan and Mack, wearing latex gloves, approach the door. 

Dylan's Hispanic undercover cops watch their backs. Dylan, 

holding his pistol to his side, opens door #8 with a master 

key. Music leads the way: he and Mack enter.


CUT TO:


INT. MOTEL ROOM DUSK


They step inside; the room is pristine. Nothing has been 

used, nothing touched -- the aroma of disinfectant hangs in 

the air.


Dylan edges to the bathroom, looks inside. He keys his walkie:


DYLAN

Show's over, boys. Nobody home.


MACKELWAY

Tape it off, we'll want to fine-tooth-

comb it. My guess is that the UNSUB 

is having us on. He checks in, pays, 

picks up the key, but never walks 

inside. Tell me if I'm wrong.


DYLAN

(looks around)

Got a sister like this, what they 

call it, anal? That's her.


LONG LENS POV THROUGH WINDOW: Mack answers Dylan.


CUT TO:


EXT. GOLDEN SUNSET NIGHT


Mack, scrounging his car keys from his pocket, walks to his 

sedan. Music underscores the mood. Mack hears a CLANK from 

the motel, turns abruptly to look: one of Dylan's deputies 

has knocked over a metal barrier. Mack continues toward the 

car.


He opens the door, plops inside. Placing the keys in the 

ignition, he hears something behind him...


Turning to look, frightened: the last thing he sees, the 

last thing he remembers, is a BLURRED FACE and the feel and 

smell of a chloroform RAG pressed against his nose and mouth.


CUT TO:


INT. LIMBO NIGHT


Mackelway comes to in darkness, hog-tied and blindfolded. A 

white nylon cord, tied around his neck, stretches across his 

back, through his bound hands around his bent legs. It is a 

painful position.


Smelling something rancid, Mack sniffs: where is he? A garbage 

dump?


Richard Low, wearing a burgundy turtleneck, scrunches atop 

Mack, speaks softly:


LOW

Scared, Agent Mackelway?

(Mack says nothing)

It's a terrible feeling, isn't it? 

Alone. Trapped. Knowing you're going 

to die. The terror of dying is much 

worse than death itself.


Mackelway attempts to stretch his cramping muscles; the noose 

tightens around his neck, choking him. Mack resumes the 

original position.


LOW

This is how Speck tied his victims. 

Imagine what that was like, for those 

girls in his car. Imagine the ride 

tied in his trunk. He's already raped 

you. Maybe he's cut you. Maybe he's 

cut you inside.


Mack struggles to turn his head in the direction of Low's 

voice.


LOW

As you sit there listening to the 

road, feeling all the places you're 

bleeding, you wonder -- is it over? 

Will he just kill me? Please?


Low reaches down, TWISTS Mack's nipple: Mackelway buckles in 

pain, choking.


LOW

But he doesn't. He's only begun, he 

rapes you again, twists your skin 

with pliers, all the time looking at 

your eyes, into your eyes like he's 

never seen anything like them before, 

holding a knife -- then, if you're 

not dead already, only then does he 

take those eyes out.


Low leans into Mack's ear, whispers darkly:


LOW

Tell me, Agent Mackelway, does that 

man deserve to live? Does he have 

the right to exist one more day, one 

more hour? You have the temerity to 

hunt me for killing such a man?


Mack, holding back his fear, asks in a steady voice:


MACKELWAY

How did you know Speck was a killer?


LOW

The little piggie speaks.


Low twists Mack's nipple again -- harder this time. Gagging, 

Mack asks:


MACKELWAY

Who are you?


LOW

I'll give you a little hint. You're 

a smart guy, figure it out.


Low unfolds a razor-sharp jack knife, cuts open the upper 

arm of Mackelway's shirt, SLASHES three strokes across Mack's 

bicep.


Reacting to the pain, Mack twists his torso, begins to 

seriously choke; Low pulls at the nylon cord, exacerbating 

Mack's condition.


As Mackelway passes out, Low cuts the nylon cord with his 

knife. Screen goes black.


CUT TO:


INT. HOSPITAL ROOM DAY


Thomas Mackelway opens his eyes, sees the DOCTOR tapping his 

shoulder:


DOCTOR

You've got company.


Mack, rubbing the rope marks on his neck, looks around: 

Koessler, Salinas and Kulok stand around the bed.


KOESSLER

How do you feel, Agent


MACKELWAY

Pretty embarrassed, to be honest. I 

had him.


KOESSLER

Agent Kulok and I were in O'Hare 

when we heard.


MACKELWAY

He got away. I had him. He got away.


KOESSLER

Do you think he singled you out?


MACKELWAY

No, just coincidence. He knew who I 

was, of course. He had my ID -- did 

he keep it?


KULOK

(points)

It's here.


Mack opens his wallet, reacts to the aroma.


KULOK

Some kids found you in a garbage 

dump.


MACKELWAY

Where's my watch? It's gone.


KOESSLER

The cut on your arm -- mind if we 

remove the bandage?


MACKELWAY

Go ahead.


Koessler motions to the Doctor, who cuts the white gauze off 

Mack's bicep, revealing three fresh congealed slashes forming 

a "Z."


KOESSLER

Thank you, doctor.


The Doctor, taking the hint, excuses himself.


KOESSLER

He said it was a clue?


SALINAS

(looking closer)

Maybe something to do with Zorro.


KOESSLER

Don't say that. Don't even think 

that. The next thing we'll be hearing 

about "Zorro Killer" in the media -- 

this hasn't gotten out, has it?


SALINAS

Just hospital talk. Nothing that 

connects to Speck.


KOESSLER

This could all be a coincidence, 

but, you know something, I don't 

believe in coincidences. That's why 

I came back.

(to Mack)

Do you think the UNSUB -- we're not 

going to mention the word Zorro -- 

met Harold Speck online?


MACKELWAY

Yes I do.


KULOK

It explains a lot.


SALINAS

But why attack an Agent?


MACKELWAY

He wants us to know he's out there, 

what he's doing. It's not enough 

just to kill somebody like Speck, he 

wants us to know he did it.


KOESSLER

(thinks)

Agent Mackelway, you're going to get 

your wish. You're going back to 

Washington. I want you back in 

Computer Crimes. Fire up those chat 

rooms.


MACKELWAY

This time, sir, if I may be so bold, 

would it be possible to set up my 

equipment outside CIIAC, perhaps in 

military housing at Quantico? I didn't 

get along very well with the other 

members of the Division. We thought 

differently.


KOESSLER

You didn't like anyone looking over 

your shoulder -- why was that? What 

were you doing?


MACKELWAY

(ignoring question)

If my Reporting Agent could be someone 

outside Computer Crimes, perhaps 

Agent Kulok?


Koessler looks at Jaime, his mind running scenarios:


KOESSLER

I'll take it into consideration.


MACKELWAY

What I do requires confidentiality.


KOESSLER

I always meant to ask, what is it 

that makes you so special? Why is it 

you have this special rapport with 

multiple killers? Why you?


MACKELWAY

They like my stories. They like the 

way I think. They're into fantasy. I 

turn them on.


All in all, quite an astounding statement -- it just hangs 

there. No one responds.


CUT TO:


EXT. QUANTICO EVENING


Aerial view of a sprawl of office buildings and military 

facilities in a green wooded landscape. Subtitle reads: "FBI 

Academy, Quantico, Virginia."


CUT TO:


EXT. MACK'S APARTMENT EVENING


A van sits outside a red brick barracks-style Officers Housing 

unit.


CUT TO:


MACK'S APARTMENT EVENING


Mackelway, dressed casually, instructs young FBI techies 

installing a shitload of Dell computer equipment: computer 

towers, mainframe, digital analyzers, scanners, printers, 

voice actualizer, etc.


Mack has duct-taped the windows with aluminum foil, blocking 

exterior light. The room is assuming a life of it's own. An 

interior life. He flips lights on and off as the techies 

work, testing light schemes.


MACKELWAY

Download whatever punters you find.


TECHIE #1

Don't worry, sir, we learned from 

the best.


MACKELWAY

Who's that?


TECHIE #1

We learned from the people you taught.


MACKELWAY

They remember me?


TECHIE #2

Yes, sir, they do.


Jaime Kulok, passing the sterile living room, tiptoes into 

the computer space. Mack turns:


MACKELWAY

Jaime. Boys, this is Agent Kulok.


The Techies deferentially greet her.


KULOK

Relax.

(to Mack)

J. Edgar's greatest fear: a female 

with a badge.


MACKELWAY

The man knew how to dress.


KULOK

Don't even go there. What's up?


MACKELWAY

Setting up. Technically, anyone in a 

chat room can be traced back to a 

screen address. But, by using punters, 

a correspondent literally punts his 

address around the world, through 

computers in countries that have no 

communication treaties. The 

correspondent becomes "ghosted," 

invisible.


KULOK

What about the chat rooms themselves?


MACKELWAY

That's the beauty of the system. 

This is a fugitive chat room. It 

moves from place to place, chat rooms 

that are normally empty at certain 

hours: a gardening website, Chaucer 

buffs, a dating service. A pre-

arranged code shows up in one of 

fifty porn rooms -- that's where I 

stumbled across it -- notifying 

"friends" to meet at a certain time, 

usually midnight to three Eastern 

Standard, at a certain website -- a 

deserted chat room, say, "How to 

Plant Perennials." Come Tuesday, 

twelve a.m., bingo, these like-minded 

deviates log on and start yakking it 

up: explicit sex crime gossip, who 

did what to whom, who wants to do 

what, when, why and how.


KULOK

That's part of the reason I dropped 

by. I need to learn this stuff.


MACKELWAY

The other reason?


KULOK

(looks at watch)

You want to have dinner?


CUT TO:


EXT. RED LOBSTER NIGHT


A chain restaurant with prices pegged to a government 

employee's budget.


CUT TO:


INT. RED LOBSTER NIGHT


Mackelway and Kulok sit in a booth eating salads, sipping 

white wine.


MACKELWAY

Working the net isn't that different 

from ordinary undercover work. You 

go into the community, walk their 

walk, talk their talk, gain their 

confidence.


KULOK

They're all criminals?


MACKELWAY

No, no, no, most of them -- I used 

to think all of them -- are just 

fantasists, guys who get off telling 

degrading stories. When I came across 

this fugitive chat room, listened 

in, I started to think some might 

actually be real, that they'd gone 

live. The challenge was to figure 

out which was which. Then I had my 

disagreement with Koessler.


KULOK

"Gone live?"


MACKELWAY

Chat jargon for moving from fantasy 

to real victims: "I went live last 

month."


KULOK

This is some serious shit.


MACKELWAY

Taking a Stryker saw, cutting off 

the top of someone's cranium, pulling 

the brain out -- what's that, a day 

in Spring?


KULOK

(laughs)

You got a point there.


MACKELWAY

People end up in occupations for a 

reason. They may think not, but they 

do: occupations define us.


KULOK

I was going to be a physician, I am 

a physician, but I kept drifting 

over to criminal psych. This seems 

to be the best of both. My parents 

still haven't forgiven me.


MACKELWAY

I was interested in two things: 

computers and crime. They sort of 

came together.


KULOK

And one other thing.


MACKELWAY

What's that?


KULOK

Sex.


He smiles; so does she. He likes this girl. A WAITRESS removes 

their salad plates.


MACKELWAY

Once you get in the mind set, though, 

it can take you over.


Mack motions to a young UPS DELIVERY MAN drinking coffee, 

then to an OVERWEIGHT middle-aged man wearing a Tazmanian 

Devil T-shirt, Chicago Bulls jacket and Disney World baseball 

cap.


MACKELWAY

Look at this fellow... or this one.


KULOK

Grown man dressed like a clown. Does 

he really think he looks good?


MACKELWAY

He thinks he looks young.


KULOK

What's this country coming to?


MACKELWAY

Take it to the next level. What are 

his fantasies, what turns him on, 

what kind of pornography does he 

like? If he could act out his 

fantasies, what would he do? Imagine 

yourself one of his victims, realizing 

your life is in his hands. What is 

he thinking?


KULOK

My guess: he's wondering whether to 

get more fries or go straight to the 

chocolate sundae.


Mack laughs as the Waitress returns with two fish plates:


WAITRESS

(about wine glasses)

Another round?


MACKELWAY AND KULOK

Yes, please.


They smile at the synchronicity of their response. His smile 

turns inward:


MACKELWAY

Every cop has a story and every story 

has a girl. The girl in my story was 

fifteen years-old. She wore a pink 

angora sweater -- I can still see it -- 

one day, she disappeared. I told the 

police she wouldn't run away, I told 

them who to look for, but I was just 

a kid. I sat in the police station 

crying and crying. My parents took 

me home. The girl was my cousin and 

the man who abducted her was a teacher 

I'd had. He kept her alive a week 

before he killed her. The police 

could have saved her. Every time I 

see a photo of a victim I see her. 

That's what I want to do. I want to 

save her.


KULOK

Me too.

(sips from empty glass)

Make any headway with "Zorro"?


MACKELWAY

None. Can't find a thing. Nothing on 

file, nothing online. It's not a 

part of any known killer's signature.


KULOK

I was thinking, maybe we should ask 

Professor Daitz. Nobody knows this 

stuff better.


MACKELWAY

That's because he's a fucking wacko. 

Never met a self-promotion scheme he 

didn't like. What's he doing now?


KULOK

He's a consultant to a network TV 

program on Profilers. He gets a check 

every episode.


Mack shakes his head, looks at the Overweight Man: the 

Waitress brings him a double scoop chocolate sundae.


CUT TO:


INT. MACK'S APARTMENT NIGHT


Late night: camera drifts through Mackelway's pre-furnished 

Quantico apartment, approaches his computer room. Sound of a 

modem dialing, connection grows LOUDER.


Mack has designed the room as an emotional as well as 

functional environment: ambient blue light, white noise air 

conditioner, scanner, printer, horizontal racks of hard drive 

memory, modems, U-shaped table featuring three monitors, all 

active. Wall clocks feature time zones around the world. 

Pinned to the back wall are crime scene reports, VICAP forms, 

and photos, among them, Harold Speck, his "Z" slash, Karen 

Sumpter, the Dell City runaway in the South Park T-shirt.


Mackelway, enveloped in a womb of computer screen glow, types 

a website address on the center keyboard. The monitor brings 

up a "Fresh Water Fishing" chat room.


Atop the monitor sits a speech synthesizer. It allows Mack 

to listen as well as read chat conversations: a metallic 

voice "actualizes" the printed copy.


Mack looks at the East Coast time zone clock: the second 

hand signals twelve a. m. The chat room comes ALIVE. One by 

one correspondents log on: Troll, Ripper, BelaKiss, Murman, 

Imelda, Lickme, Zin, Mack enters his name: "Lionheart."


Mack speaks into a voice box atop the computer. It transforms 

his words into text.


Screenwriter's note: the metallic voices do not indicate the 

name of the speaker. That can be indicated, if necessary, by 

the computer screen. Metallic voices are indicated by [].


TROLL (O.S.)

[Hello, had to rush over. Was tying 

up some loose ends.]


RIPPER (O.S.)

[You wish.]


TROLL (O.S.)

[Any word on Battick? He's a cool 

dude.]


MURMAN (O.S.)

[Fantasy time, girls, give it up, 

give it up.]


MACKELWAY

Lionheart here. I'm back. Sorry about 

the absence. I had to do some therapy 

at the crossbar hotel.


RIPPER (O.S.)

[What happened?]


MACKELWAY

Fucking cops can't take a joke.


ZIN (O.S.)

[Welcome back.]


TROLL (O.S.)

[How many times does thirty go into 

nine?]


MURMAN (O.S.)

[What facility, Lionheart?]


TROLL (O.S.)

[Three, if she's tied up.]


MACKELWAY

I'd have to make the conversation 

personal to divulge that.


IMEDLA (O.S.)

[Tee Hee.]


MURMAN (O.S.)

[I could have sent you some goodies.]


LICKME (O.S.)

[Battick declared sane as rain. He 

goes to trial.]


RIPPER (O.S.)

[Boring, boring, boring.]


MURMAN (O.S.)

[Play time. Somebody turn me on.]


TROLL (O.S.)

[Okay: I come home from work, been 

thinking about it all day long. Cute 

little colored girl. She's still 

there, in the basement, tied up. 

She's shit all over herself...]


CUT TO:


INT. ZERO KILL SPACE NIGHT


Camera pans across a dark small space. The white fifteen 

year-old abducted earlier lies unmoving, white-faced on some 

sort of grid. Dried blood covers the front of her lacrosse 

shirt.


Troll's metallic voice fantasy continues as camera pans to a 

jackhammer whose drill has been welded to a shovel spade, 

hung on a rough-hewn wall. Next to it hangs a conventional 

shovel.


TROLL (O.S.)

[...Her eyes go wide when she sees 

me. I've got an erection like a piece 

of rebar -- I could stick it in her 

mouth and crack open the back of her 

head. I tell her I went to the 

hardware store, picked up a little 

present for her.]


CUT TO:


EXT. UNIVERSITY OF VIRGINIA DAY


Red-bricked campus at Charlottesville.


CUT TO:


INT. DAITZ OFFICE DAY


A wall of framed (some signed) photos of Lloyd Daitz posing 

with famous serial killers, national politicians, film 

celebrities and talk show hosts. A nearby bookshelf features 

multicopies of books authored by Daitz, books with titles 

like "Index of Serial Killers," "In the Mind of the Multiple 

Killer," "A Pictorial History of Serial Killers."


LLOYD DAITZ, 55, wears a tweed sports jacket, his university 

look offset by accessories picked up in Hollywood: razor-cut 

hair, tassled loafers, designer eyeglasses. A Mercedes 

brochure lies on his desk. Mackelway and Kulok peruse his 

photo wall with appropriate awe.


DAITZ

Of course I remember you. Pretty 

girl fixated on extreme criminal 

behavior. Always wondered, what were 

the underlying factors?


KULOK

(to Mack)

That was the name of Professor Daitz's 

course, "Underlying Factors in 

Criminal Behavior." You still teach, 

Professor?


DAITZ

(jokes)

You know the saying, those who can't 

do, teach. Besides: it keeps me 

honest.


MACKELWAY

Have you had a chance to think about --


DAITZ

Zorro. Yes, ran it through my files, 

even asked around: came up completely 

blank. Thought there might be a Mexico 

connection, El Paso and all, but 

nothing. Fooled around with the letter 

"Z," turned it on it's side, got "N" --  

there Ng, he's Vietnamese. The only 

thing that came to mind was zero, 

not Zorro. Remember Suspect Zero?


MACKELWAY

No.


DAITZ

Before your time. It was Richard 

Low's brainchild, or, lack-of-brain 

child. The Behavioral Sciences Unit 

at Quantico is essentially the product 

of three men: David Koessler, Dick 

Low and myself. Low was a field agent, 

Koessler administrative, I was 

teaching criminology. Low came up 

with the concept of a serial killer's 

signature. He invented profiling. 

Everything we know about profiling 

started with Richard Low...


As he speaks, camera goes to photo of a younger Lloyd Daitz, 

Richard Low and David Koessler, arm-in-arm at Bureau 

Headquarters. (We realize the UNSUB and Low are one and the 

same: screenwriters note: this is an optional reveal.)


DAITZ

...well, there was some friction: I 

wanted to write up my work, educate 

the public, but Koessler wouldn't 

allow it. Low felt Koessler was more 

interested in career advancement 

than catching killers. Koessler had 

Low reassigned to the Pacific 

Northwest, Seattle. You know when 

they say, stick it where the sun 

don't shine? That's where they stuck 

Dick Low.


MACKELWAY

Pacific Northwest is a hotbed for 

serials.


DAITZ

You got that right. Low became 

obsessed with the Green River murders, 

the case had been inactive for ten 

years at that point. He argued the 

Green River Killer had actually become 

Suspect Zero, this master murderer 

who killed without pattern, killed 

literally hundreds of victims -- 

male, female, old, young, straight, 

gay -- and who was still killing, 

even though there were no bodies. It 

went against everything we knew. Low 

became increasingly paranoid. Every 

suspect was potentially Suspect Zero. 

Anybody tried to talk sense into 

him, he'd accuse them of being out 

to get him. Deputy Director Koessler 

was "out to get him." The decision 

was made to relieve him.


KULOK

But they didn't.


DAITZ

Fortunately, from a Bureau point of 

view, Richard Low was killed in a 

small plane crash about that time. A 

convenient conclusion. The end of 

Low, the end of Zero.


MACKELWAY

Does Koessler know about the Suspect 

Zero theory?


DAITZ

Of course. He knows everything about 

Dick Low.


CUT TO:


EXT. UNIVERSITY OF VIRGINIA DAY


Mack and Kulok stroll the bucolic campus toward their 

government issue car. Two coeds pass, gossiping and laughing.


MACKELWAY

(about Daitz)

I ever get like that, just take me 

out in back and shoot me.


KULOK

Don't be too harsh.


MACKELWAY

I saw him on a talk show once, talking 

about these killers like they were 

his friends. Not the victims, not 

the families of the victims, he 

doesn't talk about them. Blood money, 

that's what it is.

(they walk a few steps)

Did he hit on you?


KULOK

Huh?


MACKELWAY

When you were his student? Did he 

come on to you?


KULOK

Of course he did. He came on to every 

attractive student. Which bothers 

you most: that he exploits suffering 

or that he came on to me?


MACKELWAY

You must really think I'm a square, 

a computer nerd.


KULOK

No, Mack, I do not think you're a 

square and definitely not a nerd.


She runs her hand along his back as she crosses to get in 

the passenger seat. Her touch is electric.


CUT TO:


INT. MACK'S CAR DAY


Mack puts the key in the ignition, turns to Jaime:


MACKELWAY

Why did Koessler assign you as my 

liaison?


KULOK

Because you asked him to, stupid.


MACKELWAY

(chuckles)

Oh yeah, I forgot.


Mackelway doesn't start the car. He just looks at Jaime. He 

feels a desire to kiss her -- here and now. She feels a desire 

to be kissed.


KULOK

There are Agency regulations about 

this.


MACKELWAY

"Intra-Agency fraternizing."


KULOK

It's a no-no.


MACKELWAY

(touches her cheek)

I know.


KULOK

I've been thinking about this.


MACKELWAY

Does Koessler ask about me?


KULOK

He's called a couple times.


MACKELWAY

What did you tell him?


KULOK

Just routine stuff.


MACKELWAY

Not about coming to see Daitz?


KULOK

Not yet. Not about this, either.


She leans over and kisses him. He reaches over, kissing her, 

holding her. Over their embrace the metallic voices of Mack's 

chat pals pre-lap:


TROLL (O.S.)

[Roses are red, Violets are blue, 

I'd love to jam a golf club, Inside 

you.]


ZIN (O.S.)

[No time for poetry, no time for 

images. Images deceive. Only reality 

satisfies.]


MURMAN (O.S.)

[Reality very risky.]


MACKELWAY (O.S.)

Whatever happened to MyDick?


ZIN (O.S.)

[I want to be live. A live. Have a 

package of my very own.]


CUT TO:


EXT. MAILBOXES USA DAY


Title: "Tampa, Florida." ROBERT TESTA, 26, scraggly beard 

obscuring acne scars, jeans, lumberjack shirt with cut-off 

sleeves, walks furtively into the P.O. Box outlet, looking 

side to side.


We view him LONG LENS, from the POV of a hidden viewer.


Testa goes to a P.O. Box, unlocks it, retrieves a small 

package. He looks around, tucks it into his waistband, walks 

outside to his dinged-up blue van.


MURMAN (O.S.)

[MyDick's limp.]


LICKME (O.S.)

[I have WAV goodies.]


TROLL (O.S.)

[What are the three best things about 

anal sex?]


MACKELWAY

What limped him?


TROLL (O.S.)

[Location, location, location.]


LICKME (O.S.)

[The crux of it all.]


ZIN (O.S.)

[Want to take it more personal?]


MURMAN (O.S.)

[Here's the lowdown: he was a fool. 

MyDick didn't know dick.]


LICKME (O.S.)

[Free to all: a little recording I 

made for my friends.]


CUT TO:


INT. MACK'S COMPUTER ROOM NIGHT


Mack, bathed in computer light, watches LickMe's audio 

download complete. He clicks "Play."


MURMAN (O.S.)

[Didn't see it coming.]


A miniature digital polaroid of a naked girl tied to a bench 

appears onscreen.


The recording downloads, then plays: a girl PLEADS for her 

life, says her parents are expecting her, says the police 

will come, says she'll do anything, begs that he not hurt 

her again and screams, screams, screams.


Mackelway, shaking, sinks his head into his hands: this is 

it, the black soul of humankind, the Pit, evil itself. The 

audio recording may be real; it may be fake -- either way, 

Mack is face to face with the reality of role playing.


Sickened, Mack logs off, rushes out of the room.


CUT TO:


INT. BATHROOM NIGHT


Tom Mackelway, ripping his clothes off as he enters, turns 

on the shower faucets. Still wearing slacks and shoes, Mack 

steps into the shower, THRUSTS his face into the water stream. 

Grabs bath gel, rubs it all over him.


MACKELWAY

(to himself)

Damn you, goddamn you.

Pennsylvania Ave. at 10th.


CUT TO:


INT. KOESSLER'S OFFICE DAY


Deputy Director has assembled representatives of various 

divisions to go over the Harold Speck case: Mackelway, Asst. 

Deputy Director for CIIAC (aka Computer Crimes) LEMAR RYAN, 

Special Agent SPIVAK, Agent DUNLEVY. Koessler's office 

features the appurtenances of power, in an understated in-

your-face sort of way.


KOESSLER

You feeling okay, Agent Mackelway?


MACKELWAY

(nods)

Had trouble sleeping last night, 

sir.


KOESSLER

Okay, Harold Speck: who goes first?


SPIVAK

The UNSUB's car, the Ford, and the 

motel room, as expected, came up 

empty. Whistle clean. The waitress 

was right, it was a reservation car -- 

a stolen reservation car.


Koessler turns to Dunlevy.


DUNLEVY

VICAP kicked out the Ron "Slice and 

Dice" Rice killing, another serial 

killer killed in the manner of his 

victims. Nothing else on Rice cross-

checks, weapon, timing, signature -- 

there is no signature. He uses the 

M.O. of his victims.


KOESSLER

Think it's the same UNSUB?


DUNLEVY

Maybe. It's a stretch.


KOESSLER

Assistant Deputy Ryan?


RYAN

CIIAC has nothing. I can't speak for 

Agent Mackelway, however, since he's 

off campus.


KOESSLER

(reacts to Ryan's 

implied criticism)

We've been over this.

(to Mack)

Agent Mackelway?


MACKELWAY

Nothing concrete. Nothing I'd... 

well, nothing.


KOESSLER

I don't believe this.


MACKELWAY

I'm hesitant to...


KOESSLER

Mack the Mouth at a loss for words.


They wait.


MACKELWAY

Okay, here it is. I've been talking 

in a ghosted chat room with someone 

named Murman. This Murman seemed to 

know MyDick -- Harold Speck -- was 

out of the picture, he said MyDick 

could no longer "see." Okay, but 

here's where it gets squirrely.


Mackelway pulls out a piece of paper, reads:


MACKELWAY

"MyDick didn't know dick." "The 

lowdown." "Lowballed." "Too rich for 

me." "Lower than zero."


RYAN

I don't get it.


MACKELWAY

I think this guy, Murman, he seems 

to have a thing about former Assistant 

Deputy Director Richard Low. It would 

explain the cutting; not Zorro, Zero. 

Perhaps they once had contact. We 

should go through Low's old cases. 

It's almost like he is Richard Low.

(to Koessler: snide)

I mean, Assistant Deputy Director 

Low is dead, isn't he?


Ryan and Dunlevy react to Mack's tone of voice. Koessler, 

the disciplinarian, turns to the others:


KOESSLER

Would you excuse us? I'd like to 

speak to Agent Mackelway.


The others file out giving Mack looks: he's gonna catch Hell 

now.


Koessler closes the door, takes a deep breath, turns to Mack:


KOESSLER

He may not be.


CUT TO:


EXT. FT. MYERS DAY


Robert Testa's van slows to a halt in a warehouse district. 

CANDY, nom de street, blond high school dropout in red vinyl 

skirt, steps to the passenger window as he lowers it.


TESTA

Wanna ride?


CANDY

Where you going?


TESTA

Fifty dollars.


CANDY

Always wanted to go there.


Candy opens the door, gets in. The van drives away.


CUT TO:


INT. TESTA'S VAN DAY


Candy looking out the window as the van turns into an alley:


CANDY

Is this your --


POW! Testa reaches over, HITS the back of her head with a 

short club. Candy bounces off the window.


Testa, jamming the van into park, reaching over, turning 

Candy around, handcuffs her, opens a camouflaged door to the 

rear of the van, DRAGS Candy by her wrists -- blond wig 

falling from her head.


Candy, coming to, looking around, seeing Testa's mobile 

chamber of horrors, SCREAMING:


CANDY

Please, please don't hurt me.


TESTA

That's exactly what I got in mind. 

I'm gonna hurt you, little girl, 

places you've never been hurt before.


Candy sees a crowbar and a chain saw in a wooden box. Testa 

has soundproofed the van with furniture pads and styrofoam.


TESTA

Scream all you want. Get used to it.


An arm reaches over, grabs Testa's shoulder: Richard Low, 

dressed like a homeless person.


LOW

Robert Testa?


TESTA

Wha -- ?


Low PUNCHES his face with steel knuckles; Testa's head jerks 

back. Blood drips from his nose. Eyes on Testa, Low barks at 

Candy:


LOW

Get out. Get out, now!


Candy, still handcuffed, awkwardly SCRAMBLES into the front 

seat, out the passenger door. Low leaning over Testa, PINNING 

him to the floor of the van, pulling out his own pair of 

handcuffs, turning Testa over, shutting the soundproof door:


LOW

Scream all you want.


Robert Testa, face down now, handcuffed, scared shitless, 

twists his head to see his attacker. Low, breathing heavy, 

feeling good, reaches for the chainsaw. Knees on Testa's 

back, Low prepares to start the chainsaw:


LOW

Welcome to my fantasy.


Richard Low jerk-starts the chain SAW and, holding it at 

arm's length, leans over, whispers into Testa's ear:


LOW

Murman.


CUT TO:


INT. KOESSLER'S OFFICE DAY


Conversation between Mack and Koessler continues:


KOESSLER

"Murman" was the alter identity of 

William Heirens, the original "Catch 

Me Before I Kill Again" killer. Short 

for "Murder Man." It was the case 

that got Richard Low and I started 

in this field.


MACKELWAY

I spoke with Lloyd Daitz.


KOESSLER

That gasbag. I can imagine what he 

said. I'm not ashamed to admit that 

most of what I know about criminal 

profiling started with Richard Low. 

I have also, over the years, I admit, 

taken credit for many of his 

accomplishments. He was the most 

brilliant law enforcement individual 

I ever met.


MACKELWAY

"Was?"


KOESSLER

We had every reason to believe he 

was on that plane. He was supposed 

to be on the plane. Everything was 

incinerated, it was two weeks before 

we reached the crash site. We, the 

Director and I, decided it was in 

everyone's best interest to declare 

Dick Low dead. That way he could 

exit a hero.


MACKELWAY

You suspected all along, suspected 

he was alive. That's why you came to 

El Paso.


KOESSLER

(nods)

Dunlevy said there was another case, 

Ron Rice. In fact, there were two 

earlier cases where serials were 

murdered. The second was George 

Sheldon. I didn't enter it into VICAP -- 

I'll get you the file.


MACKELWAY

How long ago?


KOESSLER

Both in the last year. I suspected 

only someone as brilliant as Dick 

Low could find these guys.

(beat)

Look, whatever Daitz told you, nobody 

wanted to strip Richard of his badge. 

You have to get close to be good at 

what he did, the trick is not to get 

too close.


MACKELWAY

You knew the arm slash was not 

"Zorro."


KOESSLER

I suspected, but you were the one 

Low contacted. That's why I brought 

you back here.


MACKELWAY

What did you think of the Suspect 

Zero theory?


KOESSLER

It was neither a valid concept nor a 

valid fact. Suspect Zero came to 

represent every killer Dick Low had 

not caught. The idea took root in 

his head like a wild irrational vine. 

For someone like Low, there would 

always be a Suspect Zero. We couldn't 

let Richard go where that idea was 

taking him.


KNOCK on the door; Koessler opens it -- Jaime Kulok sticks 

her head in:


KULOK

Sorry to interrupt you, sir, but I 

thought you'd like to know.


KOESSLER

What?


KULOK

We have another one.


KOESSLER

Another what?


KULOK

Serial killer killed. In Ft. Myers. 

Cut up in his van. And this time we 

got a witness.

CUT TO:


INT. INTERROGATION ROOM DAY


Candy, dressed like a proper young lady, rubbing her sore 

wrists, sits across from Mackelway and a local detective.


CANDY

I wasn't thinking about 

identification. I got out of there 

as fast as I could.


Mack shows her Richard Low's FBI file mug shot: a serious 

man with a short haircut, dark suit and bad tie.


MACKELWAY

Was this him?


CANDY

(looks)

Um... he was older.


MACKELWAY

Besides that.


CANDY

To be honest, when I'm working, I 

don't look at faces much. He knew 

the guy's name.


MACKELWAY

Testa?


CANDY

The bearded guy, the creep. Oh, one 

other thing. Testa, if that's his 

name, he kept mentioning my feet. 

Said I had very pretty feet.


CUT TO:


INT. FT. MYERS MORGUE DAY


Robert Testa's legs, now severed stumps, on the autopsy table. 

His feet have been cut off at the ankles. Testa's throat is 

ripped open like a bloody smile.


Jaime Kulok greets Mackelway as he steps over. The M.E. looks 

up, goes back to work.


MACKELWAY

Find the feet?


KULOK

No. Cut off while he was still alive, 

look at his wrists, damn near ripped 

his hands off trying to get free. 

Must have been screaming real loud 

when the killer chain-sawed his 

throat. Unfortunately, he'd 

soundproofed his van.


MACKELWAY

We got an UNSUB walking around with 

four feet?


KULOK

We did find these, however.


Kulok walks over to a refrigerated case, opens it: a row of 

female feet in various stages of decay stand in a line.


MACKELWAY

Jesus.


KULOK

We're trying to match them with dump 

site bodies.

(points out a foot)

This we know is Carol Delview from 

Tampa, found her last Spring. This 

one --


Mack looks at the next, a small, relatively fresh foot: a 

long rose tattoo is severed in half.


MACKELWAY

The tattoo?


KULOK

Sue Ann Hanson.


MACKELWAY

You mean --


KULOK

You found the body. She was one of 

Harold Speck's victims. In El Paso.

(lets this sink in)

They're not just talking to each 

other, Mack, they're trading 

souvenirs.


Mack closes the refrigerated case, walks several steps, turns:


MACKELWAY

Did they disconnect Testa's computer?


KULOK

Not yet. This time they're waiting 

for you.


Jaime looks at the refrigerated case, thinks about the 

victims. Her composure slips a little. Mack walks over, 

discreetly, touches her hand:


MACKELWAY

I know.


Jaime nods.


CUT TO:


INT. KOESSLER'S OFFICE DAY


Deputy Director Koessler looks through a folder: Testa's 

autopsy photos, crime scene diagrams and a montage of severed 

feet. Mackelway and Kulok bring him up to speed:


MACKELWAY

I got a look in Testa's computer. 

His screen name was "Imelda." Have 

to give him that, had a sense of 

humor.


KOESSLER

Collected shoes too?


KULOK

You should have seen the store manager 

at Parade of Shoes. She was 

inconsolable.


MACKELWAY

Murman and Imelda had been slipping 

into a private chat room. Low had 

poor old Testa drooling on the 

keyboard. Abduction fantasies, 

voyeurism, mutilation, teasing him 

with fetish elements. He is very 

good. I think it's safe to say Richard 

Low is Murman.


KOESSLER

We're waiting for trace evidence 

results on the Rice killing.


MACKELWAY

We need to put out an NCIC inquiry.


KOESSLER

How do you send out an APB on a dead 

man?


MACKELWAY

Huh?, sir.


KOESSLER

I want to catch Dick Low, more than 

you can imagine, but I cannot risk 

going public. What happens when the 

media finds out that a former FBI 

Special Agent, a founder of the 

Behavioral Sciences Unit, is not 

dead, but instead alive and killing 

people, not ordinary people, but, 

even worse, serial killers, making 

him some sort of white knight 

vigilante?

(beat)

You keep at it. We'll find him, we'll 

find him in our own way.

INT. FBI PARKING STRUCTURE DAY


Mack and Jaime walk and talk past rows of similar cars. He 

says something; she laughs. He waits for her to get in her 

car, walks on.


Over we hear his voice pre-lap from a late night chat room 

session:


MACKELWAY (O.S.)

There was something about her. She 

was the one. She was checking at 

WalMart, just going about her 

business, giving everyone a big smile 

in that cute I'm-so-perfect-and-you're-

such-a-loser way, her full titties 

popping around in her bra...


CUT TO:


EXT. MALL PARKING LOT NIGHT


Night in a northern climate: snow falls on a HIGH SCHOOL 

COUPLE, the last to leave the closing suburban mall. Carrying 

shopping bags, they walk toward their parked car.


SUSPECT ZERO steps down into frame. We see his face: a square-

shouldered mid-thirtiesh white male in navy vinyl jacket. He 

watches the couple. The BOY glances at him, looks away as if 

seeing nothing unusual.


Zero's POV approaches:


ZERO (O.S.)

Is the mall closed already?


The GIRL senses something, sees something. She starts to 

run. The Boy, dropping his bag, confronts Zero. HIT with a 

heavy object, the Boy staggers back, FALLS to the ground, 

his mouth bleeding.


The Girl runs. Zero's POV chases the screaming girl, looking 

back as she runs, still carrying her shopping bag. Ahead, 

through the snow, is a three-lane road; car lights flash 

past. The Girl, screaming for attention, SLIPS in the snow, 

falls. Gets up, FALLS again. Looks up.


Zero's POV: he has her.


Chat room dialogue continues over:


RIPPER (O.S.)

[Fuck her. Fuck her.]


MURMAN (O.S.)

[Shut up.]


MACKELWAY (O.S.)

Little Miss Perfect, clean hair, 

clean teeth, clean mind, not a fucking

Mack, aka Lionheart, seated, speaks into the microphone above 

the computer screen. Murman, Zin, Ripper, All4You, BelaKiss, 

Berzerkr and Daemon are logged on in an Incan Architecture 

room. The Eastern Standard clock reads 12:45.


Mackelway has installed a corkboard featuring Missing Persons 

reports of young females. Karen Sumpter smiles from a sea of 

lost persons. Beneath, professional and pop books on the 

criminal mind and serial killers are stacked beside assorted 

violent pornography.


MACKELWAY

She never had to go without or beg 

for anything, got whatever she wanted. 

Well, she was begging now...


Agent Mackelway, seated, speaks, bathed in computer glow. 

He's lost in the moment, given over to an escalating fantasy. 

He's good at it.


MACKELWAY

I grabbed her from behind when she 

walked in, put an arm lock on her 

throat, double duct-taped her hands 

and mouth. She actually put up a 

good fight for someone so small. 

When she saw the scissors, her eyes 

just grew big. She couldn't breathe. 

Let me help you, I said, cut open 

her T-shirt and bra as her titties 

came out. She was mine now. Cut off 

her panties, little orange and blue 

flowers, bought them right there, at 

the department store...


CUT TO:


INT. MACKELWAY'S APT NIGHT


Jaime, dressed casually, pushes open the door, calls:


KULOK

Mack? Mack?


She hears his voice in the distance, sees light coming from 

under the door to his computer room. He voice grows clearer:


MACKELWAY (O.S.)

I played with her awhile till I got 

hard. Took myself out, played with 

myself -- made her watch, put her 

face in it. Afraid? -- I'll teach 

you fear. Turn over, bitch. That 

hurts, huh? Take the pain, take the 

pain!...


Jaime silently opens the door to the computer room, SEES --


CUT TO:


INT. COMPUTER ROOM NIGHT


Mack, sweat glistening on the back of his neck, rapt in 

cyberspace, deep in fantasy, speaking to the screen:


MACKELWAY

What am I gonna do? I'm gonna cut 

you open, bitch. Kill you then cut 

your titties off.


Mackelway senses Kulok's presence, turns and sees her. Livid, 

frightened, trembling, he turns off the voice actualizer, 

YELLS like Dr. Jekyll caught holding Hyde's vial:


MACKELWAY

Don't ever come in here! How dare 

you come in here! Get out!


Jaime, speechless, bolts and runs away.


Mackelway, suddenly aware, overcome with remorse, calls:


MACKELWAY

Jaime, Jaime.


He YANKS out the voice actualizer, THROWS it to the floor, 

switches off the mainframe: the screens go black.


Mack, alone, lit by blue glow, listens as the front door 

closes.


CUT TO:


INT. KULOK'S APT NIGHT


Mackelway, wearing a sports jacket, rings apartment doorbell.


MACKELWAY

Jaime, open up. It's me, Mack.

(no response)

Jaime.


Kulok opens the door, stands by the jamb:


KULOK

Mack, I'm sorry. I apologize. I should 

have called. I had no right to sneak 

in on you like that.


MACKELWAY

No, Jaime, I apologize. I didn't... 

I had no right to speak to you like 

that.


KULOK

I came over because I couldn't sleep 

and was lonely. I wanted to see you. 

I thought I'd surprise you.


MACKELWAY

(sardonic)

You did.


He reaches for her waist. She reluctantly accepts his touch.


KULOK

Maybe we should back off a bit.


MACKELWAY

I can't. They trust me, they accept 

me. I've got their confidence.


KULOK

No, I mean maybe we should back off 

a bit, you and me.


MACKELWAY

Oh.


Mack withdraws his hands.


KULOK

There's the Agency issue. I think 

Koessler may suspect something 

already. We're not on the best footing 

with him as it is.


MACKELWAY

That's true.


KULOK

Then there's the other issue.


MACKELWAY

What's that?


KULOK

You need time to think. About the 

case, about you and me.


MACKELWAY

I found a peephole into Deviant World. 

I'm gonna reach in and yank some of 

those creeps out.


KULOK

And nobody else can do that?


MACKELWAY

Not the way I can.


KULOK

That's my point. Remember, you're a 

cop pretending to be a deviant. It's 

not the other way around.


MACKELWAY

Don't confuse what we do with who we 

are.


KULOK

I just need to go a little slow.


He nods.

Title: "Winona, Minnesota." Spring rains have sent the 

Mississippi River over its banks.


Volunteer crews and Army Corps Engineers sandbag the river 

at the base of a hill in the local cemetery.


A worker atop a backhoe spots something, calls to fellow 

workers. The Supervisor walks over, followed by two 

volunteers. The backhoe driver steps down. Together they 

look at what the river has washed up:


The BODY of Karen Sumpter, Dell City, Texas, still wearing 

her "Oh No, They Killed Kenny!" T-shirt, lies nude from the 

waist down in muck. The remnants of her pantyhose are wrapped 

around her neck. Maggots and their larvae crawl from her 

mouth.


A chat room conversation plays over:


MURMAN (O.S.)

[Lionheart, what happened?]


MACKELWAY (O.S.)

Something came up, Murman, my man.


RIPPER (O.S.)

[But did something come out?]


MACKELWAY (O.S.)

It took both hands to handle it.


RIPPER (O.S.)

[I came just thinking about it.]


CUT TO:


INT. MACK'S COMPUTER ROOM NIGHT


Mack, back in his lair, paces in front of his computer screen. 

He wears a white T-shirt and jeans, towel around his neck:


MACKELWAY

I'm on the move my friends, moving

man with a mission, man with a

[You want to talk, Lionheart, or you 

want to take this a little more 

personal?]


MACKELWAY

Lead the way, Murman.


MURMAN (O.S.)

[Follow me.]


Mack moves his mouse, clicks, enters a private chat room. 

Murman's waiting:


MURMAN (O.S.)

[Chicago's a lively town.]


CUT TO:


INT. LIBRARY DAY


Title: "Omaha, Nebraska." LONG LENS POV: LESLIE REICH, 25, 

khaki slacks and a lavender polo shirt, wanders through a 

local library, enters the stacks. One of those fellows who 

looks absolutely ordinary -- at first glance.


Reich, running his eyes along Dewey Decimal codes, peruses a 

row of art books. He finds the number he is looking for 

("Fauvres"), takes the coffee table book from the shelf.


He opens it: there, inside, as promised, is a Polaroid of a 

dead, partially dressed young woman and, around it, a 

department store gold chain. Reich pockets the photo and 

chain, replaces the illustrated book to the shelf.


Chat room conversation continues over:


MACKELWAY (O.S.)

I've been to Chicago.


MURMAN (O.S.)

[Not this way. Call it a little favor, 

call it a little thing I'm going to 

do for you. I'm going to make Chicago 

come alive for you. You'll owe me 

one.]


MACKELWAY (O.S.)

If I owe, I will go.


MURMAN (O.S.)

[The address is 147 South Rane. It's 

a lively address. You got a problem 

with dark meat?]


MACKELWAY (O.S.)

Haven't had any, but I'm willing to 

try.


MURMAN (O.S.)

[Ask for Leslie. Eight days from 

tonight, exactly one a.m. Be there 

if you dare. You cannot fool the 

Murman.]


CUT TO:


EXT. MOTEL 6 NIGHT


Title: "Chicago, Illinois." A budget two-story motel in a 

less than desirable part of town. Letter sign reads: "Spend 

a Night, Not a Fortune!"


CUT TO:


INT. MOTEL 6 NIGHT


Tom Mackelway, wearing a loose black leather jacket, jeans 

and navy polo, opens his carry-on suitcase. A Chicago map 

lies on the bed.


He places his FBI ID and wallet inside. He removes a snub-

nosed .38 and an ankle holster. He straps on the gun, checks 

his pocket for folding cash.


Mack goes over to the desk and, placing his hands on it, 

looks at himself in the mirror: he's crossing a line here. 

He's come to Chicago undercover, without authorization, to 

procure a criminal act.


CUT TO:


EXT. INNER CITY NIGHT


Quarter to one: Mack drives a rental car through Chicago's 

decaying South Side. He looks at the street sign: "Rane." 

Homeboys pass in a BMW, rap blasting over foreboding 

underscore, give him the eye.


He parks the car at the curb, locks his phone and beeper in 

the glove compartment, checks his gun, gets out.


Checking the house numbers, he walks to a single family 

residence with chain-linked front yard and barred windows.


CUT TO:


EXT. CHICAGO HOUSE NIGHT


Mack cautiously opens the gate, walks toward the porch. 

Discarded children's toys and junk are strewn in the 

moonlight. He steps onto the porch, looks at the curtained 

front window.


How did he get here?


He steels himself, presses the doorbell.


CUT TO:


REICH HOUSE NIGHT


Leslie Reich opens the door. Television plays in manicured 

middle-class living room behind.


Richard Low, now clean shaven, wearing a dark suit and latex 

gloves, speaks to Reich:


LOW

Leslie Reich?


REICH

What is it?


LOW

I'm from the FBI. My name is Murman. 

Agent George Murman.


Reich, at the sound of Murman's name, turns and BOLTS through 

the house.


Low charges after Reich, CHASES him through the living room 

and dining area.


Low TACKLES Reich in the kitchen; they roll across the 

linoleum into the cabinets. Low BANGS Reich's head against 

the floor, pulling a pair of handcuffs from behind his back. 

Low handcuffs Reich, flips him onto his back, stands over 

him. Richard Low pulls up his pant leg, removes a lethal K-

bar knife strapped to his leg.


LOW

Now, Ripper, let's see those home 

movies you've been talking about. 

Where did you say you kept them, oh 

yes, the broom closet.


REICH

What are you going to do to me?


Low snaps the broom closet lock with the K-bar knife: inside 

are neatly arranged shoe box cubicles, each containing a 

labeled VHS tape and some "souvenirs" -- panties, a purse, 

necklace, etc.


LOW

My, my.


Low takes a tape, reads the label: "JEW-ith Gross." Reich 

watches in growing fear as Low takes a plastic apron from 

the refrigerator handle, puts it on.


REICH

(pleading)

I don't know how that got there. I 

don't even live here.


LOW

(kneeling over him)

At least you could have spelled her 

name right.


Low rips open Reich's shirt, raises the K-bar, thrusts 

downward.


CUT TO:


EXT. CHICAGO HOUSE NIGHT


A LARGE BLACK WOMAN opens the door, looks at Mack:


BLACK WOMAN

What you want?


MACKELWAY

I want to speak to Leslie. Murman 

sent me.


BLACK WOMAN

Are you crazy?


MACKELWAY

There's no Leslie here?


BLACK WOMAN

Does this look like a "Leslie" house 

to you?


The Black Woman's HUSBAND approaches wearing his underwear:


HUSBAND

Who the fuck is this?


BLACK WOMAN

The white boy is looking for some 

ho' called Leslie.


HUSBAND

Get the fuck out.


MACKELWAY

I'm sorry, there must have been a 

mistake.


The Husband slams the door in his face. Mack looks around, 

heads down the steps. He's been had, sent on a wild goose 

chase.


CUT TO:


EXT. INNER CITY NIGHT


Mack unlocks his rental car, gets in. He removes his beeper 

and phone from the glove compartment; there's a message.


He starts the engine, drives off. Riding through the empty 

streets, he phones a 402 area code number. Kulok's sleepy 

voice answers:


KULOK (O.S.)

Hello?


MACKELWAY

Jaime? Where are you?


KULOK (O.S.)

Where are you? Everybody's looking 

for you.


MACKELWAY

What's up?


KULOK (O.S.)

I'm in Omaha. Get to the airport. 

There's been another one.


CUT TO:


INT. OMAHA MORGUE DAY


Mackelway and Kulok walk down a corridor to the examination 

room. She hands him an 8x10 of the Reich crime scene: Leslie 

Reich, wearing only pants, lies face up on his bed. His upper 

torso has been ripped open from sternum to pubis. Around 

Reich's body are arranged VHS tapes and "souvenirs." One is 

the gold chain he got in the library.


KULOK

The videos were home movies, kills 

of girls that had been gutted, dumped 

here, Iowa, Kansas.


They enter the examination room, step to the table where DR. 

ZABRISKIE, the Medical Examiner, waits beside Reich's body.


KULOK

Dr. Zabriskie, this is Agent 

Mackelway.


They greet.


ZABRISKIE

A fairly straightforward job. A clean 

surgical incision to the heart, down 

through the diaphragm.


MACKELWAY

In other words --


ZABRISKIE

The victim bled out. The heart at 

some point was removed.


KULOK

But I can see it. It's still there.


ZABRISKIE

It was put back in.


MACKELWAY

Why?


ZABRISKIE

Good question. Maybe because of this. 

We found it underneath the heart.


Dr. Zabriskie walks over to counter, picks up a red-stained 

baggie, holds it up. Inside the baggie is a man's wristwatch.


Mack pales: it's his wristwatch, stolen by Low in Socorro.


MACKELWAY

That bastard.


Mack turns, walks a few steps.


ZABRISKIE

What?


KULOK

It's complicated.


She steps beside Mackelway.


MACKELWAY

My watch. He toyed with me. He sent 

me to Chicago.


KULOK

You want to get him? Find something 

he wants. Get him to come to you.


MACKELWAY

Start killing people for real?


KULOK

Suspect Zero.


MACKELWAY

That's a crackpot theory. Everybody 

says so.


KULOK

But he believes in it. That's all 

that matters. He toyed with you, you 

toy with him. Convince him you've 

got a lead on Suspect Zero. Use Zero, 

you'll find Low.


Mack looks at Reich's body.


MURMAN (O.S.)

[Sorry about Chi-town, Lionheart...]


CUT TO:


INT. MACK'S COMPUTER ROOM NIGHT


A "Needlepoint" chat room: Mack back online with his cybersex 

buddies--Zin, Murman, Troll, All4You, BelaKiss.


MURMAN (O.S.)

[If you wanted a good steak, you 

should have gone to Omaha.]


MACKELWAY

Let's go someplace private, Murman, 

I have something for you.


TROLL (O.S.)

[Haven't you forgotten something?]


ZIN (O.S.)

[Yeah, us.]


MURMAN (O.S.)

[Follow me, Lionheart.]


Mack moves his mouse, clicks it: he's alone in a PRIVATE 

ROOM with Murman.


MACKELWAY

Let's talk about Zero.


MURMAN (O.S.)

[Hello, Agent Mackelway. How's the 

watch? Maybe you can do one of those 

TV commercials, I found my watch 

under a serial killer's heart and it 

was still ticking.]


MACKELWAY

I want to help you.


MURMAN (O.S.)

[Not the heart, the watch.]


Mack stands, looks at the corkboard as he speaks. He has 

added an internal FBI evaluation of Low, old Green River 

documents, a clipping about Low's plane crash.


MACKELWAY

I've located the Suspect Zero file. 

Did you know there was one? Koessler 

ordered it as part of your evaluation.


MURMAN (O.S.)

[Don't jerk a jerk-off. There's 

nothing in the Bureau mainframe.]


MACKELWAY

Not everything is imputed to memory. 

The most confidential stuff is kept 

top secret hard copy. Why would the 

Zero file be kept secret?


MURMAN (O.S.)

[You tell me.]


MACKELWAY

George Sheldon? The second serial 

killer killed in the manner of his 

killings. The crime scene profile 

was never entered into VICAP. At 

whose request? David Koessler.


MURMAN (O.S.)

[What does the file say?]


MACKELWAY

I want to go live with you.


MURMAN (O.S.)

[And I want to go back to 

Needlepoint.]


MACKELWAY

Leave this room, I'll go back with 

you, blow your cover.


MURMAN (O.S.)

[I don't think so. We want the same 

thing. See ya.]


Murman types in a happy face [:-)], logs off private chat. 

Mack's alone in the room.


CUT TO:


INT. KOESSLER'S OFFICE DAY


Mack, in suit and tie, has been "called on the carpet."


KOESSLER

Why did you go to Chicago?


MACKELWAY

I was visiting an old college friend.


KOESSLER

You didn't tell anyone where you 

were?


MACKELWAY

An oversight, sir, I apologize. I 

felt I needed to get away for a day. 

The pressure. Paid for my own ticket.


KOESSLER

I'm told you've asked for a Bureau 

cross-check of flight records to and 

from El Paso, Ft. Myers, Omaha, the 

Murman murder time frames.


MACKELWAY

I was looking for a pattern.


KOESSLER

That breaks my confidentiality 

stipulation.


MACKELWAY

I didn't use Low's name.


KOESSLER

There was talk of a file photo.


MACKELWAY

In Ft. Myers before your instruction. 

Nowhere else, sir.


Mack has violated no stipulations; Koessler knows this. What 

Koessler has on his mind is less official, more personal:


KOESSLER

Watch out for Dick Low, he's a liar; 

he has his own world. There was a 

Junior Agent in Seattle, not unlike 

you, an Agent who fell under Dick's 

spell. He'd have done anything for 

Agent Low. Richard got this Agent to 

take a suspect to the crime scene, 

beat him up, force a confession -- 

all unauthorized, all illegal.

(beat)

The Agent died that night, killed by 

the suspect. Richard Low got him 

killed. Worst of all, we had to hush 

it up, let the suspect go. The suspect 

was George Sheldon, the second man 

Richard killed.


MACKELWAY

I understand.


KOESSLER

As far as the public knows, Richard 

Low is dead. And he will stay dead 

until we kill him.


CUT TO:


INT. PARKING STRUCTURE DAY


Mack's cell phone rings as he enters his car. He answers:


LOW (O.S.)

Agent Mackelway?


MACKELWAY

Yes.


LOW (O.S.)

This is Richard Low. Stay on the 

phone. Do not disconnect. I'm watching 

you. I will instruct you where to 

drive.


MACKELWAY

(looking around)

Yes, sir.


LOW (O.S.)

When you exit, head east on 10th.


Mackelway pulls out, drives toward the parking attendant 

booth.


CUT TO:


EXT. WASHINGTON D.C. DAY


Mackelway's sedan drives past the Jefferson Memorial, crosses 

the George Mason Bridge headed south.


LOW (O.S.)

Follow the signs to Arlington.


CUT TO:


EXT. ARLINGTON DAY


Mack's sedan weaves its way along the asphalt roads. Low has 

selected Arlington for an obvious reason: a 360 degree 

panorama makes it possible to see anyone coming.


LOW (O.S.)

Pull to the side and wait.


Mack does as instructed.


LOW (O.S.)

Kill the engine. Drop the keys outside 

the window.


He does.


LOW (O.S.)

All right, get out of the vehicle, 

leave your weapon on the front seat. 

Place your arms atop the vehicle, 

spread your legs.


Mackelway complies. As he stands there, a green pickup drives 

up. Low, wearing work clothes, stops, speaks out the open 

passenger window:


LOW

Don't move.


Low gets out, frisks Mackelway: he's clean.


LOW

Get in.


Mack sits in the passenger seat; Low gets behind the wheel, 

drives off.


CUT TO:


INT./EXT. LOW'S PICKUP DAY


Richard Low drives through rolling fields of white military 

tombstones. An automatic weapon hangs in Low's side holster.


LOW

Dave Koessler must have you jumping 

through hoops.


MACKELWAY

I believe it is you, sir, who has us 

jumping through hoops.


LOW

How's the arm?


MACKELWAY

I've been reading, hearing about 

you. I spoke to Koessler, Professor 

Daitz.


LOW

He couldn't break an egg with a 

hammer. He still writing those crime 

porn books?


MACKELWAY

He's moved on to TV.


LOW

He always had a weakness in that 

area. I saw it the first time I met 

him. We all had our weaknesses, I 

guess. Daitz wanted the money. With 

Dave it was the glory. Koessler saw 

the Behavioral Sciences Unit as a 

stepping stone to bigger and better 

bureaucratic things. He had his eye 

on the Director's job, even then. 

Catching killers was a means to an 

end for them.


Low slows to a stop, parks the pickup under an oak tree. 

Throughout the ensuing conversation, his eyes roam from the 

rear view to the side mirrors.


MACKELWAY

What was your weakness, sir?


LOW

I'm not sure, exactly. I had monsters 

on the brain. I wanted to get these 

guys, every one of them. I got 

obsessive.


MACKELWAY

Suspect Zero?


LOW

Deputy Director Koessler opposed the 

theory because it meant pressing the 

legal envelope, risking high-profile 

failure. Better to get rid of me. 

Then he could be Mr. Serial Killer, 

Mr. Authority on Deviant Behavior -- 

no embarrassing questions about the 

contribution of one Richard Low. Do 

you really think that plane crashed 

by accident? Do you really think I 

wasn't on it by accident? I've always 

had a good sense of intuition.


MACKELWAY

So you went underground?


LOW

Was I afraid of Dave Koessler? Not 

likely. I told you, I'd gotten a bit 

obsessive. It was an opportunity to 

back off, think things through.

(beat)

Where's the file?


MACKELWAY

I don't carry it with me.


LOW

You're a smart guy. Tell me what it 

says.


MACKELWAY

"Agent Low's theory of Suspect Zero, 

the undetected serial killer, is 

delusional, the product of good 

intentions, paranoia and obsession..."


Low mimics playing a violin:


LOW

Hum a tune and I'll sing to it.


MACKELWAY

The file, however, was kept open 

after your death. NPE disappearances, 

No Plausible Explanation, were 

sometimes filed there, deleted if 

the bodies were found.


Low reaches under the seat, removes an 8x10 envelope, hands 

it to Mack.


MACKELWAY

What's this?


Mack's hand reaches too far, almost bumps into Richard Low. 

Low responds by SNAPPING out his automatic in an eye flash, 

PRESSING the barrel against Mackelway's cheek. His head is 

squeezed against the back of the truck. Mack is suddenly 

reminded what a dangerous situation this is; he apologizes 

with a nod. Low backs off.


Or is this just a manipulation on Low's part, playing Mack 

like he does that imaginary violin?


LOW

(holsters pistol)

It's my master list of missing 

persons: men, boys, girls, children 

over the last ten years. Two hundred 

and eighty-five names. A pool of 

possible victims.


MACKELWAY

Zero killed them all?


LOW

Of course not. They're possibles. 

I've checked them against Bureau 

records, check them against your 

file. How did you get it?


MACKELWAY

Daitz hinted it existed. It was a 

matter of forming the request in the 

proper terms.


Low smiles knowingly: Bureauese. Knows it well.


LOW

After my hiatus, after I got my 

priorities readjusted, I drifted 

online, started tracking porn chat 

rooms, looking for Zero. Got accepted, 

came across these boys swapping 

stories, pictures, downloads. Never 

found Zero, but I did come across 

some Class A scumbags.


MACKELWAY

How do you know who's real and who's 

not?


LOW

And who else did I find? Agent Thomas 

Mackelway, crackerjack FBI techie. I 

was greatly disappointed when you 

were re-assigned.


MACKELWAY

You knew it was me all along?


LOW

Please. You can't hide from me, sonny. 

I invented the questionnaire. I can 

tell those who talk from those who 

do it in the time it takes you to 

fart.


Mack has opened Low's master list. He goes through the names 

and the pictures. Some are those he has on his corkboard. In 

the S's he finds Karen Sumpter, Dell City, Texas.


LOW

There's someone out there, Mack, I 

know, some man killing for the fun 

of it, sniffing human glue, without 

regard to age or sex, without 

predicable M.O. Someone who has a 

way to dispose of the bodies. You 

have access, you can call up local 

authorities, check morgues, conduct 

interviews. Be my man.


MACKELWAY

I already have an employer.


LOW

If you won't do it for me, do it for 

your cousin, Nadine, right? The girl 

in the pink sweater.


MACKELWAY

Who told you about her?


LOW

You did. You were with her when she 

disappeared, right? She took you to 

the mall or the movies, you turn 

around and she's gone.


MACKELWAY

It was the mall.


LOW

I know you, Lionheart. I watched 

your mind work, heard your dirty 

thoughts --


MACKELWAY

(defensive)

Those were just fantasies.


Low smirks, as if to say: "My point exactly":


LOW

We're alike. We are hunters. We have 

the gift. It's ancient times all 

over again. We stand between order 

and chaos. I need help. I can't carry 

on alone.


MACKELWAY

Maybe you should back off.


LOW

This guy, Zero, he drifts around, 

that's how they all start, drifting 

around, their minds filling up with 

fantasies. He thinks he's real smart, 

laughs at us, laughs at his victims. 

But he has left a trail, and the 

trail is somewhere in those names. 

You know how to reach me.

(starts engine)

Take my advice, when dealing with 

these FBI tight-asses, go by the 

book. That's what I did.


MACKELWAY

You? You went by the book?


LOW

Yeah, problem was, I had the only 

copy. See ya.


Mack, holding the envelope, gets out. Richard Low drives 

off.


CUT TO:


INT. MACK'S COMPUTER ROOM DAY


It's daytime in Mackelway's lair, but how would you know it?


Mack has reorganized his bulletin board. Low's master list 

is tacked across the wall. Below, faxed photos of possible 

victims correspond to Low's list. Karen Sumpter's "Oh No, 

They Killed Kenny!" picture is tacked over her Missing Persons 

form.


Mack thinks, dials phone. An official voice answers:


OFFICER (O.S.)

Hudspeth County Police.


MACKELWAY

Sheriff Dylan, please.


Mack, looking at the bulletin board, waits. Dylan picks up 

the phone:


DYLAN (O.S.)

Dylan here.


MACKELWAY

Sheriff Dylan, this is FBI Agent 

Thomas Mackelway. Remember me?


DYLAN (O.S.)

Hi there.


MACKELWAY

I want to talk about the Karen Sumpter 

case.


DYLAN (O.S.)

You heard?


MACKELWAY

What?


DYLAN (O.S.)

Her body turned up. In a Minnesota 

cemetery. They brought her back.


Mack looks at several newly received autopsy photos of 

desiccated corpses. Their names match three of those on Low's 

list.


MACKELWAY

You have the body?


DYLAN (O.S.)

She's buried.


MACKELWAY

I want the autopsy report, where is 

it, Minnesota?


DYLAN (O.S.)

Winona.


CUT TO:


INT. SHOOTING RANGE DAY


BANG, BANG, BANG. Mack, wearing sound muffler earphones, 

squeezes off a half-dozen rounds from an automatic pistol, 

piercing a unisex cardboard target.


Setting the gun down, he turns, sees Kulok waiting for him. 

Jaime starts to speak. He gestures for her to watch what she 

says.


KULOK

This feels like something out of a 

spy novel.


MACKELWAY

I guess I'm a little paranoid.


KULOK

What's going on?


He hands in his pistol and headset. They step outside.


CUT TO:


EXT. FBI ACADEMY/QUANTICO DAY


They exit the shooting range, walk through the campus-like 

setting.


MACKELWAY

I met with Richard Low.

(hands her envelope)

These are names of missing persons 

he has flagged. I'm double-checking 

every case, but I don't want to be 

too obvious about it. I marked the 

ones I'd like you to work on.


KULOK

Slow down a second, you met with Low --


MACKELWAY

You were right. He found me.


KULOK

And you're working with him?


MACKELWAY

I need something tangible. To hook 

him. I told him I'd found the 

confidential file on the Suspect 

Zero theory.


KULOK

Does one exist?


MACKELWAY

Probably. I told him Koessler had 

ordered the report, kept it secret.


KULOK

Koessler doesn't know any of this?


MACKELWAY

I've decided to investigate Low's 

plane crash. While I'm at it, I 

thought I'd look at the cases Koessler 

worked with Low.


Jaime lets out a long exhale:


KULOK

I'd be real careful if I were you.


MACKELWAY

It's too late for that. I've gone 

ahead of the curve on this one. 

There's no turning back. When this 

is over, Koessler is going to be 

right or Low is going to be right or 

I'm going to be right, but not all 

of us.


KULOK

It's okay to be wrong, just don't be 

dead wrong.


MACKELWAY

They say Richard Low is wrong, but 

because of him, women, innocent women, 

are alive who would be dead.


KULOK

You're putting me in a difficult 

position.


MACKELWAY

I got an autopsy report from El Paso 

that doesn't seem right. A girl on 

Low's list. Karen Sumpter. We're 

getting a court order to exhume to 

body. I'd like you to come and look 

at it.

(off her look)

Don't worry, I've cleared it.


Kulok agrees.


MACKELWAY

Jaime, do you think, when this is 

all over, when we're in different 

divisions, you think maybe you and 

me, we could try again?


KULOK

(touched but uncertain)

Mack, I'm just trying to keep up 

with now.


He nods. They continue.


CUT TO:


INT. ZERO KILL SPACE NIGHT


Camera frame shakes as it approaches the Girl from the snowy 

mall parking lot, partially nude, dead, eyes and mouth open, 

lying on a metal box-like grid. Her skin is blue.


Camera continues: seated on the floor, also dead, is her 

boyfriend. His head jumps; the body is yanked to the floor.


Suspect Zero stands over him.


Chat room conversation plays over -- with a difference. 

Murman's voice is the natural voice of Richard Low; 

Mackelway's voice is metallic.


TROLL (O.S.)

[Where is the Ripper? Maybe on a 

tripper.]


MACKELWAY AKA LIONHEART (O.S.)

[Lionheart on a tripper. Something 

dead has come up. Will return with 

goodies.]


TROLL (O.S.)

[I feel the need, the need to bleed.]


MURMAN AKA LOW

I have come across some photos, photos 

I have not seen before...


CUT TO:


INT. LOW'S COMPUTER ROOM NIGHT


We are in Richard Low's lair: dim, sinister. It vibes fear 

and death.


Low hunches over a computer screen in what appears to be a 

basement. A second screen permanently monitors communications 

to and from the FBI's NCIC mainframe in Washington D.C. The 

only light comes from the monitors. He types, speaks:


MURMAN AKA LOW

You will benefit from my many years 

of selfless research into a subject 

that interests us all...


Low double-clicks the scanner icon, places a photo into his 

scanner. The first is a polaroid of a naked girl, face down, 

her back cut open.


MURMAN AKA LOW

These pictures may even bring back 

pleasant memories.


The image begins to download.


CUT TO:


INT. EL PASO MORGUE DAY


Title: "El Paso, Texas." George Eaglefoot, the El Paso M.E., 

stands with Mack and Kulok as an attendant wheels out Karen 

Sumpter's body.


EAGLEFOOT

The family has gone through a lot. 

Their daughter missing, the search, 

her body found, the funeral -- then 

this order to exhume the corpse.


MACKELWAY

I'm sorry. This won't take long.


EAGLEFOOT

The body was embalmed. I don't 

understand --


MACKELWAY

Turn the body over. There was 

something in the autopsy report, 

yes, here.

(to Kulok)

These burn marks.


EAGLEFOOT

A grill pattern.


MACKELWAY

(growing excitement)

We need to run this through VICAP, 

search for similar burns.


KULOK

That's not going to help. This 

Minnesota autopsy report, either the 

guy was in a hurry or he didn't know 

his ass from his elbow. It's not a 

regular burn. There's crystallization 

in the capillaries. Blood didn't 

clot --

(points to Sumpter's 

thigh)

It's a freezer burn.


EAGLEFOOT

Must get pretty cold in Minnesota.


They look at him like he just wandered in from the 

reservation.


MACKELWAY

But why this pattern?


KULOK

Could be a lot of things. Depends on 

the freezer.

(snaps off gloves)

I'm sorry, Mack, but I don't think 

this is the answer.


CUT TO:


INT. MCDONALDS DAY


Mackelway and Kulok sit in silence, sipping diet sodas, 

nibbling at Chicken McNuggets. A gaggle of high school girls 

gossip and laugh at nearby tables.


Outside the sky is overcast, threatening rain.


KULOK

Tom, you okay?


MACKELWAY

Hardly anyone calls me Tom. Everybody 

calls me Mack. I always liked that.


KULOK

You okay?


MACKELWAY

Yeah, of course.


KULOK

What's going on?


Mack opens his briefcase on an adjoining table, hands her 

several autopsy photos.


MACKELWAY

These two were on Low's lists, like 

Karen Sumpter. Two bodies which had 

been buried, discovered. North 

Carolina, Utah. This victim...


Mack slips an autopsy photo of a skeletonized figure beneath 

Kulok's fries.


MACKELWAY

...dead three years. They were digging 

a basement. Disappears in Iowa, buried 

in North Carolina.

(shows another photo)

This boy, Evans, like Sumpter, was 

brought up by flooding -- the body's 

better preserved.


Mack's eyes go from the grizzly photo to the nearby high 

schoolers.


KULOK

It's quite advanced.


MACKELWAY

Burn marks. The original M.E. listed 

it as "burn residue." Same place, 

the outer thigh, as Karen Sumpter. 

The UNSUB is able to abduct, kill, 

transport and bury without detection.


KULOK

All the same killer?


MACKELWAY

Low calls him Suspect Zero.


KULOK

Suspect Zero is a crackpot theory. 

You said so.


MACKELWAY

That's what Koessler wants us to 

believe. To discredit Low.


KULOK

You're assigned, we're assigned, to 

apprehend Richard Low, not Suspect 

Zero. I have to tell you, Mack, I'm 

not comfortable where you're going.


MACKELWAY

But it was your idea: "use Zero," 

you said, use Zero to get Low.


Kulok's voice is quiet, the implication clear:


KULOK

If you've changed the focus of this 

investigation, I'll have to report 

it.


Mack fidgets, upset:


MACKELWAY

I haven't changed anything.

(shoves photos into 

briefcase)

Damn.


KULOK

I...


MACKELWAY

(stands)

I've got to take a piss.


She watches as he walks to the restrooms. Mack notices someone 

watching from outside, someone SUSPICIOUS. Is he watching 

the high school girls?


CUT TO:


INT. MEN'S ROOM DAY


A father speaks to his son in a stall as Mack zips, steps 

away from the urinal, exits.


CUT TO:


INT. MCDONALDS DAY


Leaving the men's room, Mack again looks out the window. The 

suspicious man has moved on. Across the parking area, a 

REFRIGERATED TRACTOR-TRAILER is unloading crates of fruits 

and vegetables at the rear of a supermarket.


Why hadn't he thought of it before?


He looks for Kulok: out of her seat, she stands by the window 

watching the truck.


Excited, he joins her:


MACKELWAY

Jaime --


KULOK

(shares his excitement)

It's a truck. A refrigerated truck.


MACKELWAY

Zero abducts victims all over the 

country, kills them, keeps them 

refrigerated for days, weeks, even 

months, then buries them hundreds, 

thousands of miles away. Karen Sumpter 

was buried, washed up in a flood. 

Evans was buried. When we get Zero, 

we'll find boneyards all across the 

country.


KULOK

How are we going to find him?


MACKELWAY

Get the routes of all refrigerated 

trucks over the last ten years. We've 

got three disappearance cities and 

dates, three parallel discovery 

cities. Get into the mainframe, let 

it crunch this information.


Mack, grabbing his briefcase, is already on the move. Kulok 

hurries to catch up.


CUT TO:


EXT. INTERSTATE DAY


An enormous eighteen-wheeler. The Peterbuilt cab, belching 

smoke, is all glistening chrome: wheels, grillwork, mirrors.


Coming up the side of the moving cab, past the "Ever Frost" 

logo, Suspect Zero sits behind the wheel. Zero, a thirty-

plus white man with a blank expression and bad teeth, bobs 

his head to a mixture of CB, police band and radio rock.


CUT TO:


INT. LOADING DOCK DAY


A side of BEEF shunts forward, smacking into another side of 

beef. Then another one. A domino chain of frozen bloody 

carcasses. Sides of beef are being loaded by dock workers 

into the rear of Zero's semi. Cold steamy air pours from the 

open truck, mixes with overcast sky.


Zero stands with the DOCK FOREMAN, female, 40. Watching the 

workers, she checks the trucker's log:


FOREMAN

There seems to be a discrepancy.


ZERO

Not a discrepancy, an error. My 

capacity is 5.5 tons, not 6.


FOREMAN

I have 6 tons.


ZERO

Mam, it's my truck. I know my own 

capacity.


FOREMAN

You can't imagine how many men have 

told me that.


ZERO

(toothy laugh)

It's been customized for sleeping 

capacity.


FOREMAN

Oh yes, I see. You must get asked 

this a lot.


ZERO

Not as much as you'd think.


CUT TO:


INT. FBI OFFICE DAY


The elevator opens directly onto the El Paso bullpen; an 

Agent enters. Mackelway, Kulok and SAC Salinas stand around 

a monitor in one of the cubicles. John Duncan and other Agents 

watch from their work stations.


Thunder rolls in the distance; it has begun to rain.


Mack, intent, types his seven digit code followed by screen 

commands. The computer responds.


Masses of information flash across the monitor screen. Mack 

highlights the disappearance and discovery cities (and 

accompanying dates) on a US road grid. He superimposes still 

downloading delivery routes from every trucking company with 

refrigerated trucks, then cross-checks the grids.


If he gets a sufficient number of hits from a certain company, 

he goes back, isolates the refrigerated trucks. From there 

he checks individual deliveries.


The room buzzes with word of mouth accounts of Mackelway's 

search. Duncan, using his seven digit personal code, accesses 

the information on Mack's screen -- APPEARS ON DUNCAN'S 

SCREEN. Other Agents follow suit.


One company, one truck, one license plate, one driver comes 

us repeatedly. Mack isolates the truck and driver, flips to 

the road map grid. Mack gets a hit, then another, then 

another, FASTER AND FASTER -- 37 in all. The driver's name 

is Darryl Hawkins.


Hawkins has been in 37 of Low's disappearance cities on the 

dates of disappearances. He has also been in the three body 

recovery cities.


Mack requests a DMV search on Darryl Hawkins. His Nebraska 

driver's license appears on the screen: Hawkins is Suspect 

Zero. Hawkins' license simultaneously appears on other bullpen 

monitors.


Mackelway speaks as he types:


MACKELWAY

All right, Mr. Hawkins, where are 

you headed?


The computer brings up Hawkins' schedule. Tonight he will be 

in Amarillo.


MACKELWAY

How far is Amarillo?


SALINAS

350 miles.


MACKELWAY

(to screen)

Now, Mr. Hawkins, when last in 

Amarillo, where did you get gas?


Screen processes requests, returns with a refueling time and 

date and amount at the Lone Star Truck Rest.


The date simultaneously appears on Duncan's screen.


CUT TO:


INT. LOW'S COMPUTER ROOM DAY


As it does on Richard Low's second monitor, the one 

permanently connected to the FBI NCIC mainframe. The screen 

indicates he's tracking requests made through Mack's seven 

digit code.


Low, wearing a sleeveless T-shirt, scans the details of Darryl 

Hawkins' Lone Star fueling stop.


On his second computer: Low enters a request for flight 

schedules.


CUT TO:


INT. FBI OFFICE DAY


Mack turns to Salinas:


MACKELWAY

Locate a jet, we're going to Amarillo.


SALINAS

Excuse me, Agent Mackelway?


MACKELWAY

This man, Hawkins, has killed dozens 

of people. Suspect Zero.


Salinas, walking toward his office, looks back:


SALINAS

First, the regional field Agent can 

cover it. Second, it's highly 

speculative. Third, I don't like 

your tone of voice. Fourth, I need 

authorization to commandeer a plane.


Mack, enthusiasm getting the better of his judgment, presses 

on:


MACKELWAY

(calls)

You're the SAC. You pick up the phone, 

you say I want a jet.


Mackelway starts to follow; Kulok tugs at his sleeve:


KULOK

Mack.


Duncan stands to impede Mack's path. Mack brushes past him, 

enters Salinas' office. Salinas is speaking on the phone.


MACKELWAY

I don't think you understand.


SALINAS

(withering)

What is it exactly I don't understand, 

Agent Mackelway?


MACKELWAY

Deputy Director Koessler doesn't 

want Zero. All he cares about is 

Low.


SALINAS

Perhaps you can explain it to him.

(into phone)

It's Agent Mackelway.


Salinas extends the phone. Mack puts the receiver to his 

ear.


KOESSLER (O.S.)

He's got you believing in Zero now 

too.


MACKELWAY

I need to get to Amarillo immediately.


KOESSLER (O.S.)

Have you told Richard Low about 

Amarillo?


MACKELWAY

I can't. The chat room isn't open 

for another five days.


KOESSLER (O.S.)

We'll wait. Get online with Low, 

inform him of Zero's route -- we'll 

set a trap for him.


MACKELWAY

What about Zero, Darryl Hawkins?


KOESSLER (O.S.)

Hawkins isn't the target, Richard 

Low's the target.


MACKELWAY

There's a killer out there -- we 

know who he is. He could be stalking 

now.


KOESSLER

Dick Low's a killer too.


MACKELWAY

You're as crazy as he is! He's right! 

You don't give a damn about saving 

lives at all! Fuck you!


Mack slams down the phone, turns to Salinas:


MACKELWAY

You too.


Mackelway leaves Salinas' office, passes Kulok and Duncan as 

he exits.


KULOK

What happened?


MACKELWAY

I'm going to Amarillo.


Mack walks to the elevator, intentionally not looking back.


CUT TO:


EXT. LONE STAR TRUCK REST NIGHT


Gusts of horizontal rain lash the truck stop. A lightning 

FLASH silhouettes parked tractor-trailers.


The flash recedes, leaving an "Ever Frost" logo illuminated 

by passing headlights. Zero's truck.


CUT TO:


INT. LONE STAR COFFEE SHOP NIGHT


Zero, aka Darryl Hawkins, sips coffee at a booth by the 

window. He looks outside, turns his eyes back to the counter. 

A THIRTIESH MOTHER sits with her TEN YEAR-OLD BOY wearing a 

Bulls T-shirt.


WAITRESS stops at his table:


WAITRESS

More coffee?


ZERO

No thank you, I'm fine.


WAITRESS

(looking out the window)

I don't know how you fellas do it.


ZERO

Mam, just the way you do. One paycheck 

at a time.


WAITRESS

(laughs)

You got that right.


She walks back to the kitchen. Her walk takes Zero's eyes 

back to the Mother and Son.


MOTHER

Finish your sandwich.


BOY

Mom, I have to go.


MOTHER

(to Waitress)

Where are the toilets?


WAITRESS

Around the side. The door's open.


MOTHER

I'll take you.


BOY

I can go myself.

(softer, urgent)

I gotta do number two.


MOTHER

I'll walk you over. You can come 

back by yourself.


The Boy grabs her hand, leads her out the front door.


Zero watches as they SCOOT around the covered corner of the 

building. A second later, the Mother, alone, rushes back, 

glad to be inside.


Zero, leaving a tip, passes the Mother on his way out.


CUT TO:


EXT. INTERSTATE 27 NIGHT


Rain shrouded headlights move slowly north.


Rain splashes against Mackelway's windshield, water drops 

pelt the exterior. Mack, leaning forward, watches the road 

between strokes of the overworked wipers. The police band 

crackles with static.


Lightning flash illuminates a sign: "Amarillo 11 miles."


CUT TO:


INT. RESTROOM NIGHT


Floor level POV: two small feet, pants around the ankles, 

dangle over the edge of the toilet.


Zero silently stands, looks around. The room is deserted. He 

leans, looks down the hall past a sign reading 

"Showers/Lockers." Nothing.


He touches his penis absent-mindedly, the way someone else 

might bite his lip. He steps over to two wall-mounted hand 

dryers, activates them. The dryers create white noise.


He steps toward the Boy's stall. Removes an eight-inch lead-

filled pipe from his pocket, slips it into waistband.


Zero pauses. Something, intuition, a sixth sense born of 

experience, stops him.


Camera glides over stall partition to see what Zero suspects: 

Richard Low, soaking wet, sits atop the toilet bowl. He has 

one arm around the Boy's chest, the other clamped over his 

mouth. He listens.


Outside the stall, Zero walks to the door, opens, closes it.


Inside the stall, Low, gun in hand, leans forward, unlocks 

the stall door, sticks his head out --


CRACK! Zero whacks Low's protruding head with the lead pipe. 

Low, astonished, spins as he falls, watching Zero wide-eyed. 

His head BANGS against the tile floor. He's out cold.


Zero turns to the terrified Boy:


ZERO

Did that man scare you?


The Boy shakes his frightened head "yes."


ZERO

I ain't gonna hurt you. Let's go 

back to your Momma.


The Boy nods as Zero takes his hand.


CUT TO:


INT. HELICOPTER NIGHT


Agents Salinas and Kulok, riding in back of a four seat 

military chopper, look out the windows, straining to see 

through the rainy night.


Salinas, speaking over the headset, points out something to 

Kulok: another helicopter headed toward them.


The two choppers swing in line, head in the same direction.


CUT TO:


EXT. LONE STAR NIGHT


Mackelway, seeing the exit sign, activates his turn signal. 

The eye of the thunderstorm has passed, leaving in its wake 

heavy rain.


Mack, pulling off the interstate, sees the glowing Lone Star 

Truck Rest sign.


Looking around, preparing to stop, he notices a refrigerated 

tractor-trailer pulling away. He looks at the Nebraska license 

plate: it's Hawkins' truck.


Mack follows.


CUT TO:


INT. MEN'S ROOM NIGHT


Richard Low, woozy, regains consciousness. He looks across 

the bathroom floor, realizes where he is. He feels the cut 

on his head, reaches for his pistol, gets up.


Low staggers from the stall, composes himself, looks around: 

not a soul. That's odd.


He pushes open the door --


CUT TO:


EXT. MEN'S ROOM NIGHT


And is greeted by two patrol car SPOTLIGHTS. Squinting through 

the glare and rain, he sees four Texas Rangers, their guns 

aimed at him.


RANGER

Put down your weapon! Now!


Low complies.


RANGER

Raise your arms, get on the ground, 

spread your arms and legs.


Low raises his arms. Hearing a sound, he looks up: two large 

helicopters approach in the distance.


Turning to get on all fours, he sees the frantic Mother going 

from one policeman to another:


MOTHER

Have you seen a boy, ten years old? 

Wearing a Chicago Bulls T-shirt?


The police are too preoccupied with the arrest of Richard 

Low to give her their full attention.


Low spread-eagles on the ground. Police rush over.


CUT TO:


INT. ZERO CAB NIGHT


Zero, riding high in his big rig, listens to the police band.


Reports of a successful apprehension at the truck stop crackle 

from one walkie to the next.


CUT TO:


EXT. REST STOP NIGHT


Salinas and Kulok, wearing FBI rain slickers and plastic 

covered caps, join up with David Koessler and a subordinate 

Agent, also dressed for rain, walking from the second 

helicopter.


They greet; Salinas points out the Rangers. They walk to 

where Rangers hold Low, drenched, open cut on his head. Low 

turns to Deputy Director Koessler:


LOW

Miss me, Dave?


KOESSLER

(to Rangers)

Thank you, Rangers.

(to Salinas and 

subordinate Agent)

Put this man in the unmarked.


Salinas and the Agent escort Low. The frantic Mother, going 

from officer to officer, catches Jaime's attention.


Salinas opens the rear door of the unmarked, prepares to put 

Low inside. Low turns to Koessler:


LOW

I hope you're wearing a prophylactic, 

Dave, cause you just fucked yourself.


Koessler grabs Low's head, BANGS it against the top of the 

car, RAMS him inside, SLAMS the door.


KOESSLER

(to Kulok)

I'll drive.

(to Salinas)

Arrange a lead and follow car.


CUT TO:


INT. MACK'S CAR NIGHT


Mackelway, following Zero's eighteen wheeler, listens to the 

police band: suspect taken into custody at rest stop, is 

being transported to Amarillo.


CUT TO:


INT./EXT. UNMARKED CAR NIGHT


Three pairs of headlights drive a two-lane road toward 

Amarillo; the unmarked car flanked by two police vehicles.


Inside, Koessler drives; Kulok rides shotgun. In the back, 

Low, handcuffed, winces. Watery blood drips into his eyes.


LOW

(to Kulok)

Agent...


KULOK

Kulok.


LOW

Agent Kulok, could you wipe my face?


KOESSLER

(stern)

Don't you touch him.


LOW

(to Koessler)

You better hope the Director doesn't 

stop abruptly one day, David, you 

might break your nose.


KOESSLER

You're a disgrace to law enforcement, 

to the Bureau -- and to me.


LOW

How did a girl like me end up in a 

place like this?

(to Kulok)

The Deputy Director here, he believes 

in Tough Love. A cop's cop. Shape up 

or ship out, righto? Agent Kulok, 

when you get a chance you might want 

to check the victims of the recent 

serials. You'll find that some of 

them have been credited to other 

killers, some years ago. That's a 

Dave Koessler trick, find a pliant 

sociopath, preferably a dead one, 

attribute to him unsolved cases, 

clean up the backlog-looks great in 

the yearly report.


Koessler has to restrain himself to keep from reaching over 

the seat and hitting Low again:


KOESSLER

You are so fucked up.


LOW

Suspect Zero, now there's an idea 

that doesn't look good on paper --


Koessler speaks into the two-way:


KOESSLER

Agent Salinas, you can proceed to 

Amarillo. Instruct the lead car to 

follow you.


Kulok, concerned, looks at Koessler: what's going on? There's 

a beat before Salinas responds:


SALINAS (O.S.)

Yes, sir.


LOW

Shot trying to escape. How convenient.


Koessler watches as the lead and follow cars pull out, proceed 

ahead without them.


LOW

When I was at the rest stop, there 

was a young boy, maybe ten, and his 

mother. Darryl Hawkins, Zero, abducted 

the boy in the men's room. I tried 

to stop him. He cold-cocked me --


KOESSLER

Listen to this guy? Can you believe 

this? He'll never change. Born a 

liar, first word out of his mouth 

was a lie. Make up a story, always a 

story, any goddamn story, to save 

his ass.


Low, realizing he has a more sympathetic listener in Jaime, 

directs his comments to her:


LOW

Agent Kulok, that boy, as we speak, 

is in Hawkins' truck, probably still 

alive, in a dark refrigerated 

compartment, shivering in just a T-

shirt: put yourself in his mind, 

freezing, terrified, wanting his 

mother. Put yourself in his mother's 

place, desperate, imagining the worst 

is happening as she pleads, back 

there at the rest stop, for someone, 

anyone, to listen to her. This is 

not hypothetical, this is real. It 

is happening now and you can do 

something about it.


KOESSLER

Shut the fuck up or I'll shut you 

up.


LOW

(to Kulok)

You have to save this boy. Good exists 

in this world. I can prove it because 

you can, in your life, save this one 

person.


Koessler's had as much of this as he can take. He pulls to 

the side of the road.


Koessler puts the car into park; his left hand opens the 

jacket covering his shoulder holster. If Jaime is to act, it 

must be now.


She removes her automatic, POINTS it at her boss:


KULOK

Deputy Director, get out, sir.


KOESSLER

What are you doing?


KULOK

Please.


Koessler looks at her gun, realizes she is serious:


KOESSLER

Mackelway, I could understand. He is 

over-emotional by nature, but you, 

Agent Kulok, you had a shining career 

in front of you.


KULOK

Just step outside, sir. Now. Keep 

your hands where I can see them.


Koessler looks from Low to Kulok to Low.


KULOK

If you're wondering, yes, I will use 

this weapon if necessary.


Koessler has no choice. Keeping his hands visible, he opens 

the door, steps out. He turns to Low:


KOESSLER

Dick, you may fool this girl here, 

you may fool Mackelway, but you'll 

never fool me.


Koessler exits. Jaime, sliding behind the wheel, locks the 

door. She drops the car into gear, PULLS AWAY, leaving 

Koessler alone in the rain.


Richard Low, watching Koessler, acting like he's suddenly in 

charge:


LOW

Okay, swing this thing around. Put a 

BOLO out on Hawkins. Peterbuilt 18 

wheeler, Nebraska license number 

TRV437. He'll be headed west on I-

40.


Kulok slows, does a 180. She turns on the red flashing dash 

light, hits the siren.


LOW

Unlock these cuffs.


KULOK

Sit back.


She accelerates west.


CUT TO:


INT./EXT. ZERO AND MACK NIGHT


Zero, listening to the police band, listens to Kulok's "Be 

On the LookOut" regarding his Peterbuilt. He decides to exit.


Mackelway watches as Zero's turn signals flash. He follows 

the huge truck down the Exit 29 ramp.


Mack keys his walkie:


MACKELWAY

This is Officer Tom. Urgent 

communication for Dr. Kulok: zero-x-

two-inner...


Zero, listening, doesn't pick up on the code.


CUT TO:


INT. ZERO KILL SPACE NIGHT


The Boy, hands bound, lies in a ball on the floor, trying to 

conserve the little body heat that remains. He blue lips 

tremble.


MACKELWAY (O.S.)

...repeat, zero-x-two-niner.


Across the dark space, barely visible, the frozen carcasses 

of the High School Couple hang against the wall.


CUT TO:


INT./EXT. KULOK AND LOW NIGHT


Listening to Mack's message.


LOW

Zero's exiting at Exit 29.


Kulok responds on the radio:


KULOK

Ten four. En route with Low.


She puts down the radio mike.


KULOK

Mack must think Zero has a police 

band.


LOW

Of course he does. Now get the key, 

get these things off me.

(she ignores him)

Unhook me.


Jaime watches a passing sign: "Exit 28, 1 mile. Exit 29, 21 

miles."


A flash of HOSTILITY colors Low's voice:


LOW

Uncuff me. What's wrong with you? 

Don't you want to save the boy?


KULOK

I want to protect the boy. I also 

want to protect Suspect Zero -- from 

you.


CUT TO:


EXT. STATE ROAD NIGHT


Zero slows his truck on an empty highway, turns onto a 

deserted access road. He climbs out of the cab carrying a 

flashlight, walks through the rain to the back of the eighteen 

wheeler.


Stretching the key from his belt, Zero unlocks the padlock, 

opens the rear of the truck. Cold air flows into the humid 

night.


He steps up between hung beef carcasses.


CUT TO:


EXT. MACK'S CAR NIGHT


Mackelway cuts the headlights, drives cautiously toward the 

rear lights of Zero's truck.


He parks his sedan, cuts the engine.


CUT TO:


INT. ZERO'S KILL SPACE NIGHT


Pushing aside slabs of beef, Zero uses the flashlight to 

illuminate a hidden entrance at the far end of the freezer 

compartment. He unlocks it; the door opens to his kill space.


The terrified Boy looks into Zero's flashlight beam.


ZERO

You all right?


Zero pulls a killing knife from his boot.


ZERO

You ever cut up animals, son? Watch 

'em bleed, watch the life flow out 

of them?


CUT TO:


EXT. TRUCK NIGHT


Mackelway, gun in hand, walks toward the open rear doors of 

Zero's Peterbuilt. A work light silhouettes the carcasses.


Mack wipes the rain from his eyes, approaches the truck. 

Looking, listening, he climbs inside.


He steps between slabs of beef, inches forward. He can see a 

moving shadow behind the partially open door at the far end.


He hears Zero's voice:


ZERO (O.S.)

This is gonna hurt.


Mack, gun leading the way, inches toward the kill space. 

Bracing himself, he KICKS open the door, aims the gun at 

Zero:


MACKELWAY

Put the knife down, Hawkins.

(Zero hesitates)

Put the knife down!


Zero reluctantly lowers the blade to the floor.


MACKELWAY

(to the Boy)

Son, can you hear me? Do you 

understand what I'm saying?

(Boy nods)

Good. Come this way, past me, get 

out of this truck.


The Boy seizes the opportunity. He RUNS away from Zero, 

straight into Mack, BUMPING him as he struggles to exit the 

kill space.


Mackelway, spun back by the Boy, doesn't see Zero coming.


Zero CHOPS Mack's wrist. His gun falls as the Boy escapes.


Zero powerfully wrenches Mack's hands behind him, yanks him 

backward, reaches for his knife.


Mack breaks free, turns around. Zero, knife in hand, has him 

CORNERED. Mack's gun is out of reach. Mack speaks to Zero:


MACKELWAY

I'm Agent Thomas Mackelway, FBI. 

There is no way you will escape. 

Assistant Deputy Director Richard 

Low is en route with another Agent.

(Zero doesn't react)

You may know Low by another name. 

You may know him by the name Murman. 

I am Lionheart.


ZERO

(disdain)

Murman!


MACKELWAY

He's a brilliant man. Brilliant enough 

to catch you.


ZERO

Brilliant? You think he caught any 

of them because he was brilliant? 

Hardboy? MyDick? Imelda? Ripper? 

Think about it, how did he locate 

them?

(Mack has no answer)

He found them as Murman. And how did 

Murder Man find them? With sweet 

talk and brains? No. He did it with 

souvenirs. He took them into private 

rooms, swapped goodies: pictures, 

panties, jewelry, body parts. Snuff 

downloads. As bait. That's why I 

never exchanged with him. He killed 

girls, oh yeah, harvested them. He 

had the best stuff. Richard Low is 

Murman and Murman is one of us.


The realization hits Mack: of course.


CUT TO:


EXT. STATE ROAD NIGHT


Low leans over Kulok's shoulder as she takes Exit 29, drives 

down the dark road. They see something through the windshield:


The Boy stands in the center of the road, JUMPING up and 

down in the rain.


Jaime stops beside the Boy, jumps out, embraces him, unties 

him.


LOW

Where is he? Where is he?


The Boy POINTS to distant access road; red lights glow from 

the back of Zero's truck.


KULOK

(to Boy)

Keep walking toward the highway. 

Wait there.


She jumps behind the wheel, cuts the headlights, drives toward 

the access road.


CUT TO:


EXT. INTERSTATE NIGHT


David Koessler, rain-soaked, manages to flag down a passing 

patrol car.


Holding up his ID, he speaks to the patrolman.


CUT TO:


INT. ZERO'S KILL SPACE NIGHT


Zero, killing blade held high, approaches Mackelway:


ZERO

You want to get into my head, 

Lionheart? Well, come on in!


Zero makes slow slicing motion; Mack tenses.


ZERO

You want to "profile" me? Find out 

what makes me "tick"? Write about 

me, go on a talk show, give me a 

nickname?


MACKELWAY

It's over for you.


ZERO

Take your shirt off.


Mack, playing for time, loosens his tie.


CUT TO:


EXT. TRUCK NIGHT


Kulok pulls near Zero's Peterbuilt, puts the unmarked vehicle 

in park.


Richard Low, sensing she is going to leave him in the car, 

grows increasingly agitated:


LOW

Uncuff me! You can't go alone!


Kulok unholsters her weapon, checks it.


Low, so close to the quarry he has stalked for so long, 

THRASHES like a dog in heat:


LOW

I'll do anything! I'll turn myself 

in! You can't go without me!


Jaime, realizing he will break the windows if necessary to 

get out, improvises a strategy:


KULOK

Okay, I'll unhook you. No weapon.


LOW

No weapon.


KULOK

Turn around. Stretch your arms over 

the seat.


Low, turning, complies. He grimaces, thrusts his manacled 

wrists over the seat.


KULOK

A little more.


Low grunts, pushes his arms. Jaime takes a second pair of 

handcuffs from her belt, CLIPS one cuff to the steering wheel, 

the other to the chain between Low's wrists. He's chained 

back first to the steering wheel. The cuffs snap like an 

echo inside Low's head:


LOW

Bitch! Cunt! Please, please, please 

don't do this, Agent Kulok. You need 

me.


KULOK

I'll be back.


She gets out, slams the door. Low, shackled inside, presses 

his face to the window, watches her, like a caged animal.


CUT TO:


INT. ZERO'S KILL SPACE NIGHT


Mackelway, clammy in the freezing air, now bare-chested. 

Zero presses the tip of his knife into Mack's nipple.


ZERO

Can you feel that? Good, huh? Make 

your move. Make your fucking move, 

Agent Mackelway.


Zero TIPS the blade in. Mack grimaces.


CUT TO:


INT. UNMARKED CAR NIGHT


Richard Low, watching Kulok walk away, cannot abide the 

possibility that he will be a spectator to the event he has 

pursued for so long.


Seeing the mounted shotgun, Low SWINGS his legs around, 

presses the soles of his shoes against the windshield.


In pain, he positions himself so that the chain linking his 

handcuffs together is flat against the opening of the shotgun 

barrel.


Now all he has to do is contort his body, wheel his head 

down, activate the trigger with his tongue and teeth.


He does: the ensuing BLAST rocks the car.


CUT TO:


EXT. TRUCK NIGHT


Kulok, hearing the shotgun blast, wheels around.


CUT TO:


INT. ZERO'S KILL SPACE NIGHT


Zero hears the shotgun blast.


CUT TO:


EXT. TRUCK NIGHT


Kulok is greeted by a horrific sight:


Richard Low tumbles out the passenger door, struggles to his 

feet: his left hand is blown away, his arm a bleeding stump. 

The handcuffs hang from his right hand. The shotgun blast 

has seared his side and arm.


Low uses his bleeding stump to PUMP the shotgun.


Kulok, stunned, FIRES as she raises her automatic.


CUT TO:


ZERO'S KILL SPACE NIGHT


Simultaneous actions: Mack catches the distracted Zero by 

surprise, WHIRLS him around, placing him in a CHOKE HOLD. 

Wresting Zero's knife from his hand, Mack puts the knife to 

Zero's throat.


CUT TO:


TRUCK NIGHT


Low's smile tells Kulok she missed. He fires the pump shotgun --


The BLAST hits her mid-chest, sends her flying backwards, 

hitting the ground with a SPLASH.


CUT TO:


INT. TRUCK NIGHT


Pushing Zero forward betwixt the hung slabs of beef, Mack 

reacts to the shotgun blast. Zero, trying to escape, THROWS 

an elbow.


Mack squeezes Zero's neck tighter, the knife bringing a LINE 

OF BLOOD above his collar bone.


CUT TO:


EXT. TRUCK NIGHT


Kulok, on her back, cranes her neck to view the rear of the 

truck. Blurry figures move in the rain.


CUT TO:


EXT. TRUCK NIGHT


Appearing at the rear of the refrigerated truck, Mack and 

Zero see the same sight:


Richard Low, bleeding profusely, stepping over Kulok's body, 

pointing a shotgun at them with a manacled right hand. Low 

steadies his aim.


MACKELWAY

No!


Low fires: blood BLOSSOMS across Zero's side, knocking both 

him and Mack off the back of the truck. Arms flailing, they 

SPLAT to the ground.


The blast knocks Low backward; he FALLS to the ground.


Zero, bleeding, struggles to his feet, staggers away. Mack 

grabbing Zero's knife, steps to Jaime, checks her pulse: 

she's alive.


Mack, picking up speed, tracks Zero.


Low, watching Zero stagger off, whines like a chained animal. 

He attempts to stand, cannot.


Turning onto his side, he attempts to pump the shotgun.


Running now, Mack pursues Zero. About to be jumped from 

behind, Zero turns, CHOP BLOCKS Mackelway to the ground, 

climbs ATOP of him.


They wrestle in the muddy rocks. Mack, gaining the upper 

hand, grabs Zero's hand and the knife it holds, FORCES IT 

INTO THE SIDE OF HIS FACE. Zero is finally dead.


Mack pulls himself up, retraces his steps.


Reaching Jaime, he lifts her, carries her to shelter under 

Zero's semi. He looks at her: he seems changed by these 

events, changed in a way he cannot yet articulate.


Looking toward her headlights, he sees Richard Low attempting 

to stand.


Mackelway stands, heads toward Low. Kulok's gun lies in the 

mud where she fell; Mack stoops to pick it up.


Low, drenched through with blood and mud, has righted himself 

on his knees. Mack approaches. They exchange looks.


Low slowly RAISES the pumped shotgun, points it at Thomas 

Mackelway.


Mackelway FIRES Kulok's automatic. The bullet HITS Low in 

the chest. He FALLS a final time. Mack walks over.


Low looks up at Mack:


LOW

You know what that's called?

(Mack doesn't answer)

Suicide by cop.


Mack kicks away the shotgun.


LOW

Is he dead?


MACKELWAY

Yeah.


LOW

The boy's okay. I saw him...


Low gestures with his head: come closer. Mack drops to his 

knees, bends closer to Low.


LOW

Was it Zero?


MACKELWAY

Yeah.


Low tries to speak; his voice is barely audible. Mack leans 

his ear closer:


LOW

(guttural)

I have something for you. Just for 

you.


Mack, lifting Low's head, leans his ear to his mouth.


LOW

In my right pocket. 1242 East Storm 

Street, Marshalltown, Iowa. Oh fuck, 

it hurts.


Low, shivering, dies.


Mackelway reaches into Low's right pocket, retrieves house 

keys.


Hearing a distant sound, Mack looks up: a HELICOPTER 

approaches in the distance. Its spotlight rakes the landscape.


Mack, holding Jaime's gun, pocketing Low's keys, runs from 

the scene -- past Zero's truck, past Zero's body, into the 

dark Texas night.


The approaching helicopter finds nothing but bodies.


FADE TO BLACK:


EXT. MARSHALLTOWN DAY


FADE IN: another day, perhaps months hence.


Thomas Mackelway, beard growth on his face, wearing farm 

clothes, steps out of a compact car.


He checks the address, walks up to 1242 East Storm. A normal 

house on a normal street in as normal a town as one could 

imagine.


Mack, looking side to side, uses Low's keys to open the front 

door.


CUT TO:


INT. LOW'S HOUSE DAY


The house is, on the surface, unexceptional. Everything is 

as one would expect.


Mack drifts from room to room until he finds a locked door. 

Using a second key, he opens it.


It leads to a cellar.


CUT TO:


INT. LOW'S COMPUTER ROOM NIGHT


Mack flips on the light, steps down the stairs: Low's secret 

life stands revealed. Mackelway crosses to Low's work station, 

looks at the still active screen monitors.


Continuing on, he comes to the source, the soul, the core of 

Richard Low's depravity: a killing table soaked dark red 

with stains, photos of murder victims -- his own and others. 

He opens a refrigerator: inside are body parts -- ears, eyes, 

noses, breasts. Robert Testa's foot. Each identified by name 

and date.


Mackelway approaches an extended bulletin board. There, under 

the rubric "Suspect Zero," are Missing Persons reports and 

photos of victims, among them Karen Sumpter.


Below this, yet ANOTHER lineup under the words "Suspect Zero 

#2" -- more pictures, more Missing Persons.


And below: "Suspect Zero #3." More photos, more possibilities.


CUT TO:


INT. BUS STATION DAY


America: any town, anywhere.


Tom Mackelway, dressed as a security guard, watches travelers 

come and go, all the while keeping track of one area, the 

area of his attention: a bank of lockers.


A man, a white man, a furtive man, a fucking loser, enters, 

checking a locker number on a piece of paper, looking this 

way and that, all the while inching closer to a particular 

locker.


Mack watches him, waits. Over we hear a metallic voice:


MACKELWAY (O.S.)

[This is Lionheart. Sorry for the 

abrupt departure. Glad to be back. I 

missed you guys.]
