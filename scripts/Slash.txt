"SLASH"


Written by


Stephen Francis & Gus Silber




OVER A BLACK SCREEN:


We hear the tinkling of an old-fashioned MUSIC BOX. It's 

playing the familiar childhood melody of "OLD MACDONALD HAD 

A FARM". A small child's voice sings with the tune.


There's something a little eerie and dissonant about it.


In the background, we hear the sound of FARM ANIMALS... a 

COW mooing, a HORSE neighing, and so on.


FADE IN:


INT. OLD BARN - NIGHT


It's night. Many yesterdays ago. We're not sure exactly when 

but we can tell we're in the past.


A LITTLE BOY, six years old, is sitting next to some bales 

of hay.


An old-fashioned OIL-BURNING LANTERN is next to him, casting 

flickering shadows on the walls.


And now we see where the tune is coming from: The boy staring 

into a rustic, hand-carved music box.


The boy HEARS something.


Turning off the music, he scuttles behind some bales of hay 

to hide.


THE BARN DOOR creaks slowly open.


Someone -- we can't see who -- enters... wearing LARGE BLACK 

BOOTS. He's pushing a big container on wheels.


Something's inside the container -- we can't see what... 

because it's covered by a ratty old TARP. It's pushed 

closer... its wheels SQUEAKING.


HOLD on the BOY.


In his hiding place. Worried. Very worried.


The CONTAINER stops -- right in front of the bales of hay.


Inches from the BOY's face. And then --


BLACK BOOTS throws back the tarp... revealing a tangled, 

intriguing CONTRAPTION of pipes and valves and funnels.


THE BOY


peers through the bales of hay, not sure what the man's doing. 

But whatever it is... it's horrific. Something red and sticky 

gushes through the valves and pipes... going into the funnel, 

sticking into the plastic sac. The boy pulls back in fright --

snapping a piece off the music box... causing it to PLAY 

again. The boy is terrified.


BLACK BOOTS... turns toward the source of the music.


A look of sheer horror in the boy's eyes.


The boy's trembling hands scramble to cover the music box.


To stop it. To quiet it somehow.


BLACK BOOTS


-- advances. Closer, closer -- The boy tries to crawl away --

deserting the music box still playing.


A gloved HAND reaches out, grabbing his ankle.


The boy struggles.


A LANTERN falls, immediately setting fire to the surrounding 

straw.


A horrible scream of rage -- as the black boots catch fire.


The man writhes. Screaming. A human fireball.


The fire spreads everywhere.


The boy, terrified, tries to scramble out through a loose 

plank in the barn wall...


The fire rages on. The screaming continues.


SMASH CUT TO:


BEGIN TITLES


EXT. FARMLAND ROAD - (PRESENT DAY) - NIGHT


TITLE: 16 YEARS LATER


It's dark, deserted, lonely. The harvest moon is shining 

overhead.


And then --


The approaching HEADLIGHTS of a soft-top convertible, whipping 

up dust as it zooms along. Loud ROCK MUSIC blaring from 

within.


INT. CAR - CONTINUOUS


CLOSE ON: A MASK similar to the one used in "SCREAM". It's 

on the face of the DRIVER of the car. He's also wearing a 

BLACK HOOD and CAPE.


He turns to look at the PRETTY YOUNG WOMAN in the passenger 

seat. She's KAREN, about 18, fresh out of high school.


She's wearing a skimpy BIKINI with a leopard-skin pattern, a 

necklace of ANIMAL CLAWS, and not much else.


She rubs her goose-pimply arms --


KAREN

Jeez, close that window, Ray! I'm 

freezing in here. -- And take off 

that stupid mask.


He whips off his mask, and tucks it underneath his cape.


Meet RAY, about 20, athletic, a bit of a prankster. He leers 

at Karen --


RAY

I can't help it, babe. You bring out 

the monster in me.


Ray puts a hand on her exposed thigh. Karen removes it.


KAREN

Not while you're driving.


Karen pops open a beer.


RAY

Throw me one.


KAREN

Not while you're driving.


As Karen chugs her beer, Ray can't help glancing at her 

cleavage.


KAREN

-- And keep your eyes on the road.


RAY

I'm admiring your costume. What 

"movie" are you going as again?


KAREN

Sheena, Queen of the Jungle.


Off Ray's blank stare --


RAY

Never heard of it.


KAREN

I'm not surprised. It's got a body 

count of zero. And no one goes around 

in a stupid mask, hacking innocent 

people to death.


RAY

(re: the mask)

You don't like my costume? Cool. 

I'll go with plan B. Which one you 

like better?


With one hand on the wheel, Ray holds up two other masks --


The white SHAPE face from the "Halloween" series... and a 

HOCKEY MASK from "Friday the 13th".


Karen rolls her eyes.


RAY

Hey... wanna see something really 

scary?


Ray reaches down under the seat, taking his eyes off the 

road. Before he can get any further, KAREN'S eyes widen in 

terror --


KAREN

Watch out!!!


As she GRABS the steering wheel --


EXT. FARMLAND ROAD - NIGHT


A COW, standing dumbly in the middle of the road. The car 

swerves wildly, knocking over a signpost --


EXT. ROAD (CORNFIELD) - CONTINUOUS


-- as it careens off to the side of the road.


WINDSHIELD POV:


Rows and rows of CORN smashing against the glass.


Finally, the car comes to rest in the middle of the FIELD.


Clouds of dust reflected in the headlight beams. The HORN 

blares.


INT./EXT. - CAR


Ray turns to check Karen -- she's unconscious, head back on 

the seat.


RAY

Karen...? Oh, geez! Karen....?


He quickly feels her pulse. Then he puts his hand over her 

heart, trying to find a heartbeat.


He pauses for a moment. He can't help himself -- his hand 

moves slo-o-o-o-wly upwards, towards her breasts.


Suddenly, KAREN's eyes pop open -- and she grabs his hand 

and pushes it away. She's been playing possum.


KAREN

Is that all you ever think of? Suppose 

I was really hurt!


RAY

Dammit, Karen -- I was just... looking 

for your pulse.


KAREN

-- By way of my breasts?


She huffs.


RAY

Sit tight.


EXT. CORNFIELD - MOMENTS LATER


ON THE CAR HOOD


-- being opened by RAY. There's a little steam coming out 

and the engine's hot.


RAY

(burns himself)

Ow!


KAREN

What's wrong?


RAY

Nothing. I'll have us back on the 

road in no time.


RAY looks down and sees the smashed wooden SIGN, stuck in 

the RADIATOR GRILLE. He eases it out --


The sign reads... "No trespassing -- J. Macdonald."


RAY

(realizes)

Hey -- Macdonald's farm!


KAREN

Ray -- I'd like to get to the club 

sometime before dawn.


Karen holds a "flyer" for a music club.


RAY

Be right back. Gotta irrigate the 

corn.


We STAY WITH RAY as he walks deeper into --


EXT. CORN FIELD - CONTINUOUS


Lit by the moon and shafts of the car headlights, it's eerie, 

quiet... scary.


RAY

(singing to himself)

-- Old Macdonald had a farm, e-i-e-

io... and on that farm, he -- almost 

ran over a cow -- e-i, e-i, ohhhhh --


Looking for a place to pee, Ray turns a corner surrounded by 

a wall of corn.


He unzips his fly, and swaying, relieves himself in a wide 

arc.


For the first time, he casually turns to his left to see --


A SCARY FIGURE


silhouetted against the moonlight, standing next to him --


RAY

(startled)

-- Jesus!!!


-- But it's only a harmless SCARECROW, arms outstretched on 

a pole. Ray suddenly looks down, realizes he's pissing on 

himself and his cape.


RAY

Dammit!!!


INT. CAR


KAREN is still sitting in the car, bopping to music on the 

CD player. She preens herself, tucks her breasts into her 

leopard costume, awaiting Ray's return.


EXT. CORN FIELD - NIGHT


RAY appraises the SCARECROW -- tentatively pokes him. It's 

made of straw.


RAY

Fuckin' scarecrow.


He takes a piece of straw, puts it in his mouth. He turns 

around, going back to the car, moving past the corn field.


Suddenly, RAY halts -- something pulls him backwards! We 

HEAR a ripping sound. Ray slowly turns around to see --


HIS CAPE -- caught on a piece of WIRE. He shudders, pulls it 

off.


Ray takes another step forward. -- Did he just hear something 

in the cornfield with him -- or was it his imagination?


INT. CAR


KAREN's a little anxious. Ray should have been back by now.


She leans out the window, trying to look past the open car 

HOOD.


KAREN

(calls out)

How many beers did you have, Ray?!


Beat. No answer.


KAREN

(calls out)

Raymond...?!!


No answer. Karen turns the music off. She peers out the 

window, the open hood obscuring her view.


Still no sign of Ray.


FLAP FLAP FLAP -- several nightjar BIRDS flutter out of the 

cornfield, unsettling her.  KAREN (CONT'D)


KAREN

...Ray??


Still no sign of Ray. Karen's starting to get very worried.


Something's not right. And then --


A FIGURE wearing the cape and Scream Mask POPS UP next to 

her -- scaring the shit out of her. Karen freaks.


KAREN

Geez! -- That wasn't funny!


The MASKED FIGURE with the cape just stands outside the car, 

looking at her.


KAREN

Okay, Ray. I'm freezing. Get in the 

car.


The MASKED FIGURE stands there, unmoving, by her open window. 

Just staring. A feeling of unease washes over Karen. Maybe 

this figure... isn't Ray at all.


KAREN

...Ray...?


And then, the MASKED FIGURE raises his arm -- and we see a 

shiny, long-bladed KNIFE clenched in his fist.


The FIGURE brings the BLADE down, PLUNGING it through the 

open window -- and into Karen's chest!


Karen SCREAMS. She looks down at the blade. And the blood on 

her bare skin. Beat.


KAREN

-- Owwww! That hurt!!!


The Masked Figure "pulls out" the retractable KNIFE blade, 

and takes off his mask. It is indeed... Ray. Always the joker.


He squeezes the knife handle by way of demonstration... a 

little fake "blood" comes out of the blade.


RAY

Fake blood. Cool, huh?


Karen is like, totally unamused. She wipes herself off, 

glaring.


RAY

Oh come on, Karen!


RAY starts stabbing himself in the chest to demonstrate --


RAY

It's a retractable blade! You couldn't 

cut yourself if you wanted to! Look!


-- Suddenly another blade protrudes from Ray's chest. A REAL 

one. A long-handled farm SCYTHE has swung around -- hitting 

him in the back, the cold blade RIPPING through him.


A thin stream of blood drips from his surprised lips.


This definitely ain't a trick.


Karen SCREAMS. And screams some more. In the darkness, we 

can't see who's wielding the scythe. The BLADE is pulled 

out, Ray slumps to the ground, dead.


ON TWO BOOTS


-- the killer's boots. Black farm boots. The blade of the 

SCYTHE dangles down next to them. The boots begin walking 

around to the other side of the car.


IN THE CAR


KAREN freaks, realizing she's next. She quickly LOCKS the 

car doors.


Silence.


The KILLER seems to have vanished. But her WINDOW'S still 

half-open!


Karen reaches out for the electric window button. She pushes 

it. The window closes... closes... closes...


WHOOSH! The blade of the SCYTHE swings in at the last second, 

getting caught between the glass and the frame, inches from 

Karen's face.


As the unseen KILLER pulls out the scythe and the window 

automatically closes -- KAREN sees her chance --


She CLIMBS into the driver's seat, hitting the RADIO --


the MUSIC comes back on, LOUD.


Karen turns the ignition key. The ENGINE turns over 

immediately. She just might escape --


ON THE TIRES


They SPIN in the ditch trying to get traction.


And then -- the FRONT TIRES grab the dirt! Karen's about to 

free the car, when --


WHOOSH! The BLADE of the scythe plunges into the rubber, 

deflating the front tire with a rush of air.


KAREN'S POV - THROUGH THE WINDSHIELD


Obscured by the raised hood, she sees THE SCYTHE being raised 

up -- and coming down -- straight into the engine.


There's some SPARKS -- and a SNAP OF WIRES being severed.


And the engine dies. Ditto the music.


Silence, except for Karen's hyperventilation.


And then -- a final realization comes over Karen. She... 

looks up. Remembering... she's in a convertible --


And the top is made of CANVAS. And then --


-- The SCYTHE... sweeps down in a deadly arc, tearing through 

the TOP of the car, almost slicing her ear off.


A GASH opens on her bare arm.


Karen SCREAMS.


She KICKS open the CAR DOOR -- and stumbles into --


EXT. CORN FIELD - NIGHT


KAREN runs ...for her life.


And runs some more.


And someone -- or something's -- following her.


EXT. EDGE OF CORNFIELD - NIGHT


Out of breath, Karen sees a light up ahead.


AN OLD FARMHOUSE. People. A telephone. Safety.


EXT. FARM HOUSE - NIGHT


She frantically bangs on the door, trying to force it open --


KAREN

(hysterical)

Please! I need... help!


No answer. No one's home.


Hurt and bleeding, Karen turns to her right -- and sees --


An Old BARN. A place to hide.


EXT. BARN - NIGHT


With as much stealth as she can, Karen pushes open the old, 

creaky barn door. She leaves a BLOODY HANDPRINT on the door --


INT. BARN - NIGHT


It's deathly quiet. Moonlight shining on bales of hay, 

glinting on farm implements.


Silence.


Then -- from outside, a cow MOOS --


Then a loud CHUFFING sound. A HORSE.


And then -- a few CHICKENS begin to CLUCK.


KAREN

Shhh... SHHHH --


The animals seems to be jittery, nervous.


The HORSE whinnies loudly. The COW moos again.


KAREN puts her hands to her ears, trying to block out the 

unholy chorus --


She backs away --


A FIGURE is behind her.


She backs into it and swings around to see --


A SCARECROW. Burlap skin, jagged, stitched mouth. Cold eyes. 

Cold, and... alive.


SCARECROW'S POV: looking through the burlap at Karen.


The SCARECROW raises a gleaming SCYTHE high in the air.


It swings down --


Karen screams. For the very last time.


CUT TO:


A GUY SCREAMING


-- into a microphone. We PULL BACK, revealing we're at a --


INT. MUSIC CLUB - NIGHT


The kind of smoky dive. Some of the audience members are 

wearing Halloween masks and/or costumes.


On stage, several beats away from the big time, a hungry, 

hard-working rock band.


Ladies and gentlemen, meet Dead Quiet: On guitar and lead 

vocals... JOSEPH "MAC" MACDONALD, 24. Charismatic, driven. 

With a dark side. The leader.


On bass guitar... SUZIE, 24. Hot, punky. A sex-bomb, primed 

to detonate at any moment...


On keyboards... KEITH, 25. Black, street-wise. Attitude.


On drums & percussion... IAN, 30. Party animal.


At the moment, Mac is singing his heart out, sharing the 

mike with SUZIE, drawing on her sexual energy.


Meanwhile, Keith keeps glancing over at the side of the STAGE, 

as if waiting for someone to appear. Looks as if there's a 

band member missing.


Keith shouts over to Mac.


KEITH

Where is he?


Mac steps back and shouts over the music to CARL (20), the 

band's all-round gopher and roadie --


MAC

Carl! Where's Rod?


Carl doesn't hear. He's too busy gazing at the flip-screen 

monitor of a small HAND-HELD DIGITAL VIDEO CAMERA. He's close 

up on Suzie.


Mac, shouting, his voice just about drowned out by the music --


MAC (CONT'D)

Carl!


Carl snaps to attention. Sees the empty mike stand.


As the band continues playing, we FOLLOW CARL, still armed 

with his CAMCORDER, into --


INT. BACKSTAGE HALLWAY


Carl stops in front of a closed DOOR. He knocks tentatively.


CARL

Uh... Hello?


VOICE FROM INSIDE

Fuck off!


CARL instantly recognizes the voice. He hesitates, and then 

knocks again --


CARL

Rod? You're missing your cue!


MAN'S VOICE

No man! I'm right on it!


INT. BACKSTAGE ROOM


CLOSE ON ROD RYDER, 26, the band's cocksure, devil-may-care 

lead guitarist. Talented. And doesn't care who knows it.


At the moment, he's slouching in a chair with his shirt 

unbuttoned. CANDY, a foxy babe with a passion for new age 

philosophy and musicians -- is sitting on his lap, her tongue 

down his throat.


BACK TO:


INT. BACKSTAGE HALLWAY


CARL can hear MOANING coming from inside. He grins.


Stealthily, he stands on tiptoe and reaches out as high he 

can, aiming the camcorder through the clear pane of GLASS at 

the top of the door.


He looks up at the angled flip-screen, hoping to catch a 

glimpse of the action. But all he sees is a flashing "BATTERY" 

icon on the screen. Then nothing. Damn!


CARL

Rod!


CANDY

He's coming!


CARL sighs, pointing the rapidly-dying camcorder at himself --


CARL

Note to self: remember to recharge 

battery.


INT. MUSIC CLUB - NIGHT


The BAND continues to play, doing the best they can. An 

unimpressed audience member hurls a BEER-BOTTLE at the stage.


It just misses Keith's head. Keith is furious, ready to 

explode. He gets up from his seat, fists clenched around his 

drumsticks. Mac gives him a look -- "stay cool." He backs 

down.


BACK TO:


INT. BACKSTAGE ROOM - NIGHT


ROD and CANDY have finished. Candy has progressed from half 

undressed, to half-dressed. Rod's in no real hurry to get on 

stage. He checks his hair in the mirror, and deftly buttons 

up his shirt. Then he looks around --


ROD

Where's my axe?


Candy straps his Fender Stratocaster guitar around his neck.


She gazes adoringly at him --


CANDY

Kill 'em, baby.


ROD

They're as good as dead.


INT. MUSIC CLUB - MOMENTS LATER


As Mac and the band head for the SONG'S crescendo, ROD walks 

a tad unsteadily on stage. Perfect timing. He announces his 

presence with a blistering guitar break.


The AUDIENCE perk up a little. Some cheers, some whistles.


The band members glare at Rod.


INT. DRESSING ROOM - LATER


It's after the set. The door bursts open -- the band are 

tired and sweaty.


KEITH

Motherfucking soundman! I couldn't 

hear myself sing!


IAN

(teasing)

I could. You sucked.


KEITH

Hey. Fuck you.


IAN

Where's Jack? Anybody seen Jack?


CARL is there too, eye glued to his CAMCORDER, panning across 

the band-members. Suzie whips off her sweaty top. Carl's 

eyes widen as he zooms in on her naked breasts.


She catches sight of CARL, and hurls her top at him --


SUZIE

Pervert!


Carl ducks. Suzie puts on a fresh top --


SUZIE

Jesus. What a bunch of useless 

zombies.


KEITH

Who? Us?!


SUZIE

(grinning)

The audience!


IAN

(distracted)

Jack! There you are, buddy!


We see IAN grabbing a half-full bottle of liquor from a mess 

of items on a table. JACK DANIELS. He swigs. Keith holds out 

his hand for some.


KEITH

(enthusiastic)

My man!


Ian finishes the whiskey, hands the empty bottle to Keith.


KEITH

(dryly)

My man.


ROD strides in.


CANDY, his groupie, is hanging onto his arm. Suzie glares at 

him.


ROD

Hey, guys. Good gig.


SUZIE walks over to Rod face to face --


SUZIE

Yeah. Great work, Rod. But next time, 

it would be nice... if you could 

JOIN US FOR THE ENTIRE SET!


ROD

I was getting 'warmed' up.


Rod smiles slyly at Candy. SUZIE'S had enough.


SUZIE

Who do you think we are, dude? Your 

back up band??!!


CANDY jumps in, defiantly to Suzie --


CANDY

Get off his case sweetie.


SUZIE

(to Candy)

Where'd you come from? Groupies R 

Us?


CANDY

Fuck you.


SUZIE

Fuck me? Fuck YOU!!


Rod grins, enjoying the attention, when --


SKREEEEEEEEECH!!! -- The sound of GUITAR FEEDBACK, like nails 

on a blackboard.


MAC, electric GUITAR in hand. The guitar is plugged into a 

small but powerful practice amp. He's certainly got their 

attention.


MAC

Time for a little... "feedback" guys. 

That guy from Hectic Records --


SUZIE

Yeah?


MAC

-- picked tonight to come by and 

watch our set.


KEITH

Shit!


MAC

Relax. He liked what he saw. Well, 

some of it. Enough to give us a 

showcase audition. One week from 

today.


KEITH

Yes!


MAC

Which means we've got ONE week to 

start acting like a professional 

band.


ROD

Hey. Anyone here need lessons, just 

talk to me.


SUZIE

Yeah, I'll teach you a lesson --


Suzie grabs Rod by the shirt and crotch and shoves him against 

the wall.


CANDY tries to grab SUZIE by the hair. SUZIE holds her away 

at arms length, whilst pinning ROD to the wall. It's an action 

Lara Croft would be proud of. SUZIE'S not a girl to mess 

with. Rod's enjoying this.


CARL begins shooting away on his camcorder. Mac tries to 

stop the ruckus.


MAC

OK. OK!


CANDY is furious at ROD'S laid back attitude.


CANDY

Bitch.


ROD

It's OK baby.


And then -- they all become aware of a new presence.


A STRANGER is standing in the doorway. Unshaven, dressed in 

farm clothes and black boots. Out of place in the city.


KEITH

(aside; to Mac)

...That's not... the record guy, is 

it?


Mac shakes his head "no", not taking his eyes off the 

stranger. Then --


STRANGER

Joseph Macdonald?


Mac looks him in the eye --


STRANGER

Your aunt Edith's dead.


Beat. A slight reaction from Mac. The stranger fumbles in 

his pocket, pulling out a letter. He offers it to Mac.


STRANGER

It's from your father.


Mac hesitates. Then he takes the letter, glances at it... 

then crumples it. The Stranger smiles Slightly, almost as if 

he expected it. And then --


STRANGER

He also asked me... to give you this.


The Stranger puts something else in Mac's hand. It's a small 

HAND-CARVED WOODEN FIGURE of a Scarecrow... damaged at the 

base. Old... worn. Mac seems entranced by it.


STRANGER

Funeral's tomorrow afternoon. At the 

farm.


As the Stranger smiles slightly, exits just as quickly as he 

appeared.


Beat.


KEITH

Farm? ...What farm?


CUT TO:


EXT. COUNTRY ROAD - DAY


An old, beat-up SCHOOL BUS, with the name "Dead Quiet" 

emblazoned across it, traveling down a dusty road. Equipment 

and luggage fastened on top. Pinioned to the back of the 

bus, a rough-and-ready-looking OFF-ROAD MOTORBIKE.


INT. BUS - CONTINUOUS


CARL is driving, looking a little lost as he veers his way 

over the rough and tumble country road. He holds the letter 

with directions to the farm Mac ripped up, now taped together.


Mac is sitting alone. Pensive. He holds the small wooden 

figure.


ROD & CANDY, who's come along for the ride -- sit next to 

Keith and Ian. Candy has her eyes closed, meditating.


They're playing some kind of "on the road" game --


KEITH

Okay. My main man. Marvin Gaye.


IAN

Easy. Gunshot. Patricide. Next.


ROD

Curt Cobain.


IAN

Shotgun. Suicide. Next?


KEITH

Wait a second. Did you say 

"patricide?"


IAN

Yeah. Marvin's old man gunned him 

down.


KEITH

That's not patricide. Patricide is 

when you gun down your old man.


IAN

All right. "Fratricide". Minor 

technical detail.


KEITH

Wrong. Fratricide is when you gun 

down your brother. You're out. My 

turn.


IAN

Fine. Be that way. Jim Morrison.


KEITH

Died in the bathtub... if, in fact, 

he's really dead. Next.


ROD

Mama Cass.


CANDY

Who's Mama Cass?


They all stare at her.


ROD

One of the Mamas from the Mamas and 

the Papas.


Candy looks blank.


KEITH

Asphyxiation. Choked to death on a 

ham sandwich. Next.


ROD

(triumphant; makes 

quiz show buzzer 

sound)

Buzzzzzzzzzz. Sorry, wrong answer!


KEITH

Chicken sandwich?


ROD

(loudly)

Bzzzzzzzzzt!


KEITH

Fuck you! Who cares what sandwich 

the bitch was eating?


Suzie looks at Mac, sitting a few rows behind them. She turns 

to the others --


SUZIE

Hey. Could you be a little more 

insensitive? We're on our way to a 

funeral for Crissake.


KEITH

Yeah. Our own. I don't see why we 

got to go along for the ride.


IAN

Come on, dude. A day on a farm isn't 

going to kill you.


MAC

...Heart attack.


Everyone looks at him.


MAC

Mama Cass died of a heart attack. 

The ham sandwich is just an urban 

legend.


CANDY

(to Rod)

Who's the Mamas and the Papas?


EXT. FARM LAND ROAD - DAY


The BUS cruises along, getting deeper into farmland territory.


INT. BUS - DAY


Suzie sits down next to Mac.


SUZIE

You never told us you grew up on a 

farm.


MAC

Nothing to tell.


Suzie stares at him, not giving up.


MAC

My parents separated when I was just 

a kid. I chose my mother. My father 

chose the farm. Haven't been back 

since. I've maybe talked to him twice 

in twelve years.


Off Suzie's look --


MAC

My father and I don't exactly see 

eye to eye.


SUZIE

About what?


MAC

Name something.


SUZIE

Then why go back now?


MAC

Still trying to figure it out myself.


Beat. Mac glances down at the wooden figure in his hand.


ON IAN AND KEITH


Ian accidentally steps on Keith's sneakers.


IAN

New "shoes," Keith?


Keith proudly lifts up his feet, revealing a brand new pair 

of --


KEITH

Nike specials. Two hundred bucks.


IAN

Two hundred bucks?? Are you crazy?


Keith meticulously begins wiping them off with newspaper --


KEITH

Hey. Never criticize a man 'till 

you've walked a mile in his shoes. 

Then you can criticize... 'cause 

you'll be a mile away... and you'll 

have his shoes.


They laugh --


KEITH

Speaking of which -- yo, CARL! Are 

we THERE yet?!


CARL

(driving; to himself)

Like I know. Hey, Mac! Any of this 

look familiar??


MAC

Try taking a left after the next cow 

pasture.


KEITH

(mutters, to Ian)

Yeah. That sounds good. "Hang a left 

at the first cow patty, then make a 

right when you see porky pig".


Mac grins slightly, looks out the window, to see --


EXT. SIDE OF THE ROAD


An OLD WOMAN, standing at a rundown STALL, outside a modest 

FARM HOUSE. Some corn dolls, pumpkins, and dry husks of maize 

are hanging up on display.


Next to her stands a short farmhand, her brother.


MAC catches her gaze.


There's something intense and very unsettling about the way 

her eyes lock on to his.


CUT TO:


EXT. FARM LAND - LATER


WIDE on a large FIELD as the bus passes by.


A BURNING stack of diseased crops. Smoke and flames crackling, 

rising to the sky.


The bus continues, past --


A long shot of a SCARECROW, distant and alone in a field.


And then -- the BUS rises over a small hill... revealing an 

old wooden sign we've seen before -- "No Trespassing - J. 

Macdonald".


INT. BUS


ON MAC.


...He's finally come "home".


EXT. FARM PROPERTY - DAY


Getting closer, the BUS passes a scraggly menagerie of 

FARMYARD ANIMALS. Cows, horses, goats, chickens.


Finally, it pulls up to a cluster of SHEDS and COOPS and 

farm BUILDINGS. Mac's eye finally settles on -- THE OLD BARN


There's something strangely compelling about it... something 

that seems to strike a chord deep inside his memory.


This is MACDONALD'S FARM. Maybe this was a prosperous farm 

once. But once was a long time ago.


The BUS pulls up and stops in the yard between the farmhouse 

and barn. The DOORS whoosh open --


INT. BUS


KEITH and IAN exchange a somewhat nervous glance as they 

gaze out the window.


As the band get their things, moving to get off the bus, 

KEITH pulls down a duffle bag and draws out a pearl handed 

38. SPECIAL. Suzie notices the gun.


SUZIE

You know what they say about men who 

need big guns...


KEITH

Hey. Some Klu Klux Klan homeboy gets 

in my face, he gonna have a few extra 

holes in his bedsheet.


SUZIE

(teasing)

Down boy.


KEITH

Who you callin' "boy?"


Smirking, Keith moves down the aisle. As Suzie and Candy 

wait to exit the bus, they shoot daggers at each other.


CANDY

(low)

Bitch.


SUZIE

(low)

Slut.


CANDY

Witch.


SUZIE

Tramp.


Rod grins, enjoying himself.


ROD

After you... ladies.


EXT. BUS - DAY


The band members file out of the bus. They glance around the 

dilapidated farm.


Candy suddenly seems concerned --


CANDY

Rod. Check out my chakras.


Rod, puzzled, stares at her body.


Candy fingers the crystals around her neck.


CANDY

They've gone darker. Bad vibes.


Suzie, nearby rolls her eyes.


CARL

...shoots the area with his CAMCORDER.


CARL

Note to self: Farming not a career 

option.


Beat. Carl sneezes. The others look at him.


CARL

...Hay fever.


IAN

Man, you came to the wronnng place.


MAC

Be right back. Try to stay out of 

trouble.


Mac moves off -- as Keith looks around.


KEITH

Yeah. Maybe I can pick a little cotton 

for da masta.


SUZIE

You got something against farm people, 

Keith?


KEITH

Not at all. They lynched my ancestors, 

they smell like manure, they have 

sex with their relatives... and they 

all have two first names: "Bobby-

Joe" --


IAN

(joining in, smiling)

"Peggy-Sue" --


KEITH

-- "Billy-Jean" --


Mac walks up to the barn. He seems strangely hesitant.


Slowly, he reaches out his hand. Then he freezes --


As he notices a BLOODY HANDPRINT on the door.


We recognize it as the handprint of the girl who was murdered 

last night.


Just then, the BARN DOOR creaks open, revealing...


THE STRANGER that everyone recognizes as the one who delivered 

the note backstage. Only now he's wearing a blood stained 

apron, black farm boots and in his left hand... a KNIFE... 

dripping with blood.


The Stranger holds up the knife -- grins --


STRANGER

Takes 'em a full thirty seconds to 

realize they ain't got a head.


Everyone stares --


BILLY BOB

Chickens! Glad you could make it. --

Name's Billy Bob.


Keith gives an "I told you so" look.


Mac shakes hands -- then looks at his palm. There's CHICKEN 

BLOOD all over his hand. Billy Bob grins. He wipes the excess 

blood on his apron.


BILLY BOB

Your pa's waiting for you up at the 

house.


MAC

How'd he know I'd come?


Billy Bob just grins enigmatically.


As Mac heads toward the FARM HOUSE --


BILLY BOB

Sorry 'bout your aunt.


Billy Bob picks a chicken up by its feet, getting the knife 

ready, about to go back into the barn --


KEITH

Great.


Billy Bob hears and turns to him.


BILLY BOB

I'd watch your step if I were you, 

son.


KEITH

Oh yeah? Why's that?


BILLY BOB

You're standing in horseshit.


Keith looks down. Yep -- he's standing in horseshit, alright.


KEITH

Damn! These are one hundred dollar 

Nikes!


IAN

I thought you said two hundred.


Billy Bob grins. Spits a globule of black tobacco right next 

to Keith's shoes.


EXT. FARM HOUSE (FRONT ENTRANCE) - MOMENTS LATER


MAC stops, eyeing the house. It sighs and creaks with a life 

of its own. As he opens the screen door to go inside --


INT. LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS


Mac glances around. Shades pulled down, dark and musty 

furniture. Stuffed animal heads on the walls. A spiderweb in 

the corner.


EXT. FARM - SAME TIME


Rod is picking at his guitar as Candy looks on admiringly.


SUZIE is unpacking some bags off the bus rack, unaware that 

CARL is shooting her ass with his CAMCORDER.


IAN snaps off his cellphone, pissed.


IAN

Perfect. No signal.


IAN peers over Carl's shoulder, sees Suzie's ass on the 

screen.


IAN

That got a zoom lens?


CARL

Brace yourself.


As he "zooms" in on Suzie's buns --


SUZIE

Will you guys quit jerking off and 

give me a hand here!


As they grin and help her unload the bus, Ian unloads a box 

full of Jack Daniels bottles --


IAN

Hiya Jack.


INT. FARM LIVING ROOM - SAME TIME


Mac is wandering around the room, uneasy.


Suddenly, he hears a flapping noise. It seems to be coming 

from behind a closed door.


MAC

...Jeremiah?


Mac pushes open the door to --


INT. A DIMLY-LIT SPARE ROOM - CONTINUOUS


CLOSE ON MAC


As he walks into the dark, smaller room, he looks to his 

right to see --


A SHUTTER... flapping slightly from the wind. That's all.


Mac sighs. He turns to his left -- and --


MAC

Daaa!


He almost falls over his AUNT. Dead, laid out "in state" on 

a long, OAK TABLE, candles all around her.


VOICE (O.S.)

Hold it right there. Turn around 

slowly.


MAC slowly turns to see --


-- his father, JEREMIAH MACDONALD, late sixties, weathered 

but strong, a man who's spent his life working hard on a 

farm. He's wearing work clothes -- overalls, and yes, black 

farm boots. With a crazed look in his eye, he's pointing a 

shotgun straight at Mac.


MAC

What are you going to do? Shoot me?


JEREMIAH

Depends. You got some nerve intruding 

on a man's grief. I bet I could pull 

this trigger right now and call it 

justifiable homicide. Now: who are 

you?


MAC

You know who I am. You invited me.


CLICK CLACK! Jeremiah pumps the shotgun, chambering a round. 

Mac's unsettled. Perhaps Jeremiah's gone over the deep end --


MAC

I'm your son. And Laureen's son.


JEREMIAH

Ain't nobody mentioned that name on 

this farm for 14 years. My boy was 

taken from me... far as I'm concerned, 

he's dead. Now, I ain't gonna ask 

you again. -- Who are you?!


MAC

Joseph Macdonald... Your son.


JEREMIAH

Joseph Macdonald. Damn right, boy. 

And don't you forget it.


Jeremiah lowers the shotgun, grins --


JEREMIAH

I'm just yankin' your chain!


It seems Jeremiah has an offbeat sense of humor.


JEREMIAH

Come here... I ain't gonna bite.


MAC approaches cautiously. Jeremiah grabs Mac, hugging him --


Mac's pretty awkward, but he puts up with this.


JEREMIAH

Look at you! You're a dead ringer 

for your grandpa, God rest his soul. 

If he could only see you now.


Mac looks at Edith. A wave of remorse washes over him.


MAC

I came back for the funeral. That's 

all.


JEREMIAH

Broke her heart you never visited... 

But I always said you'd come back.


Jeremiah reaches down, tenderly strokes his sister's hair.


MAC

I'll be gone again tomorrow.


JEREMIAH

...Guess it was her time to go. You 

can't argue... when the good Lord 

calls you home.


There's an awkward beat --


MAC

How... was she "called?"


JEREMIAH

Pardon?


MAC

Aunt Edith. How did she... die?


Jeremiah puts a PIPE in his mouth, lights it.


JEREMIAH

"Natural causes."


CUT TO:


EXT. MACDONALD GRAVEYARD - AFTERNOON


We're in a small family graveyard on a HILL by the farmhouse, 

where Macdonalds have been buried for centuries.


A PREACHER stands nearby, conducting the service for Edith. 

He stands between Billy Bob and Jeremiah.


Two three LOCALS from the village have also come to pay their 

respects. A few feet away are the rest of the band, standing 

awkwardly.


They'd rather be somewhere else.


Mac stands beside Suzie. She gently squeezes his hand.


ON THE PREACHER


PREACHER

...and we ask you to bestow your 

blessing on this worthless band of 

sinners. And so... ashes to ashes... 

dust to dust...


KEITH

(making a rhyme sotto 

voce)

-- Let's hurry up and get back on 

the bus.


PREACHER

We are here to honor the memory of 

Edith Macdonald... and deliver her 

to her eternal rest.


ON JEREMIAH. Head bowed, reverent, dressed in a sombre black 

suit.


MAC watches him.


CARL surreptitiously opens the flip-screen of his camcorder 

to shoot the funeral.


KEITH

(quietly, to Ian)

Shit, when I die, hope there's a 

bigger turn-out.


PREACHER

To everything there is a season, a 

time to be born -- a time to die. A 

time to kill... and a time to heal...


As the Preacher talks, Mac suddenly sees --


-- a WOMAN, dressed in black, with a veil over her face.


Odd. He didn't notice her before.


The Woman moves closer to Mac... closer... she removes the 

veil. A mixture of terror and fury --


PREACHER

-- a time to keep silent, and a time 

to speak --


The woman looks Mac directly in the eye.


WOMAN

The devil has returned.


Mac recognizes the Old Woman (JESSE) from the lonely farm 

stall on the side of the road.


MAC

I... pardon...?


JESSE

You look just like him. Like Jethro.


JEREMIAH

(hard; to the woman)

You're not welcome here, Jesse.


JESSE

I came to pay my respects.

(beat)

And to warn you.


JEREMIAH

I want you off my land. -- Keep 

reading, Reverend.


PREACHER

(clears his throat; 

trying to continue)

Er... a time to love... a time to... 

hate --


OLD WOMAN

(to Jeremiah)

It's started again, hasn't it? The 

harvest of blood. I know. I can feel 

it. Your father's legacy of evil --


JEREMIAH

-- My daddy's dead. You and the others 

saw to that.


OLD WOMAN

Yes. And burning in hell! And you're 

going to join him -- wait and see!


PREACHER

Uh, a time to embrace... and a time 

to refrain from embracing...


JEREMIAH

Get out of here. Or so help me --


Something snaps in Jeremiah's head. He picks up a shovel, 

raising it as a weapon --


PREACHER

A time to -- holy shit!! Jeremiah -- 

NO!!


Mac grabs Jeremiah, struggling to keep the shovel away from 

Jesse's head. Candy screams.


CARL seizes the moment, taping the action with his camcorder.


JESSE stands her ground. Looks coldly at Mac.


JESSE

(to Mac)

The sins of the fathers shall be 

visited upon their children's 

children. And the sword shall be 

made drunk with their blood.


She spits on the ground, walking away.


Mac releases his hold on Jeremiah.


KEITH

(low)

Damn. White folks usually chill at 

funerals.


PREACHER

(quickly)

Uh, I commit Edith Macdonald to the 

blessed soil of the land she knew 

and cherished. Amen.


OTHERS

Amen.


The PREACHER nods to Billy Bob, who gently takes the shovel 

from Mac. He spits on his palms, rubs them together.


As the first pile of dirt hits the coffin --


EXT. FARM (NEAR THE GRAVESIDE) - LATER


The funeral's over. As the others walk down the hill, Jeremiah 

is shaking hands with the PREACHER --


JEREMIAH

Sorry about the shovel, Eugene. Guess 

I got a little carried away.


PREACHER

The lord forgives your sins Jeremiah. 

Can't say the same about the law.


As he says this, the Preacher gets in his car -- which we 

now see is a SHERIFF'S SQUAD CAR. He yanks off his clerical 

collar, as if it's been strangling him, puts down his bible.


He reaches on the seat and just as swiftly puts a SHERIFF'S 

HAT on his head. He eyes the other band members.


PREACHER

Keep an eye on your guests. We don't 

want no pot smoking musicians spoiling 

things around here.


JEREMIAH

Don't worry. S'all under control. 

Workin' on any big cases?


PREACHER

Nah. Things are dead quiet.


As the sheriff's car pulls out, Jeremiah watches -- his eyes 

are now on the BARN some distance away.


MAC's there, pushing open the barn door. Jeremiah smiles 

slightly.


INT. BARN - AFTERNOON


The BARN DOOR CREAKS open.


Exploring, MAC enters the barn by himself. It's a big, run 

down structure that has seen better harvests.


Hanging up is an impressive array of scythes, axes, hoes, 

and sickles. Simple, functional FARM IMPLEMENTS -- but the 

light gives their blades a sudden edge of menace.


The afternoon sunlight filters through the wooden slats, 

hitting a pile of straw, dust rising up from it.


Then... MAC notices something --


SOMEBODY'S LEGS.


-- clad in dirty jeans, old shoes... stretched out and partly 

hidden behind a barn STALL. Someone's sitting there, quietly 

biding their time.


MAC moves closer.


And closer. Until he sees --


A raggedy old SCARECROW, propped up against the stall.


Harmless.


Mac bends over to check it out... unaware that there's 

somebody else in the barn with him.


A SCYTHE


-- hanging on the wall is removed from its place.


MAC

-- is still looking at the old 

scarecrow, when --


WHOOSH! -- The deadly blade comes sweeping down, slicing the 

air near him. Mac spins around to see --


IAN, scythe in hand, stoned, doing "Kung Fu" moves.


IAN

Hey dude -- don't fear the reaper!


Beat. Mac stares, the color drained from his face.


IAN

So. When's dinner?


EXT. CORNFIELD - MAGIC HOUR


The Scarecrow, hanging alone in the field. The sun is sinking.


INT. BATHROOM - NIGHT


CANDY's going to take a shower. She looks around the bathroom. 

Something creepy about it. She takes off her robe, turns on 

the shower. Gets under the water.


It feels good.


ON THE DOORKNOB


It starts to turn. Slowly at first. Then the knob TWISTS 

back and forth, violently.


CUT TO:


INT. HALL WAY - SAME TIME


It's Suzie twisting the knob. It's locked. Suzie wears nothing 

but a towel, impatient to shower. She bangs on the door.


SUZIE

Hey! Don't use all the hot water!


INT. BATHROOM


CANDY

Keep your shirt on! I'm almost done!


INT. HALL WAY


SUZIE

(under her breath)

Bitch.


INT. BATHROOM


CANDY

Bitch.


INT. HALL WAY


Suddenly, from behind Suzie, two HANDS grab her. Suzie spins 

around.


It's MAC. He moves in closer, holding her --


MAC

Ten thirty. My room. Clothing 

optional.


Suzie smiles meaningfully.


SUZIE

What about Jeremiah?


MAC

Nah. Just you.


As they kiss --


Suddenly, we hear a terrible SCREAM from inside the bathroom 

and --


Mac twists the door handle, still locked and -- it's an old 

door, so he easily forces it open and they rush in to the 

bathroom, and --


INT. BATHROOM - CONTINUOUS


-- Mac throws aside the shower curtain, and --


-- Candy's standing there, naked, terrified. Shaking, she 

points --


CANDY

Look.


There's a medium-sized SPIDER high up on the wall.


Mac and Suzie stand there, incredulous.


Rod, Ian and Carl rush into the bathroom --


ROD

What is it?!!


SUZIE

(pissed)

Spider.


Beat. As all the men stare --


CARL

(enjoying the view)

I'll get it.


INT. DINING ROOM - NIGHT


ON A PLATE OF WHOLE COOKED CHICKENS and MEAT... the result 

of Billy Bob's handiwork.


JEREMIAH and Billy Bob are eating heartily without a care in 

the world.


Mac and the others watch them.


There's a bottle of MOONSHINE. Ian takes a SIP --


-- and chokes --


JEREMIAH

Best corn liquor in the county. Make 

it myself. Edith used to say: the 

two hardest things to swallow... are 

pride and moonshine.


CANDY

I can think of a third.


Carl and Billy Bob chuckle.


IAN

(takes another sip)

How'd... you... make it, exactly?


Jeremiah leans closer, looks Ian straight in the eye --


JEREMIAH

Well, I could tell you... but then, 

I'd have to cut your throat and gut 

you like a pig.


Silence.


Jeremiah laughs. The others look at each other, smiling 

tentatively --


JEREMIAH

Just yanking your chain! Old family 

secret.


He looks across at Mac --


JEREMIAH

Some things are better left that 

way. Right, son?


Mac ignores this. There's an awkward silence.


SUZIE

Uh... thanks for dinner. It was 

delicious.


Suzie's anxious to leave the table, meet up with Mac.


Jeremiah looks wistful.


JEREMIAH

Chicken. Used to be Edith's favorite.


Beat. Jeremiah chokes up, suddenly remorseful.


BILLY BOB

(raises his glass)

To... Edith. May she rest in peace.


JEREMIAH

To... Edith.


Everyone... drinks. Suzie wants to leave.


SUZIE

Okay. Well --


Jeremiah raises his glass again --


JEREMIAH

-- and... to my... son.


Everyone settles back in again --


JEREMIAH

...The last of the Macdonalds. Who's 

finally been called back home.


Jeremiah and Mac lock eyes.


JEREMIAH

Even if it is... for one day.


Everyone drinks. But it's not over yet.


JEREMIAH

And to...


CANDY

The farm?


Suzie rolls her eyes, glares at Candy. Candy smirks.


JEREMIAH

(raises his glass)

Good idea, little lady. "The farm."


IAN

To "Old Macdonald's farm" --


KEITH

"E-I, E-I, Oh --"


CRASH!!


The GLASS suddenly SHATTERS in Jeremiah's hand.


Rivulets of blood on his fingers. At first, he doesn't notice.


SUZIE

Your hand is bleeding.


JEREMIAH

...Excuse me.


Jeremiah gets up, holding his hand, goes into the kitchen.


KEITH

Damn. Whassup with that?


No one speaks at first.


BILLY BOB

You just reminded him... of Jethro.


SUZIE

Who's Jethro?


No one answers.


SUZIE

Who's Jethro?


BILLY BOB

Jethro Macdonald.


MAC

...My grandfather.


Everyone turns toward Mac. When he doesn't continue --


BILLY BOB

'Scared most people in this county 

half to death. The kids used to call 

him... "Crazy Old Macdonald". They'd 

sing that old nursery rhyme...


CANDY

(glancing uneasily 

over her shoulder)

He's not... still around... is he?


BILLY BOB

Died about fourteen years ago in a 

fire. Knocked over a kerosene lamp 

in the barn. Burnt to death...


SUZIE

Jesus.


IAN

What was it about him that... scared 

people?


BILLY BOB

Why don't you ask Mac? -- It's his 

granddaddy.


All eyes on MAC.


MAC

I don't remember...


A beat --


ROD

(flippant)

What was he... some kind of axe 

murderer?


JEREMIAH (O.S.)

Why don't you ask him yourself?


Beat. Jeremiah's walked back into the room, his hand bandaged.


JEREMIAH

He's sitting right behind you. -- On 

the mantle.


Everyone turns around.


A decorative cremation URN is indeed sitting on the mantle.


Jeremiah picks it up. He holds the urn tenderly in his hands --


JEREMIAH

My daddy was a man of vision. People 

always fear what they don't 

understand.


Jeremiah looks down at the urn. He's silent for a moment --


JEREMIAH

He lived for this land. And he died 

for it. Rest in peace, daddy.


Slowly, Jeremiah lifts the lid off the urn. No one wants to 

Look inside. Finally, Carl leans over, and --


SNEEZES... scattering ashes!


CARL

Sorry.


An awkward beat. Then


Jeremiah laughs, slaps Carl on the back --


JEREMIAH

I'm just yankin' your chain! It's an 

ashtray. -- Jethro's buried right 

there across the field with the rest 

of the family... Cigar?


Jeremiah pulls out a handful of cigars offering them to 

everyone, as we --


EXT. FARMHOUSE - NIGHT


Things are... well, dead quiet. Except for an electric BUG 

ZAPPER. Purple, glowing. We hear a "ZAP" as several bugs 

meet their maker. We can hear CRICKETS in the darkness.


INT. LIVING ROOM - NIGHT - LATER


Keith, sitting on the COUCH, wearing only his underwear, 

removing his expensive Nikes.


Then he lies down, covers himself with a thin farm blanket, 

and tries to get comfortable --


KEITH

(muttering to himself)

Yeah. Sure. Put the black man on the 

couch...


INT. MAC'S BEDROOM - NIGHT


It used to be his grandfather's room. There are old family 

photos on the wall. Creepy.


Mac stares out the window. Outside, we can see the old BARN 

in the moonlight.


Is that Billy Bob going inside?


The bedroom door opens. It's Jeremiah. Mac turns away, looking 

back out at the barn.


JEREMIAH

That old barn. After the fire... I 

rebuilt it nail by nail. Just the 

way your granddaddy would've wanted 

it.


MAC

(not happy)

This is his room... isn't it?


JEREMIAH

Was. You ain't afraid of ghosts, now 

are you?


MAC

I'll be fine here.


Jeremiah holds out a bound stack of envelopes.


JEREMIAH

Thought you might want these.


Mac just stares at them.


JEREMIAH

Just so you know. After your mother 

took you away, I wrote you. She 

returned every one of 'em.


Mac makes no move to take them. Instead, Jeremiah places 

them on the table.


JEREMIAH

Well. Then... I'll leave you to it.


Jeremiah's about to exit --


JEREMIAH

You got it wrong, boy. I'm not the 

monster you think.


MAC

Maybe you should tell that to the 

old lady you tried to hit with the 

shovel.


JEREMIAH

I wouldn't pay Jesse no mind at all. 

She's just a crazy old woman. Hasn't 

been right in the head since her 

husband passed away.

(beat)

Wasn't much right before that, 

neither.


MAC

She was talking about... a "harvest 

of blood"...


Beat.


JEREMIAH

Old slave superstition. You sprinkle 

a little blood mixed with water on 

the crops, you get yourself a good 

harvest... So they say.


MAC

"Blood?"


Beat.


JEREMIAH

Chicken blood. -- Anyway... don't 

you worry about ol' Jesse. She won't 

be bothering anyone no more.


INT. LIVING ROOM - NIGHT - LATER


Keith tries to sleep, but doesn't look comfortable. He looks 

up at the shadowed wall next to him. Animal heads, stuffed 

by a taxidermist, stare back at him.


He looks at the urn containing cigars. It's still on the 

mantle.


Jeremiah walks past almost unseen.


A little spooked, Keith removes his .38 SPECIAL, checks if 

it's loaded --


KEITH

Yeah. That's what I'm talkin' about.


He puts it under his pillow.


INT. MAC'S BEDROOM - NIGHT


MAC's in a restless sleep on top of the bed. The wind has 

blown the letters around the room. He wakes suddenly.


Disoriented, he runs his hand on the wall above his head, 

feeling the rough texture of stained wallpaper.


From outside there's the soft strains of tinkling MUSIC... 

from a child's music box... barely discernible over the wind. 

But eerie...


Mac sits up in bed. Looks out the window to --


THE OLD BARN


That's where the sound is coming from.


As Mac stares...


There's a soft flicker of light from inside the barn... The 

flicker grows stronger... are those flames coming out under 

the barn doors?


KNOCK KNOCK.


The flames are gone. Nothing.


SUZIE (O.S.)

Mac?


With a jolt, Mac looks to the door.


He opens the door, a bit shaken. Suzie stands outside, in a 

sexy nightgown. Just a whisper of satin and chiffon. Very 

Victoria's Secret.


SUZIE

It's ten-thirty. I took the clothing 

option.


She gestures at her sheer nightgown.


SUZIE

Sort of.


She smiles at Mac. He gazes blankly at her --


SUZIE

Well, are you going to invite me in? 

It's cold out here!


Mac looks at her breasts --


MAC

I can see that.


She steps inside. Mac shuts the door. Suzie wastes no time. 

She locks him in a passionate clinch. They kiss.


But Mac's not responding.


SUZIE

What's wrong?


MAC

This... used to be Jethro's room. 

The attic.


SUZIE

So?


MAC

When I was a kid... I was never 

allowed up here...


Suzie moves closer --


SUZIE

That turns me on even more... 

forbidden fruit always tastes better. 

Especially... the cherry.


Suzie starts kissing Mac. He's not responding.


SUZIE

What do you want? His permission? No 

problem.


She puts her fingers to her temples, a "mock seance" --


SUZIE

I'm talking to the spirit of Jethro 

Macdonald. Is it okay to have sex in 

your old attic with your grandson? 

We'll be careful of the bed --


MAC

Let it go.


SUZIE

I bet if he were still alive, he'd 

like to watch.


She caresses the bedpost --


SUZIE

Think of it... as a threesome. You. 

Me. And... "Jethro."


MAC

I said that's enough!


Mac grabs her roughly, pushing her against the wall.


Suzie stares at him like he's an alien.


SUZIE

Get a life!


-- and goes out the door, SLAMMING it.


INT. BUS - NIGHT


Two figures underneath a blanket at the back of the bus.


Having sex.


It's Rod & Candy. Then we hear Carl's voice.


CARL (O.S.)

Man. That was the weirdest funeral 

I've ever seen.


We MOVE to the front of the bus. IAN & CARL are chilling, 

totally ignoring the Kama Sutra going on in the back.


Ian's swigging from a bottle of Jack Daniels.


CARL

He almost brained that old lady with 

a shovel.


IAN

Must be a family feud, dude. You ask 

me... Mac's father's a few bales 

short of a haystack.


CARL

Maybe it runs in the family. Maybe 

all farmers go crazy after a while.


Ian finishes the whiskey, passes the empty bottle to Carl, 

who's disappointed.


IAN

I don't know. I could get used to 

life on a farm.


A cloud of SMOKE blows past Ian.


REVEAL ROD & CANDY, post-coital and now standing right behind 

them, naked and wrapped in a blanket. Rod's holding a joint.


ROD

Me too.


He grins, passing it to Ian and Carl --


Ian glances out the bus window. Did he just see a figure 

pass by?


INT. BARN - NIGHT


CLOSE ON the row of hanging FARM IMPLEMENTS, inside the barn.


A gloved HAND reaches out -- and selects the SCYTHE, pulling 

it off its hook. We get the feeling it's not going to be 

used... for harvesting corn tonight.


EXT. SMALL FARMHOUSE - NIGHT


A modest FARM HOUSE in the vicinity of the Macdonald farm.


It belongs to JESSE, the old woman we saw at the funeral.


Jesse's outside, standing by a bonfire, engaged in a Pagan 

ritual of protection.


She throws a STRAW DOLL into the fire. The flames quickly 

turn it to ash.


She sprinkles some sort of SPICE on the fire. It FLARES up 

wildly, with the force of a photographic flash.


And as it does --


A FIGURE is suddenly visible... standing on the other side 

of the bonfire.


The intruder wears a grotesque burlap-stitched mask over its 

head. Dressed in farmer's overalls... and boots that we've 

seen before. -- a hellish human SCARECROW.


-- And in its hand... the long curved blade of a SCYTHE.


The blade of the Reaper.


JESSE... starts backing away, her eyes fixed tight on the 

SCARECROW, a look of fear and possibly recognition on her 

face --


-- And she turns and runs. Into the house --


INT. SMALL FARMHOUSE (LIVING ROOM) - CONTINUOUS


Breathing sharply, JESSE SLAMS the FRONT DOOR, locking it 

and leaning against it. Safe only for a moment, because --


CRASH -- the blade of the SCYTHE rips through the wood... 

inches from her face.


JESSE screams. She runs towards the KITCHEN, as the SOUND of 

splintering wood rings out and --


INT. KITCHEN


JESSE frantically searches drawers for a weapon. A knife?


INT. LIVING ROOM


THE front WINDOW PANE breaks open -- A hand reaches in to 

open the latch. Jesse runs -- the SCARECROW is now inside.


On the walls of the house: Straw dolls, symbols and other 

hand-made articles of protection. The SCARECROW slices at 

them with the scythe, cutting them to shreds.


Then the Scarecrow stops. Listening... trying to determine 

where its prey has gone.


EXT. BACK OF FARMHOUSE - NIGHT


The SCARECROW comes out the back door.


Moonlight. Except for the crickets... and soft clucking of 

chickens, it's quiet.


The Scarecrow looks around. Where did she go?


INT. CHICKEN HOUSE


It's a long structure with hundreds upon hundreds of chickens -- 

a real chicken nightmare.


JESSE crouches inside the structure, terrified, trying not 

to make a sound. Through the small SLATS, we can see the 

SCARECROW walking slowly past.


EXT. BACK OF FARMHOUSE - CONTINUOUS


The SCARECROW pauses, then starts to head away towards the 

cornfield. She's fooled him!


INT. CHICKEN HOUSE


JESSE relaxes ever so slightly, as the SCARECROW moves away.


HER FOOT.. touches one of the chickens! It starts clucking --


EXT. BACK OF FARMHOUSE


The SCARECROW.... whips its head around, hearing --


INT. CHICKEN HOUSE


JESSE cringes, praying she's still safe.


CRASH! The SCARECROW's inside --


The CHICKENS freak, going crazy, flapping their wings--


The SCARECROW'S boots trample on EGGS, smashing them. A chaos 

of chickens and feathers, trampled eggs and crazy pecking.


Still crouching, JESSE desperately raises her hands to ward 

off the blade --


She screams --


The blade, sticky through the mist of chicken blood and 

feathers, slices the air in a shiny arc --


And comes to rest with a sickening thump in Jesse's chest.


As her blood drains out -- The blade swings again, and again --


EXT. FARM - SUNRISE


The red and orange flare of the rising sun.


INT. BUS - SUNRISE


Candy in Rod's arms.


In the front, Ian & Carl. All asleep.


COCK A DOODLE DO!


-- a ROOSTER crows.


INT. LIVING ROOM - SUNRISE


KEITH wakes up, opens one eye, hung-over, not happy about 

the rooster.


INT. FARM HOUSE PASSAGE - LATER


SUZIE, now dressed, walks down the passage. The ROOSTER crows 

again, as Suzie walks into --


INT. LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS


KEITH is up, hung-over and standing in his underwear, aiming 

his .38 Special through the window. Suzie groans.


SUZIE

It's a farm, Keith. You're not 

supposed to shoot the rooster.


KEITH

He started it.


SUZIE

You seen Mac? His bed hasn't been 

slept in.


KEITH

(beat)

What?! You mean... I slept on this 

couch for nothing?!


INT. BARN - MORNING


A figure sprawled on a bed of hay. Head to the side, legs 

and arms akimbo. No sign of movement. It's MAC. The barn 

door swings open. Sunlight floods in.


Suzie's found him, Still angry from the night before, she 

kicks his boot.


SUZIE

Hey --


No reaction. She bends over, shakes him --


SUZIE

Mac!


A groan from the floor. Mac raises his head, instinctively 

shields his eyes against the light --


SUZIE

We're almost ready. What the hell 

are you doing out here?


MAC

I... heard something... came in here 

last night. Must have gone to sleep.


He clutches his head in agony. Slowly, he sits up, brushing 

some hay from his clothes. His hand is cut.


SUZIE

How'd you get that? Playing with 

your pitchfork?


MAC

Picked up one of those shears. Blade's 

razor sharp. -- Where is everyone?


SUZIE

Getting ready.


MAC

Look. You want to talk about this?


SUZIE

I don't think so. Keith's about to 

use the rooster for target practice. 

Besides... you didn't seem too 

interested last night.


Mac pulls her down on top of him --


MAC

Strange... I can feel my old self 

coming back...


SUZIE

Mmmm -- so can I...


A-HEM. Someone clears their throat.


Mac and Suzie look up to see Jeremiah standing in the doorway. 

Frustrated, Suzie gets up.


SUZIE

Morning Jeremiah.


But Jeremiah keeps his eyes leveled on Mac.


JEREMIAH

Mornin'.


A beat. Suzie turns and looks at Mac --


SUZIE

Better get a move on. Or I won't be 

able to guarantee the safety of the 

old Macdonald cock much longer.


Jeremiah raises an eyebrow, as Suzie exits.


JEREMIAH

Women. Can't live with 'em... can't 

shoot 'em... Without good reason.


Mac half-smiles.


The SCYTHE is back where it was. A smear of blood on the 

blade.


EXT. FARM - MORNING


Jeremiah sits in an old wooden chair on the porch, whittling 

a small piece of wood with a pocket KNIFE.


The BAND MEMBERS are getting ready to leave, getting on the 

bus.


KEITH is fastening the dirtbike to the back of the bus.


BILLY BOB

Sure gonna miss you boys... Need a 

hand with that?


Billy Bob grins, spits tobacco a little too near Keith's 

Nikes.


Over near the HOUSE, MAC walks up to Jeremiah, who's whittling 

a piece of wood. Mac pauses, trying to figure out how to say 

goodbye.


Jeremiah glances at the cut on Mac's hand. Then --


JEREMIAH

You'll be back.


MAC

I don't think so.


He holds out his hand to Mac. Reluctantly, Mac reaches out 

to shake it.


Jeremiah squeezes. A drop of Mac's blood falls into the dust.


JEREMIAH

You're a Macdonald. It's in your 

blood.


INT. BUS - MORNING


THE BAND MEMBERS


...take their seats.


Candy is already sitting by herself, turning over a deck of 

Tarot Cards. As Suzie moves past her --


SUZIE

(dryly)

Let me guess. We're going on a "long 

trip".


CANDY

(turning over a card)

Not according to these.


Mac enters the bus, sits down by Suzie. She notices his hand, 

bleeding slightly.


Carl starts the bus. KEITH couldn't be happier.


KEITH

Hallelujah! ...Civilization... here 

I come!


SUZIE

(under her breath)

Amen.


THEIR POV: THE FARM


-- Through the windows of the bus, receding into the distance.


Jeremiah just stares.


Billy Bob waves and grins.


In response, looking through the window, KEITH gives him the 

finger. Billy Bob smiles, and gives him the finger back.


MAC, alone in his seat, glances down at the cut on his hand.


CUT TO:


EXT. COUNTRY ROAD - MORNING - MOMENTS LATER


Churning up dust, the BUS thunders down the bumpy country 

road, a few miles from the farmhouse. Rock music blaring.


Suddenly, there's a horrible grinding sound. The bus SWERVES -- 

and the engine CUTS out. The bus comes to rest in a thick 

cloud of dirt.


INT. BUS


CARL, at the steering wheel, tries to restart it. No dice. 

Just a dead clicking sound.


CANDY

Is it supposed to do that?


The others glare at her.


EXT. COUNTRY ROAD - MORNING - LATER


The broken-down BUS on the side of the road, with its HOOD 

up. Sitting in the dirt, hot and bothered, the BAND are 

lounging around, waiting for Carl to return with help.


Then, in the distance, almost like a mirage --


A TRACTOR, slowly making its way towards them.


EXT. COUNTRY ROAD - MOMENTS LATER


The TRACTOR pulls to a halt. CARL is sitting on the back.


And in the driver's seat, with a grin on his face... Billy 

Bob, enjoying the moment.


BILLY BOB

(especially to Keith)

Long time... no see.


EXT. MACDONALD FARM - LATER


The BUS has been towed back to the farm. Suzie and Carl are 

looking under the hood. The others are gathered around.


SUZIE

Looks like the alternator.


CARL

Yeah. It's the alternator all right.


SUZIE

How would you know? You're looking 

at my tits.

(Beat)

Jesus, Carl. Your job is to keep us 

on the road!


CARL

I didn't do anything --


KEITH

Yeah. That's just the problem.


MAC

Tell me you checked the bus before 

we left, Carl.


BILLY BOB has come out of the house, walks over to them --


BILLY BOB

Just talked to Orwell down at the 

garage. Says getting a new alternator 

for your bus is no problem.


KEITH

(pumps his fist)

Alright!


BILLY BOB

Could take a little while, though.


KEITH

What's a "little while?"


BILLY BOB

Two.. maybe three days.


Everyone groans.


KEITH

What?!! I can't fuckin' believe this!! 

You mean we're stuck in Redneck River 

Valley without a ride?

(to Jeremiah)

No offense.


JEREMIAH

None taken. The Lord works in 

mysterious ways.


Mac locks eyes with Jeremiah.


CANDY

(whining)

Rod... I have to get back to my job.


SUZIE

Someone actually... employs you?


CANDY

I happen to be a professional.


SUZIE

Which street corner?


They're about to go at it again --


ROD

(grins)

She's a Tarot Card Reader at a 

shopping mall.


SUZIE

What a surprise. -- What about our 

audition?


JEREMIAH

If you're looking to practice... why 

don't you set up over there... in 

the barn?


While the others appraise the barn... Mac stares at Jeremiah.


EXT. BACK OF FARM - LATER


IAN wanders up to KEITH, a bottle in hand. KEITH is standing 

with his .38 in his hand in a firing stance. MAC's watching.


Irritated with the band's time wasting.


BLAM!


As KEITH pulls the trigger, we see --


Several TIN CANS, placed on a FENCE as targets.


A TIN CAN goes flying. Keith shoots again.


Suzie walks up behind Keith.


SUZIE

(sarcastic)

Having fun, Keith?


BLAM! KEITH misses again.


KEITH

Damn! You made me miss!


ON BILLY BOB


Leaning against a post nearby, watching. He spits tobacco 

into the dust.


BILLY BOB

Want me to move 'em a little closer 

for ya?


KEITH turns around --


KEITH

You think you can do better, "Billy 

Bob"??


Billy Bob grins. Walks over to Keith, who puts the gun in 

his hand. Billy Bob "hefts" it for a second -- and then in 

one deft, effortless MOTION --


BANG! BANG! BANG!


Three cans are blasted off the fence post. Billy Bob grins, 

pleased with himself. He hands the gun back to Keith.


BILLY BOB

Not bad. Prefer a shotgun myself. 

Comes in much more handy on a farm.

(pause)

'Course, your kind wouldn't know too 

much about that.


Keith bristles.


KEITH

My kind? You mean -- black people?


Billy Bob grins at him, spits.


BILLY BOB

Musicians.


EXT. BARN - DAY


CARL, the roadie, is unloading the band's equipment off the 

BUS, staggering under the weight.


The others are helping, move stuff to the barn. Candy picks 

up a single microphone to carry.


Jeremiah approaches Mac.


JEREMIAH

As long as you're stayin'... mind 

giving me a hand?


Jeremiah nods to a TRACTOR nearby.


MAC

Carl!


Mac motions to Carl to help Jeremiah --


JEREMIAH

(to Mac)

Actually, I was talkin' about you.


A moment as Mac looks at his father, then looks at the band.


Mac pauses, trying to decide.


JEREMIAH

May as well. They're having a good 

time shooting tin cans.


EXT. FARM - MOMENTS LATER


MAC's now reluctantly sitting next to Jeremiah on the TRACTOR. 

As they head off toward the fields --


MAC'S POV FROM THE MOVING TRACTOR


-- passing by the band members, deserting them.


Keith exchanges a "how could he do this?" look with Suzie.


Mac turns away.


EXT. MIDDLE OF FIELD - DAY


JEREMIAH and MAC are hard at work -- trying to remove a tree 

branch that's poked through the fence. The tractor's parked 

nearby.


JEREMIAH

Feel's good, doesn't it.

(pause)

Land. A man's born on it. A man's 

buried on it. In between you just 

got to do what you can to make a 

living. It ain't easy...


Mac has his shirt off, sweating in the sun.


He reaches down to the pile of tools nearby, picks up a sharp 

AXE, about to swing it.


Jeremiah grabs the axe handle suddenly.


JEREMIAH

Not that.


Mac glances at the handle. "Jethro Macdonald" is burned into 

the handle.


Jeremiah takes out another axe. --


JEREMIAH

Try this one...


Mac takes it, and with a sure hand, chops off the branch.


Jeremiah watches proudly.


Even Mac seems a little pleased with himself.


JEREMIAH

Just what I said this farm needs. A 

little new blood.


EXT. BACK OF FARMHOUSE - AFTERNOON


It's getting late. Mac hasn't returned yet. Keith comes out 

and the others come out of the barn.


KEITH

Guess Mac's still off on the 

"hayride".


Pissed-off, Keith spies the lone SCARECROW in the field.


He takes careful aim --


BLAM!


THE SCARECROW is hit, slumps over on its post.


EXT. BARN - MAGIC HOUR - LATER


Finally returning from the field, Jeremiah stops the tractor 

by the barn. Mac looks at Jeremiah, the beginning of a strange 

bond forming between them.


Mac pushes open the barn door.


INT. BARN


The band's equipment is all set up. But the band are nowhere 

to be seen. Mac's missed the practice.


Leaving Mac alone, Jeremiah drives the tractor toward the 

back of the house --


A SCARECROW


...starting to stand up in the sun. We PULL BACK, REVEALING --


EXT. FIELD - MORNING


JEREMIAH is in the cornfield, FIXING the Scarecrow that Keith 

shot. He hoists it up, affixing to a pole.


He looks over his shoulder, hearing, LOUD ROCK MUSIC, coming 

from... THE BARN.


INT. BARN - DAY


The BAND... are attempting to play an upbeat rock number.


Billy Bob and Candy are their "audience".


Mac is playing rhythm guitar, but he seems to have something 

else on his mind. Suzie looks across at him, perturbed. Then 

something else distracts her. She holds up her hand, stops 

the music --


SUZIE

Hold it, hold it. Aren't you 

forgetting something, Rod?


ROD

Like what?


SUZIE

Like your guitar break.


ROD

It's coming right up. After the third 

verse.


SUZIE

Second verse!


ROD

Jeez, what's the difference? Just 

'cause it's rock 'n roll, doesn't 

mean it's be set in stone.


Suzie looks at Mac. He looks pale.


KEITH

You wanna know the difference? The 

difference is that you're screwing 

up the song.


ROD

Yeah. Sure. I'm screwing up the song. 

You're the one who's been two beats 

behind since we kicked it off.


Mac isn't paying attention.


MAC'S... sweating, staring transfixed.


KEITH

What the fuck you talking about, 

man?


SUZIE

He's right. You were behind.


But Suzie's distracted, watching Mac carefully. Max plugs 

his lead into one of the mixing consoles. Blood gushes down 

the perspex channels...


KEITH

Bullshit! Next thing you'll be telling 

me, black man don't have rhythm!


-- and then, as Mac watches, the BLOOD is gone... just as 

quickly as it appeared.


KEITH

Yo. "Billy Bob". Was I two beats 

behind, or what?


BILLY BOB

(shaking his head)

Nope.


KEITH

See?


BILLY BOB

You were a beat and a quarter behind.


KEITH

Fuck you! If you're such an expert 

on music, why don't you go get your 

dueling banjo and sit in on the next 

song?


BILLY BOB

I ain't never played a banjo in my 

life.


Billy Bob stands over Keith's electric organ... plays a burst 

of Toccata and Fugue with flawless grace and precision. He 

stops, grinning widely at Keith --


BILLY BOB

...but I do play some organ in church 

on Sundays.


Mac looks at the cut on his hand. It looks worse. He takes 

his guitar off. It hits the ground with a SQUELCH of FEEDBACK.


MAC

(sour)

You guys figure it out. I'm taking a 

break.


KEITH

Yeah. Good idea. Go milk the cows, 

feed the chickens.


Mac walks out, slamming the barn door. Keith looks at everyone 

innocently, especially Suzie.


KEITH

...What?


EXT. FARMHOUSE - LATE AFTERNOON


Mac examines the small carved figure he received from Billy 

Bob at the club. It's slightly burnt, with the stem snapped 

off. He picks at the stem with a small penknife and looks 

around and picks up a piece of wood which he examines and 

starts to whittle.


Suzie walks up to find Mac. She watches him whittling a small 

piece of wood, trying to fit a stem onto the figure.


SUZIE

You wanna tell me what's going on?


Mac looks up. He's preoccupied with the stem and the damaged 

figure.


MAC

You wouldn't understand.


SUZIE

You never had trouble communicating 

before.


Mac pauses in his whittling. Then goes back to it.


Suzie loses it. She grabs the knife and wood from his hand.


SUZIE

What's wrong with you? Look, if you 

want to bail on me, that's fine. But 

not the band.


She throws the stem and the figure on the ground.


SUZIE

Keith's right. The sooner we get off 

this farm... the better.


Mac watches her. He picks up the figure.


INT. LIVING ROOM - LATE AFTERNOON


ON KEITH'S GUN


-- resting on a table. KEITH, in his socks, is taking a nap 

on the couch. Suddenly, we hear a loud MOOOOOOOO, from a 

cow.


Keith wakes up -- and glances at the floor. Something's 

missing.


His expensive Nikes are gone. He gets down on his hands and 

knees, feeling around under the couch.


Nope. No Nikes.


KEITH

Shit!!


Keith grabs his gun, heading out --


EXT. FARM - LATE AFTERNOON


KEITH walks across the yard, gun in hand, really pissed.


He's barefoot, stepping on rocks and brambles --


KEITH

Ow! Fuck. Ow!!


INT. BARN - LATE AFTERNOON


Suzie, Carl, Rod and Candy are in the barn by their 

instruments. They're listening to a track they recorded 

earlier, on their MIXING-DESK.


KEITH bursts in, a volcano about to explode. He has the .38 

tucked in his belt.


KEITH

Did any of you take my Nikes?


They all stare at him blankly.


KEITH

-- That's what I thought.


Keith removes his gun and takes off. The others look at one 

another. This could be trouble.


EXT. BACK OF FARMHOUSE - LATE AFTERNOON


Billy Bob is hoeing the garden by the side of the house.


Suddenly -- KEITH comes out of nowhere --


KEITH

Okay, Farm Boy. Joke's over. You've 

been playin' me from jump street. 

Where's my Nikes?


BILLY BOB

Nikes? What-the-hail you talkin' 

about?


Billy Bob spits some tobacco... a little too close to Keith's 

bare feet.


MAC and the OTHERS rush to the scene and freeze.


MAC

Keith!


Keith ignores them, THROWS Billy Bob up against the fence... 

and puts his .38 to Billy Bob's head.


KEITH

Listen to me, you banjo-dueling, 

country ass hayseed... I want my 

Nikes and I want them now!


BILLY BOB

You... think... I... stole... your... 

fancy shoes? I... wouldn't... be... 

caught... dead in 'em.


Keith loses it, cocks his .38 SPECIAL at Billy Bob's temple.


Billy Bob continues to smile, almost daring him to pull the 

trigger --


KEITH

I'm gonna count to three. One. Two --


And a HAND GRABS KEITH, whipping him around.


KEITH'S POV:


It's MAC. He punches Keith in the face. Keith takes a swing 

back, pinning Mac against the barn. Mac throws him off with 

force.


Keith hits the dust. Blood trickles from his mouth. His gun 

goes flying.


Mac picks up the gun... levels it at Keith.


MAC

How does it feel, Keith?


KEITH

Fuck you! Fuck all of you! I'm done 

kickin' it with cows and roosters. -- 

And drinking moonshine with Johnny 

Cash! Senior AND Junior!


MAC

Is that right?


KEITH

Yeah, that's right! I'm outta here -- 

Y'all can kiss my city ass goodbye!... 

I'm gone with the wind.


Keith pulls the gun out Mac's hand.


KEITH

And fuck you too. You're just as 

crazy as all of 'em... "Macdonald."


It's probably the first time Keith's ever called Mac by his 

last name.


MAC

(ice)

You're talking about my family.


Beat.


KEITH

...I don't even know you any more, 

man.


Mac stares coldly as Keith tucks his gun in his pants.


JEREMIAH puts his hand on Mac's shoulder -- a father 

comforting a son. This doesn't go unnoticed by Suzie.


As Keith storms off --


EXT. FARM HOUSE - MAGIC HOUR


VRRRRROOOOM. As an old pair of shoes kick start the DIRTBIKE.


It's Keith. Steaming mad. He's packed his things and he's 

leaving.


By the house, Suzie, Carl, Ian, Rod & Candy watch grimly.


IAN

Well, there goes our record deal.


ROD

Nah. We still got Billy Bob.


He mimics Billy Bob's keyboard moves with his hands. Rod 

snickers.


Keith PEELS OUT on the bike, leaving the bus -- and the farm 

behind in a cloud of dust.


EXT. FARMLAND ROAD - DUSK


The light of a DIRT-BIKE cutting like a blade through the 

growing darkness. The harvest moon overhead.


On the bike, KEITH, speeds furiously away from the farm.


He opens the throttle as the wind whips at his face.


EXT. FURTHER DOWN THE ROAD - MOMENTS LATER


Keith's making good time on the bike. Something catches his 

eye by the SIDE OF THE ROAD. He hits the brake, stopping the 

dirtbike suddenly in a cloud of dust.


ON THE SIDE OF THE ROAD:


He sees a SCARECROW. Perched on two pieces of wood in front 

of the cornfield. It wasn't there before... was it?


Burlap-stitched face. Overalls. Straw. And...


KEITH squints at it. It can't be.


Getting off his bike, he moves closer to the Scarecrow... as 

we follow his gaze:


For, on the Scarecrow's feet... are Keith's Nikes.


KEITH

MotherFUCKER!!!!


Keith whips out his 38 SPECIAL... shouts into the cornfield, 

pointing his gun wildly --


KEITH

You think this is funny, Billy Bob?!!


Nothing but corn, waving slightly in the breeze. Keith cocks 

his pistol --


KEITH

Why don't you come on out, hillbilly, 

and we'll "talk" about it?!!


No answer from the cornfield. Nothing.


KEITH

(to himself)

Yeah. Didn't think so. Fuckin' 

redneck...


Keith tucks the gun in his belt. He starts to remove his 

three hundred dollar Nikes from the Scarecrow.


He pulls on the right shoe. It's not coming off so easily.


He tugs on it again.


And again. Finally, he succeeds in pulling it off -- revealing -- 

A human foot.


KEITH

What the... f--


Keith reaches up toward the burlap Scarecrow mask.


He YANKS it off --


It's a human face.


Although Keith doesn't recognize her, we do. It's Karen, one 

of the teenagers who was murdered earlier.


Keith turns around to scream into the night -- when he comes 

face to face with --


Another SCARECROW. Now standing behind him. And this one's 

quite alive. It holds a SCYTHE in its hand.


KEITH

Yaaaaaaaaaa!


As the blade of the scythe goes into Keith's thigh like 

butter.


Keith staggers backwards, falls. Unable to walk, he tries to 

crawl backwards... and away.


The Scarecrow watches, almost studying its prey.


And in his terror and pain, Keith remembers... his pistol!!


He might just survive this after all.


He removes it from his belt, summoning all his courage.


The Scarecrow calmly watches, as Keith raises the pistol, 

shakily aiming at the burlap face.


KEITH

You should have asked the wizard for 

some brains, asshole.


Triumphant, Keith squeezes the TRIGGER and --


CLICK. Huh?


KEITH pulls the trigger again. And again.


Click. Click. Click. Nothing.


THE SCARECROW -- dramatically opens its gloved fist. ALL of 

Keith's bullets slowly hit the ground.


Somehow, someone has previously removed them from Keith's 

gun.


The Scarecrow HACKS Keith again with the scythe. The gun 

clatters to the dirt.


Blood spurting, Keith begins crawling away. If he can just 

somehow get to his dirt bike...


Taking its time, the SCARECROW advances... closer... closer.


Raises the scythe one last time...


CUT TO:


A TAROT CARD BEING TURNED OVER.


It's "The three of swords". (three swords sticking into a 

bloody heart)


We REVEAL we're in --


EXT. GRAVEYARD - NIGHT


Candles are burning. Candy sits cross-legged, by herself, 

doing a night reading. It's spooky. She looks at the card, 

unsettled.


Suddenly, she hears footsteps and looks up.


It's SUZIE... coming into the candlelight.


The two women regard one another. Another fight?


SUZIE

Hi.


CANDY

...Hi.


SUZIE

...You any good with those?


An attempt at reconciliation. Candy half smiles, holds out 

the deck of cards.


CANDY

Shuffle.


EXT. CORNFIELD - NIGHT


WE PAN SLOWLY ACROSS --


-- Rows of corn, illuminated by the bright light of the 

harvest moon. Amidst the chirping of cicadas, we hear familiar 

voices --


IAN (O.S.)

You're out of your mind, man.


ROD

I am not! I'm telling you, it's worth 

its weight in gold.


IAN

Let me get this straight... we're 

talking about manure?


THE CAMERA FINDS --


-- Rod and Ian, leaning against the business end of a gigantic 

COMBINE HARVESTER and THRESHER. It's in silhouette.


They're sharing an impressive-looking MARIJUANA spliff --


ROD

The ancient Aztecs knew how powerful 

this stuff was.


IAN

(after a moment's 

thought)

Cowshit? Are you sure the Aztecs 

even had cows?


Rod hands him the joint, as he ponders this.


ROD

Manure is the very essence of what 

we eat and who we are. Matter of 

fact, you're even smoking some of it 

right now.


Ian, midway through a deep puff, nods thoughtfully, and then -- 

HACKS and SPLUTTERS like a first-time smoker.


IAN

Are you crazy?


ROD

Sprinkled a pinch of manure in there 

just before I rolled it.


Rod grins. Ian contemplates the joint, eyes Rod suspiciously, 

draws on it again --


IAN

Hmmm. This shit isn't bad.


ROD

Manure... is life.


He takes a puff.


A beat, as they sit stoned.


IAN

What are we leaning against?


CUT TO:


A TAROT CARD BEING TURNED OVER:


The Moon card.


INT. GRAVEYARD - NIGHT


CANDY

You have a strong unfufilled desire.


SUZIE

Yeah. To get the hell off this farm.


CANDY

No. This is something spiritual. An 

ambition.


SUZIE

The band.


She turns over another card: The Empress.


SUZIE

Me?


Candy smiles, turns over another card.


CANDY

The ten of Swords.


EXT. CORNFIELD - NIGHT - MINUTES LATER


Rod and Ian are exploring the innards of the COMBINE 

HARVESTER, peering at the blades and rollers. They look almost 

like... swords.


ROD

This, my friend, is the most powerful 

farm machine known to man. A combine 

harvester and thresher.


Ian nods thoughtfully.


IAN

So... what does it do?


ROD

It harvests! It threshes! Look at 

these blades.


He uses his hands to demonstrate --


ROD

Go ahead. Feel for yourself.


It's the last thing on earth Ian wants to do --


ROD

Come on, man. What kind of pussy are 

you?


Ian plucks up the courage --


REVERSE ANGLE --


Ian'S HAND, slowly... getting closer... poking through the 

front of the harvester.


Getting even closer to the sharp blades...


Then, just as he touches the BLADE --


WHOOMPH!!!


The COMBINE HARVESTER ENGINE STARTS UP.


Ian withdraws his hand -- just IN THE NICK OF TIME as the 

Harvester Roars to Life. The BLADE draws a thin gash of BLOOD 

on his wrist.


The harvester's HEADLIGHTS snap on, blazing, its ENGINE 

roaring -- Rod and Ian are trapped in the beams of light, 

like scared rabbits.


And then, the engine is CUT, dying. A SILHOUETTE walks out 

in front of the headlights, directly in front of them.


IT'S BILLY BOB.


BILLY BOB

You boys... alright?


IAN

(furious)

What the hell are you doing?!


BILLY BOB

My job. I always move the harvester 

to the south field before sunrise.


ROD

You could have killed us!


Billy Bob grins at them.


BILLY BOB

Guess I didn't see you there... this 

time of night.


Billy Bob sniffs the air --


BILLY BOB

What's that funny smell?

(pause)

It smells like...


ROD

Manure.

(to Ian)

Come on. Let's go back to the house.


Rod shepherds Ian away --


IAN

Asshole.


OFF BILLY BOB, who watches with a grin on his face.


INT. GRAVEYARD - SAME TIME


Candy turns over another card.


CANDY

Aha. The Lovers.


SUZIE

Not lately.


Suzie reaches out to turn over the last card. Hesitates.


CANDY

That's the opposing card.


What lies ahead you will have to confront.


Suzie turns it over.


CANDY

The devil.


The candle begins to FLICKER -- suddenly goes out. The girls 

are now in complete DARKNESS. In a graveyard. They gasp.


Beat.


Candy lights a match, illuminating her face. She lights a 

candle.


They giggle at themselves for being scared. A bonding moment.


EXT. FARM HOUSE - MORNING


The rooster, crowing loudly at the break of the day.


INT. FARM (LIVING-ROOM) - SAME TIME


The couch is empty. No Keith. The rooster -- his sunrise 

nemesis -- has outlived him.


INT. MAC'S BEDROOM - MORNING


Mac has just got up. He looks on the dresser. There's a long 

mahogany case that wasn't there before.


He stares at it.


JEREMIAH (O.S.)

Little present.


Mac turns to see Jeremiah standing in the doorway.


JEREMIAH

Go ahead. Open it.


Mac does.


Inside... is Jethro's favorite axe. It's Mac's now.


EXT. FARM - AFTERNOON


The axe, raised high, and then cutting a deep gash into a 

heavy block of wood. Mac is hard at work, chopping firewood.


He stops for a moment, wipes his brow, and looks across at 

the farmhouse, where he sees --


THE REST OF THE BAND


-- Rod, Ian, Suzie, and Carl are standing together, talking. 

And not about the weather.


Although we can't hear what they're saying, it's clear that 

they're talking about Mac. Mac's become an outcast.


Mac grits his teeth. He swings the axe high again as --


We hear the SOUND of a car pulling up on the GRAVEL outside.


It's the SHERIFF'S car. GENE the Preacher is driving.


Only this time, he's wearing his Sheriff's hat. All dressed 

in khaki, with a gun on his hip. Hearing the car, Jeremiah 

steps out of the farmhouse and walks onto the driveway.


The sheriff gets out of the car.


JEREMIAH

Gene.


GENE

Missed you at church this morning, 

Jeremiah.


JEREMIAH

You're not going to arrest me for 

it, are you?


GENE

Hell, no. But you missed a damn good 

sermon. "You can't hide a wicked 

heart from the eyes of the Lord."


JEREMIAH

Sounds familiar.


GENE

Book of Jeremiah.


Across the yard, the others are watching.


CARL

(puzzled)

Hey, isn't that the preacher?


SUZIE

Find out what's holding things up. I 

want to get the hell off this farm.


ON JEREMIAH


JEREMIAH

You here on official business?


Gene produces a couple of small PHOTOGRAPHS from his pocket.


SHERIFF

Couple a teenagers from the next 

county went missin' last week on 

their way to a concert. Parents think 

something might have happened to 

'em. Take a look. Maybe you seen 'em 

before.


JEREMIAH looks at the PHOTOGRAPHS.


A pause. Jeremiah seems uneasy. Is that a flash of recognition 

in his eyes? He hands the photographs back --


JEREMIAH

Oh yeah. These two. Buried 'em myself 

last week over by the cornfield.


Gene blinks.


JEREMIAH

Hell, Gene, I'm just yanking your 

chain! Never saw 'em before in my 

life. You know kids. Probably smashed 

up daddy's car, and now they're too 

afraid to go home.


Gene nods, unconvinced.


GENE

Yeah. Could be.


Gene glances over at the band, with Mac some distance away --


GENE

Thought your boy and his band were 

only staying the night.


JEREMIAH

Bus broke down.


Gene nods. Then studies the others.


BOB

Where's the black fella?


JEREMIAH

He's been axed. From the band.


EXT. WOODED AREA - DUSK


A small, rusty old shed, hidden amongst the trees and 

undergrowth, some distance from the main property.


The door opens. Jeremiah emerges, carrying two bottles of 

moonshine, with Gene in tow.


GENE

You know, one day I'm going to have 

to shut down that still of yours, 

Jeremiah.


JEREMIAH

Well, why don't you hold these as 

evidence in the meantime.


He winks, putting the bottles of moonshine in the back seat 

of the sheriff's car, parked nearby.


ON IAN & ROD


Behind a clump of bushes, observing them --


IAN

Should we be doing this, dude?


ROD

Metaphysical question, man.


EXT. BARN - NIGHT


SUZIE... all alone, walks to the old barn.


Standing in the shadows... is Billy Bob. He watches her.


Suzie pushes open the barn door, going inside.


INT. BARN - CONTINUOUS


It's very dark. A little moonlight. She seems to be looking 

for something. She clicks on her flashlight. The flashlight 

beam hits --


THE WOODEN BARN WALLS. A spiderweb. It moves along the walls, 

SUZIE hears a NOISE. Someone's in the barn with her.


SUZIE

Anybody here?


She WHIPS the flashlight beam to her right to reveal --


SOME OLD RUSTY FARM IMPLEMENTS hanging from the ceiling.


One is a farm machete. The tools swing slightly in the breeze.


Or did someone push them?


A FIGURE's standing right behind Suzie. She gasps. Then 

recognizes CARL. An odd look in his eyes.


Maybe it's just the beam of the flashlight, but he appears 

suddenly menacing and sinister.


SUZIE

Dammit, Carl!!!!


CARL

Sorry.


He lights a match, and touches it to the fuse of a KEROSENE 

LAMP. Shadows flicker on the walls. Carl smiles, thrilled to 

have Suzie to himself.


SUZIE

Okay, I'm here. What's with all the 

cloak and dagger shit?


Carl offers her some of his beer. She refuses. He takes a 

slug, takes his time.


CARL

There's something weird going on 

here, Suzie.


SUZIE

No shit.


CARL

I'm serious. Get this. I had a careful 

look at that alternator. It's clearly 

been messed with... it's not wear 

and tear that caused that breakdown...


SUZIE

You're saying someone's trying to 

keep us on the farm...?


CARL

Not someone -- Mac.


Suzie's unsure about this.


SUZIE

Why would he do that?


Carl leans in closer.


CARL

He doesn't want us to leave.


He's been acting weird ever since we got here.


SUZIE

Come on --


CARL

Suzie, face it. The only "axe" he's 

picked up since we came here... is a 

real one. He doesn't give a damn 

about the band anymore... or about 

you.


She looks up, stung.


CARL

You deserve better.


There's a loud clatter somewhere in the barn. Suzie starts.


SUZIE

Jesus. I don't know what's wrong 

with me Carl can't believe his luck. 

Suzie's jumped almost into his arms.


SUZIE

..I think I'll take you up on that 

beer after all.


She downs a long swig as Carl watches, his arm inching around 

her body. He begins stroking her arm.


CARL

I never told you this... but when I 

watch you up on stage, performing...


He works his fingers up towards her neck.


CARL

Something happens to me... something 

deep inside...


Carl reaches out, stroking her neck, moving his hand down.


Suzie closes her eyes resting her head against the coolness 

of the beer bottle.


CARL

You need someone who cares for you.


Suzie opens her eyes. Carl has his lips puckered, moving 

towards her -- his eyes closed romantically.


SUZIE

Carl, what are you doing?


CARL

You need someone who can protect 

you, Suzie.


Suzie stops Carl with her hand on his chest. She feels the 

shape in his pocket -- a foil-wrapped condom, visible through 

Carl's shirt pocket. She pulls it out, holding it delicately 

between her fingers.


SUZIE

With this?!!!


Carl groans. He's blown it.


Suzie turns to leave and notices Carl's CAMCORDER, 

strategically placed on a amplifier, facing them. She stops. 

The red "recording" light is on. Suzie explodes.


SUZIE

You're taping me?! You fucking 

pervert!


She picks up the Camcorder, hurls it hard at Carl. It misses 

him, lands on the straw.


SUZIE

I hope I broke it. Asshole.


Suzie exits, fuming, slamming the barn door. Carl picks up 

the CAMCORDER, checks to see it's still working --


The FLIP-SCREEN lights up. Whew.


CARL

(into the lens)

Note to self: Next time put condom 

in back pocket.


EXT. FARM - NIGHT


Suzie, having come from the barn, stops, hears movement in 

the corn field.


Someone's in there. Suzie freezes.


Suddenly -- ROD & IAN BURST through the corn.


They hold bottles of stolen moonshine, obviously pretty 

wasted.


ROD

"Old Macdonald... had --"


IAN

"-- an AXE!"


IAN & ROD

"E-I-E-I-Ohhh!"


They collapse into drunken laughter


IAN

"With a hack-hack here --"


ROD

"And a slash-slash there --"


IAN

Hi Suze.


SUZIE

-- Where have you two been?


ROD

Us? We been... moonlighting.


They burst out laughing, displaying the bottles.


IAN

He means moon shining.


ROD

Harvest moonshining!


IAN

Old Macdonald had some... MOONSHINE!


As they start to sing --


INT. BARN - SAME TIME


CARL's still in the barn, fiddling with his camcorder, humming 

one of the band's songs.


He looks closely at the camcorder screen.


ON THE SCREEN: A PAIR OF BLACK FARM BOOTS.


We've seen them before. They're moving closer.


And the camcorder's not on play. It's recording.


CARL

Huh?


CARL blinks. He looks up from the camcorder screen, just in 

time to see -- THE SCARECROW... bigger than life, right in 

front of him, swinging an AXE --


Carl DUCKS in the nick of time --


The camcorder goes flying, landing on some straw; CARL is 

freaking out, diving for his life.


The AXE whizzes past him --


CARL

Yaaaaaaaaa!


CUT TO:


IAN & ROD

(howling at the moon)

Awoooooooooooooo!


-- which covers the sound of Carl screaming. They're now in --


EXT. GRAVEYARD - NIGHT


Ian takes a sip of the moonshine --


ROD

Where's Mac?


SUZIE

Who knows? Just like a man... never 

around when you need them.


IAN

We're here...


INT. BARN - SAME TIME


The SCARECROW swings the AXE again --


CARL narrowly avoids the blade, but backs into the band's 

MIXING BOARD. It goes ON... and one of the band's SONGS starts 

playing through a loud speaker.


THE SCARECROW stops a second, reacting --


EXT. GRAVEYARD - SAME TIME


Suzie, Ian and Rod suddenly HEAR the MUSIC coming from the 

barn --


SUZIE

Carl. Probably playing with himself.


BACK TO:


INT. BARN - SAME TIME


As the SCARECROW moves closer, CARL picks up a Fender 

Stratocaster guitar. He holds it by the body, using the neck 

of the guitar as his weapon.


The band's song continues in the background, punctuating the 

action --


The AXE swings down at him -- and Carl BLOCKS it with the 

Fender -- CRASH -- part of Ian's DRUM KIT falls over.


EXT. GRAVEYARD - NIGHT - SAME TIME


IAN

Wait a second. Did you hear that?


ROD, IAN and SUZIE pause to listen a second.


ROD

Yeah, man. You were wrong, Suze. My 

solo definitely works better in the 

second verse.


IAN

He's right. Nice guitar break.


INT. BARN - SAME TIME


SMASH! The guitar BREAKS against the wall, as Carl swings 

it, missing the Scarecrow, and splintering into pieces.


The SCARECROW's axe rips across Carl's ARM, drawing blood.


CARL drops what's left of the guitar --


CARL

AAAAAAAAAAAA --


EXT. GRAVEYARD - SAME TIME


SUZIE

He should turn that music down. 

Jeremiah's gonna kill him.


INT. BARN - SAME TIME


CARL, bleeding, runs for the barn DOOR. If he can only get 

to it in time. The Scarecrow's right BEHIND him.


CARL reaches to open the barn door from inside, when --


TWAK!


The Scarecrow's axe plunges into his back.


EXT. GRAVEYARD - SAME TIME


Ian, Rod, and Suzie are still sitting in the graveyard, 

giggling. Suzie shouts out to the night --


SUZIE

Hey Carl -- kill the music!


INT. BARN


A gloved hand calmly reaches out... and flicks the switch.


The red light goes out. The MUSIC dies. And so does Carl.


EXT. FARM - SAME TIME


SUZIE, ROD & IAN

Thank you!!!


IAN, swaying on his feet, gets set to take another swig of 

moonshine. Suzie grabs the bottle from him --


IAN

Hey!


She swigs deeply, finishing the moonshine, as Ian and Rod 

look on in amazement. She wipes her mouth with the back of 

her hand.


SUZIE

Thanks. I needed that.


She hands the empty bottle to Ian.


EXT. FARM HOUSE - DAY


Establishing.


INT. BARN - DAY


The cock crows.


ROD, CANDY, IAN and SUZIE push open the barn door. Ian and 

Rod are especially hung-over from the night before.


ROD

(hung over)

My head feels like a goat sat on it.


CANDY

(you dick)

I wonder why.


Suddenly, they all FREEZE, staring in amazement.


The place has been TRASHED. IAN surveys his drumkit,... now 

strewn around the ground.


Rod picks up his smashed guitar.


ROD

My axe!!! Someone Jimi Hendrixed my 

axe!!!


Candy puts a sympathetic hand on his shoulder.


SUZIE

Carl.


ROD

CARL??? Carl did this?!!


SUZIE

Last night... he tried to get it on 

with me.


IAN

And...??


SUZIE

I'd rather have a paper cut. This is 

how he dealt with it.


IAN

Trashing our instruments??!


ROD

Someone better tell Mac.


SUZIE

Why bother?


IAN

When I find Carl... he's a dead man!


EXT. FARM - MACDONALD GRAVESITE (SAME TIME)


Mac's there... staring at the Macdonald tombstones.


A voice interrupts him.


BILLY BOB

Heard from Orwell down at the garage. 

Alternator should be here by the end 

of the day.


Mac nods. Not really interested. Billy Bob leans over, picks 

up an empty bottle of moonshine.


BILLY BOB

Come to pick out a plot for yourself?


Mac ignores him, stares at Jethro's grave.


BILLY BOB

'Course, some folks say 'ol Jethro 

shouldn't have been buried up here... 

with the rest of the Macdonalds.


MAC

Meaning?


BILLY BOB

Hell, he was your grandfather. You 

know what he did.


Mac seems puzzled. He turns to look Billy Bob in the eye --


BILLY BOB

Maybe you were too young to remember.


Billy Bob grins --


BILLY BOB

Maybe you don't want to remember.


MAC

What are you talking about?


BILLY BOB

'Course, it's none of my business.


MAC

Let's say today, we make it your 

business.


Billy Bob turns to leave -- stops. Turns around.


BILLY BOB

Why do you think your mother took 

you away from this place?


Now Mac's really interested.


BILLY BOB

You ever hear of... the harvest of 

blood?


MAC

(disdainfully)

Superstition.


BILLY BOB

Your grandfather sure believed in 

it. Worked pretty good... too.


MAC

Chicken blood on the crops.


BILLY BOB

(grins)

...Chicken blood? Who said it was... 

"chicken blood"?


That landed.


BILLY BOB

Sheriff says a couple of kids are 

missing. An' no one's seen Jesse for 

days. You ask me... someone's carrying 

on the Macdonald tradition...


Enraged, Mac GRABS Billy Bob.


BILLY BOB

Harvest should be pretty good soon....


Mac follows Billy Bob's look. In the middle of the corn is 

the derelict steel structure -- dry, shriveled corn rustling 

all around it.


He loosens his grip on Billy Bob... and walks back down the 

hill.


INT. BARN AREA - LATE AFTERNOON


Ian and Rod are hunting for Carl by the fence. Ian holds a 

baseball bat.


ROD

Carl! Oh Carrrrl!


IAN

Come out, come out wherever you are!


INT. BARN - LATE AFTERNOON


SUZIE's alone in the barn, looking for signs of Carl.


Through the mess, Suzie sees -- Carl's camcorder, lying on 

its side.


She picks it up, switches it on. She rewinds, then presses 

"play".


ON THE CAMCORDER SCREEN: A blur of images, shot from a low 

angle. Some kind of struggle going on, drowned out to the 

sound of blaring rock music. Things getting knocked over.


We can see Carl's feet -- and someone else's. In a pair of 

black farm boots.


SUZIE

...Carl...


Suzie -- fast-forwards -- to see:


ON THE CAMCORDER SCREEN:


A gloved HAND reaches toward the ground and pulls open what 

looks like a TRAP DOOR in the barn floor. That's all -- then 

the camcorder goes to STATIC.


SUZIE looks around, zeroing in on the exact location.


She brushes the hay away -- revealing -- the edge of a hidden 

trap door! She pulls the metal ring. It opens -- and as she 

looks down into it.


REVERSE ANGLE - LOOKING UP AT SUZIE


Her face peering over the edge, tentatively looking into 

darkness. She's not thrilled about this new development.


SUZIE

Okkkay.


Suddenly --


VOICE

Is Carl down there?


Suzie's startled. She turns to see... Candy, who's just come 

into the barn.


EXT. FIELD NEAR STEEL STRUCTURE - DAY


Jeremiah seems to be checking out part of the steel structure. 

Suddenly Mac appears through the cornstalks.


Jeremiah whirls, training his shotgun on him.


JEREMIAH

Damn, boy. I thought you were a 

gopher.


Jeremiah slowly leans the shotgun against the steel structure. 

Mac looks up at it.


JEREMIAH

You like it? Irrigation system. Your 

grandaddy built it himself. Saved 

the land from dying.


MAC

That's a good idea. Maybe we should 

have a little "talk" about grandaddy 

Jethro.


JEREMIAH

Sure. What do you want to know.


MAC

People say he was a murderer.


JEREMIAH

That's your grandfather you're talking 

about!

(pause)

I... know what people say. Heard 

it... all my life.


Jeremiah composes himself....


JEREMIAH

Rumors' thick as buttermilk around 

these parts. Your grandaddy was a 

great man.


INT. BILLY BOB'S SHACK - DAY


Billy Bob is sitting at a table in his old woodcutter shack. 

There's a row of bullets standing upended on the table in 

front of him. He takes a deep swig of moonshine.


He lifts a gun and starts to load the chamber.


But it's not just any gun. It's KEITH's gun. It belongs to 

Billy Bob now. As he loads the bullets --


BILLY BOB

Old Macdonald... had an axe... ei, 

ei oh...


INT. BARN - SAME TIME


Candy holds the ladder as Suzie descends down, down into --


INT. SECRET BASEMENT - SAME TIME


SUZIE is at the base of the ladder. She aims the beam of her 

flashlight at some old tools... pieces of farm equipment...


She listens a second, growing uneasy. No way she's staying 

here alone.


CANDY (O.S.)

Suzie???


SUZIE

(to herself)

The hell with this.

(shouts)

I'm coming back up!!!


As she's about to go back up the steps --


She hears a steady DRIP, DRIP, DRIP coming from somewhere.


Whatever it is, it doesn't sound good. She can't help herself. 

She's got to look. Steeling herself, she slowly shines her 

FLASHLIGHT, revealing --


Rusty old irrigation PIPES -- part of some bigger primitive 

contraption. Like the contraption we saw before the fire.


More tangled now, and rusty. But with the clear plastic sacs 

and clear pipes still ready for use.


Suzie leans back, pressing against a lever. The machine chokes 

to life, driven by the thunderous sound of a powerful pump.


INT. BARN - CONTINUOUS


Candy hears the strange noise, growing unnerved --


CANDY

Suzie...?


INT. SECRET BASEMENT - CONTINUOUS


Suzie, transfixed by the sight of the macabre machine coming 

to life, liquid gushing through the pipes and valves.


That's not water.


It's BLOOD.


Suzie jerks the torchlight to the source of the thunderous 

sound above her. She throws herself back, dropping her torch.


Blackness -- And the chaos of the machine rattling, sucking 

and pumping. And Suzie gasping for breath in the dark.


Suzie's in extreme shock. She's gasping, breathless into the  

dark --


SUZIE

Please... Help me...


She scrambles around on all fours trying to find the torch.


She's got it in her shaking hands with the beam still off.


She forces herself to shine the torch up to the source of 

the pipes... and sees --


Keith's dead body. Arms outstretched... like a scarecrow.


WE CATCH A BRIEF GLIMPSE:


A network of pipes and feeds are inserted into Keith's body --


Right next to him, in the same manner, is Carl.


Suzie SCREAMS --


EXT. FIELD - DUSK


Mac and Jeremiah hear Suzie's screams --


EXT. FARM - DUSK


-- and so do Rod & Ian --


INT. BARN - LATER - NIGHT


Suzie is sobbing. Everyone's in various states of 

incomprehension and panic. Mac SLAMS the trap door, having 

just taken a look... in the barn's basement.


Rod tries to comfort Candy, who's almost catatonic, holding 

her chakra crystal necklace tightly.


IAN

Fuck man! This is fucked! They're 

all dead! What the fuck's going on?


JEREMIAH

I'm telling you -- that basement 

hasn't been used for years. Slaves 

hid there... before the civil war --


ROD

We've got to call someone -- get the 

sheriff--


IAN

The Sheriff?! We don't need the 

sheriff!!! We need to get the hell 

out of here!


MAC

We've got to find out who did this --


ROD

No way, man -- I'm not going hunting 

for a serial killer!


MAC

Shut up! Let me think.


IAN

What's to think about? We all know 

what's going on!!

(points to Jeremiah)

It's him! Case closed!


JEREMIAH

-- You're saying I did this? You're 

saying I killed your friends?!


IAN

-- Killed them?? -- Bled them like 

sheep! We were next!


Ian clenches his fists and begins moving towards Jeremiah.


JEREMIAH

If I wanted you dead... I could kill 

you right now!


Jeremiah points his shotgun directly at Ian --


Ian freezes. Jeremiah lowers it slightly.


JEREMIAH

...I didn't do anything...


Mac grabs the shotgun, then grabs Jeremiah --


MAC

Then who?! Because someone wants 

another blood harvest. With human 

blood, Jeremiah! Just like Jethro! 

Who did he kill back then, Jeremiah? 

Farmhands? Transients? People no one 

would miss? "Crazy Old Macdonald!" 

But now... it's starting again, isn't 

it? Someone's picking up where Jethro 

left off!


JEREMIAH

-- It's not me!


MAC

(raging)

Who then, Jeremiah?? -- Who?!


Beat. And then --


SUZIE

Has anyone seen... Billy Bob?


Mac loosens his hold on Jeremiah.


Good question. Where the heck is Billy Bob?


INT. BILLY BOB'S SHACK - MOMENTS LATER - NIGHT


The DOOR bursts open -- as Mac, Ian, Candy, Suzie, Rod and 

Jeremiah enter. Mac is holding Jeremiah's shotgun.


Billy Bob's currently not at home.


ROD

Okay. Nobody here. Let's go.


It's a messy room. Old Magazine pictures on the walls.


Almost in a trance, Candy sits down, takes out her tarot 

cards.


There's an incriminating MACHETE with blood stains on the 

table. Mac stares at it, picks it up.


MAC

Looks like Billy Bob's been busy.


There's a tall, brown upright CUPBOARD by the kitchen sink, 

just begging to be opened.


Ian reaches out, pulling it --


SQUAWK!!!! -- Billy Bob's "pet CHICKEN" -- bursts out of the 

cupboard -- flapping, squawking -- and scaring the shit out 

of everybody.


Ian looks lamely at the others, he's just about wet his pants.


Suzie continues searching, opening drawers next to the sink.


Forks. Knives. Utensils. And then --


SUZIE

Oh my God.


She pulls out a .38 special from the drawer... with a pearl 

handle.


SUZIE

It's... Keith's.


They look at one another. Case closed. Billy Bob's the killer.


Mac takes Keith's gun... and is about to hand the shotgun to 

Jeremiah. Instead... hands it to Ian.


Jeremiah and Mac lock eyes. No trust.


Rod holds up a telephone wire.


ROD

It gets worse. He's cut all the phone 

lines.


SUZIE

(to Mac)

What'll we do?


As if in answer, Candy turns over a tarot card.


It's... Death.


Not exactly what Mac wants to see right now. He shoots out 

his arm, knocking the deck -- the cards flutter to the floor.


INT./EXT. PICKUP TRUCK - NIGHT


Ian, Rod, and Jeremiah sit in the back. Mac's behind the 

wheel, with Suzie and Candy next to him. He's turning the 

key in the ignition. The engine won't turn over.


MAC

Shit!


As they watch in silence, Mac gets out of the car, opens the 

hood. He holds up the wires, that have been severed. Game 

over. They're trapped.


EXT. EDGE OF FARM - NIGHT - MOMENTS LATER


Standing together, nervous. They have flashlights--


-- and they're armed to the teeth.


Ian has the SHOTGUN... Mac holds Keith's pistol. ROD holds a 

pitchfork, SUZIE holds a long kitchen knife. They're armed... 

except for Candy.


JEREMIAH

It's a twenty-minute walk to the 

next farm. We can phone from there. 

Quickest way is to cut through the 

field.


Beat. No one's sure who to trust.


MAC

(to Jeremiah)

After you.


CLICK-CLACK!


IAN pumps his shotgun, chambering a cartridge --


EXT. CORNFIELD - NIGHT


HIGH ANGLE


Jeremiah in front, Mac at the back, Suzie, Ian and Rod in 

the middle, walking through the cornfield. Nobody really 

trusting anyone else.


Their flashlights cast eerie beams across the moonlit 

cornfield.


They continue on for a while, in silence. Jeremiah is walking 

briskly ahead, almost out of sight.


They round a corner.


ROD

Wait a second... where's Jeremiah?


He's nowhere around. Vanished.


MAC

(loud whisper)

Jeremiah?


There's a strange rustling sound of corn. Something's not 

right -- even though they can still see Jeremiah's flashlight 

beam.


MAC

...Shit.


As Mac, Ian, Rod and Suzie go into the next ROW of corn...


...they see Jeremiah's FLASHLIGHT -- still lit, but hanging 

on an old, half-rotted SCARECROW, just rags and straw.


Jeremiah's gone!


SUZIE

Oh god.


Mac removes the flashlight from the old scarecrow. Sweeping 

the area, training his gun on the empty rows of corn.


And then suddenly they're BATHED IN BLINDING LIGHT! They 

shield their eyes, momentarily disoriented and blinded.


Two old, powerful lights at the top of the steel structure 

have switched on.


Suddenly, there's a WHIRRING, WHOOSHING SOUND, coming from 

among the rows of corn -- the band members duck in fear.


They're... drenched. As the sprinklers come on, Suzie, Ian, 

Rod, and Mac try to escape the onslaught. Within seconds, 

they're getting sprayed.


But something's wrong -- 'water' sparkles red in the light.


Suzie feels the sticky, warm sensation on her hand.


Suddenly her hands and face are covered in red... it's not 

just water.


SUZIE

Oh my God... it's...


A moment of stunned silence.


MAC

-- it's blood.


Candy screams. The group is freaked. They flee from the field 

in panic -- desperate to try to wipe the blood off.


The combine harvester parked nearby suddenly roars to life.


SUZIE

What the hell's that?


IAN

You don't want to know.


As it revs up, COMING STRAIGHT AT THEM --


MAC

Run!!!!!!!


Ian turns tail and sprints for his life -- in one direction, 

alone. SUZIE is frozen like a deer in the headlights.


THE HARVESTER is bearing down on them, and --


MAC PUSHES SUZIE into the cornfield, out of harm's way, just 

in time. Mac tries to get away himself... but he can't.


THE HARVESTER, bearing down on him, and --


MAC dives off the path into the cornfield, the HARVESTER 

close behind. He's on the ground now, and --


MAC'S POV: THE HARVESTER


Huge, looming about to run him over.


SUZIE

Mac!!! Maaaaac!


No answer.


Then all is quiet.


EXT. A ROW OF CORN - SAME TIME


CANDY, now alone, stumbles blindly along the rows of corn.


She just might make it. Lightning flares in the sky.


Up ahead, camouflaged by corn, she sees a CAR! A 

convertible... with the top slashed. Been sitting there for 

days.


The windows are dusty -- Maybe the keys are in it!


Candy scrambles closer, whips open the front door and sees --


Nothing. It's empty. She scoots inside, frantically looking 

for the keys. She hears someone coming... and slinks down... 

hiding.


EXT. ANOTHER PART OF THE CORNFIELD - NIGHT


Ian is lost in the maze of corn, separated from the group.


Has he escaped? Suddenly -- to his right -- the HEADLIGHTS 

come on -- and the HARVESTER revs up again -- coming straight 

for him.


IAN runs for his life, coming to the end of the corn row --

and falls against -- a BARBED WIRE FENCE. He clambers over 

the fence cutting himself on barbed wire as he does so.


ON THE HARVESTER


Coming closer...


ON IAN


struggling, trying to untangle himself. He's not going to 

make it.


THE HARVESTER looms over him. He swings around, bleeding and 

caught on the fence.


IAN

Fuck you in hell!!!


BLAM! BLAM!


IAN fires the SHOTGUN. The Harvester keeps on coming.


As the huge rotating motors PULL him and the fence into the 

whirling blades


IAN

AAAAAAAAAAAAAAA!!!!!!!!!


He's chopped meat.


ON THE CORN


As Ian's BLOOD is sprayed over the stalks, more bloody 

"irrigation" --


EXT. STILL ANOTHER PART OF THE CORNFIELD - NIGHT


SUZIE blindly continues on -- and comes face to face with --


THE SCARECROW. She gasps -- and then sees -- the scarecrow's 

hands across the pole -- MOVING! It's the killer. And Suzie's 

had enough of this shit --


SUZIE

Eat this!!!!


She kicks the scarecrow between the legs and THRUSTS her 

KNIFE straight into the scarecrow's chest all in one fluid 

move.


AND SHE SEES:


Blood. Coming from the wound. She pulls the knife out.


And hears a low moaning. She whips off the scarecrow's burlap 

"mask" to reveal --


Billy Bob. Duct tape over his mouth, unable to talk.


Someone's tied him up, dressed him up as the scarecrow.


As his wide dying eyes stare into hers, Suzie realizes she's 

made a mistake --


SUZIE

Noooooo!!!!! I'm... sorry --


Suzie backs away, and -- sensing something, WHIRLS AROUND to 

see --


Another SCARECROW. Not fastened to a pole, but standing in 

front of her.


An old hat, farm overalls --and a scary cross-stitched burlap 

bag over its face. It's the killer.


Before she can react, the Scarecrow's gloved HAND comes 

sweeping down, a long, sharp FARM SICKLE in its hand. It 

takes a chunk out of Suzie's shoulder.


The Scarecrow swings a second time. SUZIE avoids the blow 

anticipating and dropping back. She stabs the Scarecrow in 

the LEG!!


It buys her a few seconds... as she turns and runs... for 

her life. She's a strong runner. But it's a long and scary 

road.


EXT. FARM ROAD - NIGHT


It's started raining.


We're looking at the road that runs alongside the cornfield. 

The sound of rustling in the rows of corn, and --


Rod, scratched, bleeding, comes crawling out --


-- he just manages to stand on his feet on the edge of the 

road as an old FARM-TRUCK heads in his direction, headlights 

glaring --


He waves his arms, flagging the truck down --


ROD

Heyyy!!!!


It stutters to a halt.


The passenger door opens.


ROD

Listen -- we've --


Rod looks at the driver: a foxy-looking chick in overalls.


TRUCK DRIVER

Hey, you one of those musicians 

stayin' down on Macdonald's farm?


Rod, bloody, dazed, just stares.


TRUCK DRIVER (ORWELL)

Name's Orwell. Got yer alternator 

right here.


Orwell points at a cardboard box in the front of the truck


ORWELL

Say. You need a lift or somethin'?


Rod manages a grin. She's a lifesaver. As he jumps in --


EXT. FARMHOUSE - NIGHT - MOMENTS LATER


Bleeding, SUZIE has made her way back to the front door of 

the farmhouse. She pounds on the door. It's locked --


SUZIE

...please...


And then she sees the THRESHER'S HEADLIGHTS. It's far away... 

but it's coming towards the farm.


She glances over at... the barn. Possible safety.


EXT. BARN


She opens the barn DOOR... leaving a bloody handprint...


INT. BARN


Scared shitless, Suzie glances around. Is there a place to 

hide?


Silence. The sound of the Thresher's gone... but there's 

something else.


Footsteps. Someone -- or something's coming.


Empty-handed... she needs a weapon. She moves to the farm 

implements and scythes hanging from the hooks. She selects a 

SCYTHE.


But she's not tall enough! She can't pull it off the hook!


The FOOTSTEPS are getting closer. She can't remove the scythe --


Someone's now right outside the barn DOOR. SUZIE finally 

manages to pull the SCYTHE down off its hook, she's got it.


THE DOOR starts to creak open, SUZIE raises the scythe above 

her head to strike, she's going to really let this fucking 

Scarecrow have it, and --


It's MAC. Bloodied, ripped clothing, and hurting... but alive. 

They stare at one another -- Suzie's freaked, the scythe 

still poised to strike --


MAC

Suzie... it's me... Mac.


She finally gets a grip. She lowers the scythe... and falls 

into his arms, hugging him. Mac notices her bloody shoulder.


MAC

Suzie --


SUZIE

(a sobbing torrent)

Billy Bob's dead. -- We were wrong --

he didn't do anything. I-It's the 

scarecrow --


MAC

Wait a minute --


SUZIE

I... saw him -- he tried to kill me -- 

he's, he's -- still -- out there --


MAC

What are --


SUZIE

HE'S STILL OUT THERE!!!


MAC

-- You're not making sense!! What 

"Scarecrow"?


Suzie pauses. She looks down.


ON MAC'S LEG


He's dragging it behind him, limping slightly. There's blood 

on it -- a fresh wound.


Suzie freaks. She just stabbed the Killer in the leg.


...And now Mac's leg is bleeding.


SUZIE

You're... limping.


MAC

I hurt my leg. Diving away from the 

Harvester -- it almost got me.


Suzie stares at him. Suzie picks up the scythe again, backing 

up, not taking her eyes off Mac --


MAC

Suzie... No.


SUZIE

It's you. You and your father.


MAC

No --


SUZIE

You brought us here. And that morning 

I found you in the barn. You had 

scratches on your face --


MAC

Listen to me --


SUZIE

You sabotaged the bus! You kept us 

here... To die! First Keith, then 

Carl --


MAC

Suzie --


She raises the scythe, about to strike --


And then -- The harvester starts up again. Suzie doesn't 

know what to do. She doesn't have to think too long. The 

next moment --


CRASH! The WALL of the BARN cracks. The HARVESTER is ploughing 

right into the BARN!!


MAC

Suzie, Come on!


They rush to the Barn Door. It's LOCKED from the outside!


They're trapped!


CRASH! The HARVESTER, headlights blazing, is chewing wood, 

coming through the wall --


MAC

This way!


Mac's pulled open the basement trapdoor. Suzie's terrified.


MAC

Trust me! -- Now!


Mac grabs one of the burning kerosene lamps. Just as they 

climb down the ladder --


CRASH! The HARVESTER has entered the barn, wood flying 

everywhere --


INT. SECRET BASEMENT (BARN) - MOMENTS LATER


MAC and SUZIE are now down under the barn. Mac slides the 

bolt on the trap door, locking them down there.


At least they're safe for the moment.


But...


The silhouettes of "Keith" and "Carl" , still there, cast 

weird shadows on the walls.


SUZIE

No Mac, please... I --


MAC

Don't look.


Above them, they can HEAR the HARVESTER -- being turned off.


Silence.


MAC shines the kerosene light around. And then --


THE TRAP DOOR... starts shaking. Someone's trying to pull it 

open. The padlock seems to hold.


But then -- THE HIGH-PITCHED WHINE of a power-driven CHAINSAW.


The TRAP DOOR rattles -- and a CHAINSAW BLADE jabs through.


Someone... or something... is CUTTING through the trap door 

to get to them!


The blade of the chainsaw is carving the trap door into 

pieces.


SUZIE

Mac!!!!


A section of the trapdoor falls in. Suzie's transfixed by 

the macabre figure of the scarecrow she can see in the gap.


Mac has found a LARGE HOLE in the wall behind a series of 

PIPES. Big enough to fit through. There's no other option. 

The only way out.


MAC

Over here! Hurry!


Mac grabs Suzie... and together, they climb through the hole, 

into --


INT. UNDERGROUND TUNNEL - CONTINUOUS


Dank and strange... there's puddles everywhere, dripping 

from the irrigation pipes. Blood streaks the wall.


It's not a place you'd want to be.


They cast a glance over their shoulders. Is someone following 

them? They can hear loud hammering -- perhaps someone shouting 

"Mac" like a wounded animal.


They move faster... as the tunnel twists and turns.


-- Finally coming to: A BOLTED DOOR. They unbolt the door. 

Mac holds the kerosene lamp high, REVEALING they're now in --


INT. AN OLD CAVE/SHACK - NIGHT - CONTINUOUS


An old stone shack built over the mouth of a natural cavern. 

The pipes on the cave roof feed up through the roof into the 

irrigation system.


We're obviously in the scarecrow's domain.


Mac bolts the door behind them. Suzie looks around.


SUZIE

Jesus.


There's some beat up old-style furniture... a pile of straw 

that could be a bed. A bottle of moonshine.


Hanging up are strange totems and talismans made of corn 

husks. Other objects hard to see in the shadows.


Something about it bespeaks insanity.


There are objects on an old table: souvenirs from all the 

murders.


Keith's shoes. Jesse's straw dolls.


Mac notices a KNIFE. A weapon.


He examines it... runs a finger along the bloodied edge...


SUZIE

Mac... let's get out of here.


MAC

Don't you see? Whatever's going on... 

I'm part of it.


Mac sees... the old MUSIC BOX. He opens it up.


SUZIE

Mac --


And for the first time, we see inside it.


A circle of hand-carved figures of FARM ANIMALS, cow, pig, 

horse... in a circle. In the center... is an empty slot.


Something is missing.


MAC

Get out of here.


SUZIE

No. Not without you --


He reaches in his pocket, takes out the wooden scarecrow 

figure... and clicks it into place.


The music box begins to play.


...an eerie rendition of "Old MacDonald Had a Farm". As it 

does, the carved "animals" weirdly revolve... around the 

main figure. Mac can't take his eyes off it.


SUZIE

Mac...?


And then...


AT THE MOUTH OF THE CAVE


a MAN, silhouetted by woods and moonlight appears.


It's Jeremiah. Unarmed. He stares at them, a strange look on 

his face.


MAC

Jeremiah?


JEREMIAH sees the music box in Suzie's hands -- and takes a 

step toward her. Mac just stands there.


Suzie freaks, grabs the KNIFE off the table in front of Mac.


SUZIE

(raising her kitchen 

knife)

K-Keep away...


Jeremiah moves closer -- and closer. Suzie holds her knife 

out.


JEREMIAH

Give me that --


SUZIE

I said, stay back!


Jeremiah lunges. As Suzie's about to strike, MAC GRABS her 

wrist, taking the knife away.


MAC

No!


Jeremiah reaches out... taking the music box from Suzie.


Jeremiah looks up, pleased. As if waiting for something.


The music box winds down, stopping.


And then... from outside... the sound of footsteps.


Someone else walks into the room.


The Scarecrow.


...Burlap stitched mask, overalls, gloves.


And in his right hand -- a familiar axe.


He looks at Mac and Suzie... then Jeremiah.


Mac and Suzie stare, with a mixture of horror and amazement.


The Scarecrow... takes one menacing step forward.


And then --


JEREMIAH

You see? They're here. I didn't mess 

up. Did I...


Beat.


JEREMIAH

...daddy.


SUZIE

(incredulous)

..."Daddy"?


MAC

(softly; to himself)

Oh my God... Jethro.


Jethro takes another menacing step towards them. The real 

Old Macdonald.


MAC

The trap door. That's how he escaped 

the fire...


SUZIE

(amazed; to Jeremiah)

You've been... hiding him all these 

years. Helping him... irrigate the 

land. With blood...


JEREMIAH

Well, you know what they say... To 

make a good omlette... you got to 

break a few eggs.


Jethro's hands tighten around the axe.


AND -- THWAK!


JETHRO brings down the AXE, embedding it not in Mac -- but 

in an old wooden table in front of him. On the handle he can 

see: "Jethro Macdonald".


A silent communication passes from Jethro to Jeremiah.


JEREMIAH

(to Mac)

You know what to do.


Jeremiah gives a slight nod toward SUZIE: The intent is clear: 

kill her.


JEREMIAH

It's time to make amends.


MAC

(weakly)

Amends...?


JEREMIAH

Think boy. That night. The night of 

the fire. At the barn. You were only 

six years old.


MAC

I --


Mac tries to think. Then --


FLASH IMAGE


FIRE... everywhere. In the barn --


JEREMIAH

You were there!!!


Mac struggles to remember. He's torn, conflicted --


Then -- suddenly --


QUICK FLASH IMAGE - MEMORY - FROM SCENE ONE


Young Mac... hiding in the barn.


The Music Box.


JETHRO in the shadows.


But now... we reveal other things:


BLOOD... drip, drip, dripping. From Jethro's contraption 

pushing through pipes and plastic sacs.


FLASH IMAGE:


Several dead bodies nearby. Murdered FARMHANDS and TRANSIENTS. 

Prepared for Jethro's blood harvest and attached to his 

machine.


JEREMIAH (O.S.)

That's right. You were there.


Then another series of IMAGES flood through Mac's memory:


As young six year-old MAC tries to get away, his ankle is 

GRABBED by Jethro.


Terrified, trying to escape, young Mac reaches out -- grabs 

the LANTERN and throws it at Jethro.


It explodes, engulfing Jethro in flames... turning him into 

a human fireball. Mac scrambles away --


BACK TO:


INT. CAVE/SHACK - NIGHT (PRESENT DAY)


Mac's stunned, dazed, finally remembering everything.


MAC

I... started the fire.


Jethro pulls off a glove. His hand is horribly burned. We 

can only imagine what his face must look like.


JEREMIAH

-- But it's alright, boy!

(indicating Jethro)

He forgives you. Isn't that right, 

Daddy?


Jethro grabs Mac's hand, puts it on the axe handle.


And then... with a rasping, evil voice --


JETHRO

Pick it up.


Mac looks at his "family". Sees eagerness.


Mac looks at Suzie. Sees cold fear.


JEREMIAH

If you don't do it... he will!


Mac hesitates.


Mac reaches out, touching the handle. He feels the wood... 

almost caressing it. Maybe he's a Macdonald after all.  


JEREMIAH

That's right.


Mac makes his decision. He can't help himself. He steps 

towards Suzie. Her eyes grow wide with terror. He tenderly 

touches her hair. His hand moves around to the back of her 

neck. Pure tenderness.


And then --


-- Suzie sees the KNIFE in Mac's other hand.


SUZIE

(terrified)

...no... Mac... p-please...


MAC

Can't help it, Suze... family sticks 

together...


Locking eyes with Suzie... Mac PLUNGES the knife into her 

abdomen.


In total disbelief, Suzie looks down... at the knife. The 

blood. Her hands encircle his, feeling the knife handle.


...and then, she looks back into Mac's eyes. They stare at 

each other...


...as Mac continues to pull the KNIFE up... up... gutting 

her.


Blood seeps through her clothing.


Suzie's eyes glaze over... almost as if she's accepting her 

fate.


Mac lowers her to the ground... dead, never taking his eyes 

off her.


He pulls the knife out, releasing Suzie's lifeless body.


Mac stands up, faces Jeremiah and Jethro. If you could see 

through the scarred tissue, you might see a smile on Jethro's 

lips.


Mac, almost in a trance, walks over to the wooden table.


He picks up an open bottle of MOONSHINE.


Mac takes a huge swig to steady his nerves.


JETHRO

Welcome home, boy.


Mac puts down the bottle of moonshine, wipes his mouth.


Beat.


He turns towards Jeremiah and Jethro --


MAC

Actually... I was just yankin' your 

chain...


Mac holds up the knife. With a slight grin, he pushes down 

on the retractable blade. It's the fake knife from the opening 

sequence. Kept as a souvenir by Jethro.


Then --


VOICE

Hey old Macdonald...


Jeremiah and Jethro turn... to see...


SUZIE.


A long line of fake blood down her chest. Lantern in her 

hand.


MAC SWINGS the bottle of MOONSHINE, SMASHING it against the 

side of Jethro's face --


SUZIE

...you just bought the farm.


SUZIE HURLS THE LANTERN


-- it hits the moonshine-soaked straw and WHOOSH!


Jethro EXPLODES into flames, covering his entire body.


He emits a weird, strangled cry... the only sound we've heard 

him make --


JEREMIAH

Daddeeeeeeee!


Frantic, a dutiful son til the end, Jeremiah tries to help 

his father, putting out the flames, ignoring the fire that 

burns his own hands and face --


MAC

(softly)

Ei, ei... oh.


Mac grabs Suzie's hand and they make a run for the cave 

entrance. They look back to see --


JEREMIAH grappling with JETHRO, trying to extinguish his 

flames.


Jeremiah catches fire also, both of them caught in a raging 

inferno --


EXT. CAVE ENTRANCE - NIGHT - MOMENTS LATER


As smoke and fire pours out of the cave/shack... Suzie 

stumbles out, helping Mac. They're a mess. Coughing, bloody, 

exhausted.


And then --


The fire reaches the old MOONSHINE STILL. It explodes, sending 

flames and debris shooting into the air.


Mac and Suzie, helping each other, stumble out of the way.


They collapse on the ground, dazed... but alive.


SUZIE

I almost thought for a second...


MAC

Never.


He holds her tight.


As we PULL BACK slowly, they look back at the raging inferno 

inside the cave.


Around them, reflections of RED and BLUE LIGHTS now --


The SHERIFF is on the scene. An AMBULANCE as well.


Candy has made it alive. Wrapped in a blanket she watches as 

a couple of PARAMEDICS rush to help Mac and Suzie.


ROD dazed, bleeding, but happy to see them -- and happy to 

be alive. He's brought the calvary. In addition to Candy, 

standing next to Rod is... ORWELL, alternator girl, watching 

in amazement. She watches the fire and paramedics... better 

than MTV.


ORWELL

I'd give anything to be in a rock 

band.


ROD just looks at her, entranced


EXT. CONCERT HALL - MAGIC HOUR


Several months later. Throngs of people, enjoying the music. 

A big stage. And on it -- Dead Quiet are back in business, 

like true rock 'n roll survivors. They're a leaner, meaner, 

tighter band now -- their experience on the farm has given 

them a tight edge they lacked before. It's the edge that 

goes with stardom.


MAC is at the mike, singing his heart out once again.


SUZIE is still pumping the bass, alive with energy and 

passion. She looks at MAC. They smile at each other.


There's a new guy on drums, taking the place of IAN. No 

keyboard player. But someone else seems to be missing. As 

the song moves into a bridge, Mac looks off-stage --


MAC

Where's Rod?


He's talking to ORWELL, who's now officially part of the 

family.


MAC

Find him. Now!


EXT. BACKSTAGE - SAME TIME


Rod's standing in a backstage area, looking clean, sober, 

and ready to rock. With him, straightening out his costume, 

is Candy.


Rod is signing a COMPACT DISC of his new album for a WOMAN 

with a notebook in her hand, and a PRESS PASS pinned to her 

tee-shirt --


PRESS WOMAN

One last question -- how long did it 

take you to write the songs for "Old 

Macdonald's Farm"?


ROD

(counting on his 

fingers)

Well, after Mac and Billy Bob got 

out of the hospital, and I got out 

of rehab --


CANDY

Four weeks! That's all. And now their 

CD's number ten this week. With a 

bullet.


Candy kisses Rod, just as a PHOTOGRAPHER snaps a photo.


FLASH! The picture FREEZE-FRAMES... turning into a black and 

white still. We hear "Dead Quiet's" latest Indie rock hit 

fade through. And in black and white, like a music video, we --


CUT TO:


FAMILIAR WOODEN SIGN


...which reads: "Macdonald's Farm".


That's because we're back at --


EXT. MACDONALD FARM - NIGHT (SAME TIME)


A REAL ESTATE AGENT, his rental car parked nearby the 

entrance, is hammering another sign: "Property For Sale."


Using a rock, he whacks the sign into the soil.


Suddenly, HEADLIGHTS illuminate him. He turns to look, 

squinting, shielding his eyes, trying to see the driver --


REAL ESTATE AGENT

Hi. Can I help you?


INT. BACKSTAGE AREA (CONCERT HALL) - SAME TIME


ORWELL

Hey, Rod --


ROD

Hey baby.


A slight flicker of jealousy from Candy. Rod always gets the 

babes.


ORWELL

Mac wants us on stage. In a hurry.


ROD

I'm coming.


Rod gets ready to go on. Candy picks up his new guitar --


CANDY

Hey, honey. Don't forget your axe.


EXT. MACDONALD FARM - SAME TIME


An AXE. A real one.


...going into the chest of the Real Estate Agent. He sinks 

to his knees, dying.


EXT. CONCERT HALL (STAGE) - SAME TIME


Rod, guitar held high, strides on stage to tumultuous 

applause. ORWELL follows him, taking her place behind the 

organ. She's in the band now, too. Keyboards.


Rod winks at Candy, watching from the wings.


Suzie is amused, at the slight jealousy between Candy and 

Orwell.


As Rod launches into a blistering guitar solo, Mac & Suzie 

share a moment.


For Dead Quiet, business -- and life... has never been better.


EXT. FARM - SAME TIME


The dead body of the Real Estate Agent is lowered into the 

back of an old PICK-UP TRUCK.


Then the AXE -- with the initials "J. Macdonald." carved on 

it -- is put back in the mahogany case.


We PULL BACK TO REVEAL --


Jeremiah Macdonald. Alive and well.


Sort of.


He's survived the fire. But... like his father, his face is 

horribly burned and scarred. He's wearing overalls and gloves.


In the back of the truck is an assortment of deadly FARM 

IMPLEMENTS... scythes, knives, etc... and the music box... 

slightly blackened from the fire. JEREMIAH slots the small 

carved figure into place. The music of "Old MacDonald" mixes 

with the indie rock DEAD QUIET track.


He pauses to look at the surrounding cornfields. They could 

use a little... nourishment.


JEREMIAH

Well Daddy... it's harvest time.


Jeremiah puts on the SCARECROW mask. He then reaches down... 

and uproots the "For Sale" sign, tossing it away.


Jeremiah starts up the truck,... ready to carry on the family 

tradition.


It is indeed, harvest time.


HOLD on the PICK-UP... as it pulls away, traveling down the 

dirt road... and into the farmland night.


Let's leave him there...


For now.


THE END
