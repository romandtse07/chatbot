"THE PRODUCERS"


by


Mel Brooks


Final Draft


March, 1967




INT. DAY. HALLWAY OUTSIDE OF MAX BIALYSTOCK'S OFFICE.


CLOSE-UP OF LITTLE OLD LADY. She blows a kiss and waves good-

bye.


CUT TO CLOSE-UP OF MAX BIALYSTOCK. He responds with similar 

gestures.


CAMERA PULLS BACK TO FULL SHOT. Legend on frosted glass of 

Bialystock's office door reads:


MAX BIALYSTOCK - THEATRICAL PRODUCER


Little old lady begins to descend stairway. She stops, turns, 

blows another kiss and once more waves goodbye. Bialystock 

graciously answers in kind.


BIALYSTOCK

Don't forget the checkee. Can't 

produce playees without checkees.


LITTLE OLD LADY

You can count on me-o, you dirty 

young man.


CAMERA BACK TO BIALYSTOCK'S FACE FROZEN IN A LITTLE GOODBYE 

SMILE. The little old lady's footsteps. Begin to fade.


Bialystock's face quickly resumes its normal expression -- 


Despair and disgust. He then reaches into his vest pocket, 

pulls out an old-fashioned, pocket watch and earnestly 

consults its face.


CAMERA STAYS WITH HIM AS HE RUSHES INTO HIS OFFICE. Bialystock 

moves with a quick shuffling gait to his desk. From the top 

of it he picks up a framed photograph.


CAMERA INSERT: CLOSE-UP OF PHOTOGRAPH. It is face of little 

old lady who has just left.


CAMERA BACK TO BIALYSTOCK. He opens desk drawer. It is filled 

with tagged keys. He picks up a key.


CAMERA INSERT: tag on key reads: Investors file.


CAMERA BACK TO BIALYSTOCK. With photograph in hand, he moves 

across his office to a large, double-doored cabinet. He 

unlocks cabinet.


CAMERA SHOWS CABINET INTERIOR FILLED WITH HUNDREDS OF 

SIMILARLY FRAMED PHOTOGRAPHS OF LITTLE OLD LADIES.


CAMERA BACK TO BIALYSTOCK. He places photograph in its proper 

niche and begins to look through the faces.


CAMERA SLOWLY PANS ROWS OF PHOTOGRAPHS, BIALYSTOCK'S P.O.V.


BIALYSTOCK

(Voice Over)

"Hold me, touch me', 'hold me, touch 

me', 'hold me, touch me', where is 

'hold me, touch me'? Ahhh... here we 

are. 'Hold me, touch me.'"


CAMERA STOPS PANNING AND REMAINS ON ONE OF THE PHOTOGRAPHS. 

Bialystock's hand moves into the frame and picks up 

photograph.


CAMERA MOVES IN TO CLOSE-UP OF PHOTOGRAPH.


DISSOLVE THROUGH TO MATCHING CLOSE-UP OF SAME FACE WE HAVE 

JUST SEEN IN PHOTOGRAPH.


CAMERA PULLS BACK TO REVEAL LITTLE OLD LADY IN REAR SEAT OF 

LIMOUSINE. EXTERIOR. DAY.


CAMERA KEEPS MOVING BACK TO EXTERIOR OF LIMO AS IT MOVES 

ALONG THROUGH NEW YORK'S THEATRICAL DISTRICT.


LONG SHOT. 45Th street. Same limousine pulls up in front of 

one of the theatres that line the block.


MEDIUM SHOT. Chauffeur briskly hops out, and smartly opens 

rear door. The little old lady emerges. She lowers her veil 

and furtively ducks into the building entrance.


INT. MEDIUM SHOT. DILAPIDATED THEATRE OFFICE BUILDING.


The little old lady enters. She raises her veil, chuckles 

gleefully, and begins to ascend the stairs.


MEDIUM SHOT. Upon reaching the landing, she spots the first 

little old lady coming down. She quickly drops her veil. The 

first little old lady discreetly hides her face with her 

purse as they pass each other on the landing.


DISSOLVE TO FOURTH FLOOR LANDING. The little old lady makes 

her way to the top. She hangs onto the banister for support 

as she catches her breath. She raises her veil, reaches into 

her purse, takes out a small flacon of perfume and sprays 

delicately behind both ears. Thoroughly composed, she 

approaches Bialystock's door. She raps on the door three 

times in quick succession, waits a moment, raps twice and 

then three times again. Suddenly the door is flung open.


MEDIUM SHOT. MAX BIALYSTOCK


BIALYSTOCK

(leering)

Darling!


MEDIUM SHOT OVER BIALYSTOCK'S SHOULDER. LITTLE OLD LADY.


LITTLE OLD LADY

(passionately)

Hold me, touch me.


CUT TO TWO SHOT. Bialystock clutches the little old lady in 

a passionate embrace.


BIALYSTOCK

Devil woman.


Freeze action.


SUPER-IMPOSE FIRST CREDIT: ZERO MOSTEL.


Resume action.


The little old lady giggles joyously and then slips from 

Bialystock's grasp, darts into the office and ducks behind 

the couch. She pops her head up.


LITTLE OLD LADY

Finder's keepers.


Freeze action.


SUPER-IMPOSE: TITLE OF FILM


Resume action.


BIALYSTOCK

Here I come, ready or not.


Bialystock leaps through the air towards the couch.


Freeze-action.


CREDIT.


Resume action.


Bialystock lands badly. He writhes in pain. Little old lady 

coquettishly crawls to him.


LITTLE OLD LADY

What's the matter? Papa no want to 

play with baby?


BIALYSTOCK

Ohhhhhh.


Freeze-action.


CREDIT.


Resume action.


Bialystock reaches out for her. She eludes him, darts into a 

chair, crosses her leg seductively, raises her skirt just 

above her knee revealing a golden rose and garter.


Freeze-action.


CREDIT.


Resume action.


Bialystock struggles to his feet.


BIALYSTOCK

Come to Papa. Come to Papa do.


Little old lady leaps out of her chair and poses, coyly.


LITTLE OLD LADY

To the victor go the spoils.


Bialystock starts for her. She rushes around a chair and 

ducks behind it. Bialystock tiptoes on to chair and peeks 

over it.


BIALYSTOCK

I'm gonna get you.


Freeze-action.


CREDIT.


Resume action.


Cut to little old lady wedged between desk and back of chair. 

She straightens her legs and sends the chair hurtling across 

the room.


CLOSE-UP OF BIALYSTOCK'S FACE: TERROR.


Freeze-action.


CREDIT.


Resume action.


Bialystock crashes into radiator.


BIALYSTOCK

Ohhhhhhhh.


Cut to little old lady. She is lying phone on the desk, 

preening herself and purring.


LITTLE OLD LADY

Meeow. Meeow. I wonder where Old Tom 

is tonight? Meeow.


Bialystock, with great will, pushes the hate out of his face 

and replaces it with sweetness.


BIALYSTOCK

Rowrrr.


Bialystock glides in tom-cat fashion over to his preening 

pussy-cat.


Freeze-action.


CREDIT.


Resume action.


Bialystock finishes crossing to desk, puts his face down 

near hers and softly mews into her ear. She suddenly lets 

out a fierce howl as she rebuffs him with a savage swipe of 

her "paw". Bialystock grabs his stricken face with both hands 

and shrieks.


BIALYSTOCK

Aieeeeyiyiyiyiyi,


CLOSE-UP OF BIALYSTOCK'S PAIN-RIDDEN FEATURES.


Stop action.


CREDIT.


Resume action.


Bialystock falls into the chair moaning. She hops on to his 

lap. From his breast pocket she takes a handkerchief and 

tenderly dabs his cheek with it.


LITTLE OLD LADY

Oh, Bialy, Bialy, darling, did I 

hurt you?


Freeze-action.


CREDIT.


Resume action.


BIALYSTOCK

My hand. My hand. I can't turn my 

hand.

(he turns his hand)


There is a rapping at the door. We hear it, they don't.


LITTLE OLD LADY

(taking his hand)

Don't worry. I'll kiss it and make 

it well.

(she smothers his 

hand with kissers)


BIALYSTOCK

(trying to rescue his 

hand)

Enough. It's better. Please, Lambchop, 

it's better. Stop. You're hurting it 

again.


Cut to door. It opens. Leo Bloom enters.


BLOOM

(his forward motion 

arrested by the 

unbelievable scene)

How do you do. I mean... Excuse me... 

I mean...


BIALYSTOCK

You mean ooops, don't you? Say ooops 

and get out.


BLOOM

I'll wait in the hall...


BIALYSTOCK

Oooooooops!


BLOOM

(backing out of door)

Ooooooops.


Little old lady hops off Bialystock's lap and goes to door.


LITTLE OLD LADY

I can't abide a peeping Tom. There's 

one in the apartment just opposite 

my bedroom window. I swear that man 

NEVER takes his field glasses off me 

for a minute.


She locks door and starts back toward Bialystock.


LITTLE OLD LADY

Feeling better?


Bialystock nods his head in assent.


LITTLE OLD LADY

Good. Let's fool around. Now, I'll 

be the innocent little milk maid and 

you'll be the naughty stable boy.

(she goes into her 

act)

Oh, this milk is so heavy. I'll never 

reach the house. Help. Will someone 

help me?


BIALYSTOCK

(stopping her)

Wait. Wait. We can't play today. I 

have too many appointments.


LITTLE OLD LADY

(crushed)

We can't play today?


BIALYSTOCK

Thursday. Thursday. We'll play 

Thursday. We'll play the Contessa 

and the chauffeur.


LITTLE OLD LADY

Oh, the best one.


BIALYSTOCK

(trying to steer her 

towards the door)

Until Thursday, then, Contessa Mio.


LITTLE OLD LADY

(she sits on the sofa)

Oh, Bialy, please, just a little.  

Just a little.


BIALYSTOCK

(harassed)

All right. All right.


He squats down in front of her in chauffeur fashion, his 

hands on the wheel.


LITTLE OLD LADY

So, the Count hired you this morning, 

Rudolfo... Watch the road... Watch 

the road.


BIALYSTOCK

I can't take my eyes off you. How 

can I drive when you drive me mad.  

Mad.


LITTLE OLD LADY

(she squeals with 

delight)

Rudolfo, you dirty pig! Pull over.


BIALYSTOCK

(upright)

Good. That's enough. We'll do the 

rest on Thursday.

(he reaches down and 

helps her off the 

couch)

That's a good girl.

(leading her to the 

door)

It's always such fun to see you.


Bialystock opens the door and ushers her out onto the landing.


CUT TO HALLWAY. FAR SHOT. Revealing Bloom waiting outside. 

We see him. They do not. Bloom, very embarrassed, hugs the 

wall trying to make himself less conspicuous.


MEDIUM SHOT. Bialystock and the old lady in front of 

Bialystock's door.


BIALYSTOCK

Until Thursday, then, you bawdy wench.


He slaps her on the rump.


LITTLE OLD LADY

Oooh. I love it. Hold me, touch me.


CUT TO BLOOM IN SHADOWS, AGHAST.


BACK TO MEDIUM SHOT LITTLE OLD LADY AND BIALYSTOCK.


BIALYSTOCK

Thursday. I'll see you Thursday.


LITTLE OLD LADY

And we'll finish playing the Contessa 

and Rudolfo.


BIALYSTOCK

Good. Yes. Thursday.


LITTLE OLD LADY

And after that we'll play the 

Abduction and cruel rape of 

Lucretia... And I'll play Lucretia.


CUT TO BLOOM IN SHADOWS. It is all too much for him. He looks 

the other way. Suddenly his eyes widen in surprise, as he 

discovers another man hiding in the next doorway. The man 

puts a finger to his lips indicating silence. There is no 

place left for Bloom to look. He looks to heaven.


BACK TO LITTLE OLD LADY AND BIALYSTOCK.


LITTLE OLD LADY

Oh, Thursday. Will Thursday ever 

come?


BIALYSTOCK

(to himself)

Like clockwork.


She starts to descend.


LITTLE OLD LADY

I shall count the minutes.


BIALYSTOCK

Goodbye, my angel... My angel!

(calling after her)

Hey, touch me... wait! Hey, uh...  

Lucretia, Lucretia!


We hear a mounting clatter of footsteps as the little old 

lady flies back up the stairs.


LITTLE OLD LADY

(eagerly)

Yes???


BIALYSTOCK

Oh, Angelcake, you forgot to give me 

the check. Can't produce a play 

without money, ha, ha, ha.


CUT TO BLOOM. Once more he steals a glance at the stranger 

hidden in the second doorway. Once again the man gestures 

for him to be silent.


CUT BACK TO BIALYSTOCK AND THE OLD LADY.


LITTLE OLD LADY

(opening her handbag 

and reaching inside)

Of course, the check, I had it with 

me all the time.


She takes out the check and hands it to him.


LITTLE OLD LADY

I don't know what's happening to me.  

I must be getting old.


Bialystock takes check and reads it.


LITTLE OLD LADY

Is it all right? I made it out to 

cash. You didn't tell me the name of 

the play.


BIALYSTOCK

Oh, it's fine. Fine. Good. Good. 

Bye. Bye.


LITTLE OLD LADY

Til Thursday, my Darling, I shall 

count the minutes.


She starts to descend.


LITTLE OLD LADY

(descending)

Ta. Ta.


BIALYSTOCK

(waving check at her)

Ta. Ta.


The man, who has been lurking in the second doorway, suddenly 

springs into action. He darts forward and quickly takes the 

check out of Bialystock's hand.


THE MAN (LANDLORD)

He who signs a lease, must pay rent.


He shoves the check into his pocket and starts down the 

stairs.


LANDLORD

That's the law.


BIALYSTOCK

Murderer! Thief! How can you take 

the last penny out of a man's pocket?


LANDLORD

(turns back, shrugs)

I have to... I'm a landlord!


BIALYSTOCK

(shouting to heaven)

Oh Lord, hear my plea. Destroy him.  

He maketh a blight on the land.


CUT TO LANDLORD ON THE WAY DOWN.


LANDLORD

(to the Lord)

Don't pay attention. He's crazy.


CUT BACK TO BIALYSTOCK. He turns to re-enter his office.


BIALYSTOCK

(biting his knuckle)

Nnnnn. That hurt.

(he sighs)

I'll have to make another call.


He starts in and stops. He notices Bloom.


BIALYSTOCK

(to Bloom, quietly)

Have you been there all this time?


Bloom nods.


BIALYSTOCK

And did you see and hear everything?


Bloom nods.


BIALYSTOCK

Then what do you have to say for 

yourself?


BLOOM

Uh... uh... ooooooops?


BIALYSTOCK

(shouts)

Who are you? What do you want? Why 

are you loitering in my hallway? 

Speak, dummy, speak! Why don't you 

speak?


BLOOM

Scared. Can't talk.


BIALYSTOCK

All right. Get a hold of yourself.  

Take a deep breath, let it out slowly 

and tell me who you are.


BLOOM

(breathes deeply.  

Words tumble from 

his mouth as he 

exhales)

I'm Leo Bloom, I'm an accountant, 

I'm from Whitehall and Marks, I was 

sent here to do your books and I'm 

terribly sorry I caught you with the 

old lady.

(he has run out of 

breath)


BIALYSTOCK

"Caught you with the old lady." Come 

in, Mr. Tact.


CUT TO OFFICE. They enter. Bloom enters timorously. He doesn't 

know quite where to go. He looks to Bialystock for guidance.  

Bialystock studies Bloom curiously from head to toe.


BIALYSTOCK

So you're an accountant, eh?


BLOOM

(timidly)

Yes sir.


BIALYSTOCK

Then account for yourself! Do you 

believe in God? Do you believe in 

gold? Why are you looking up old 

lady's dresses? Bit of a pervert, 

eh?


Bloom, who has been quaking under the assault, reaches into 

his pocket and takes out the tattered corner of an old blue 

baby blanket. He twists the blue blanket nervously in his 

hands.


BLOOM

Sir, I...


BIALYSTOCK

Never mind. Never mind. Do the books. 

They're in that desk over there. Top 

drawer.


Bloom dutifully goes to desk. Opens top drawer and begins 

removing books.


BIALYSTOCK

How dare you condemn me without 

knowing all the facts.


BLOOM

But sir, I'm not condem...


BIALYSTOCK

Shut up. I'm having a rhetorical 

conversation.

(to himself)

How humiliating. Max Bialystock. Max 

Bialystock.


Bialystock suddenly wheels and shouts at Bloom.


BIALYSTOCK

You know who I used to be? Max 

Bialystock! The King of Broadway! 

Six shows running at once. Lunch at 

Delmonico's. Two hundred dollar suits. 

Look at me. Look at me now! I'm 

wearing a cardboard belt!


He rips the belt off and holds it in the air.


BIALYSTOCK

I used to have thousands of investors 

begging, pleading, to put their money 

into a Max Bialystock production.


He picks up the picture on desk ('hold me, touch me') takes 

it over to open cabinet filled with similar pictures.


BIALYSTOCK

Look at my investors now. Voila!

(gestures at pictures)

Hundreds of little old ladies stopping 

off at Max Bialystock's office to 

grab a last thrill on the way to the 

cemetery.


He puts picture back in its place. Looks toward Bloom.


CUT TO BLOOM. He is obviously touched by the great man's 

dilemma.


CUT TO BIALYSTOCK.


BIALYSTOCK

You have exactly ten seconds to change 

that disgusting look of pity into 

one of enormous respect. One... Two...


CUT TO BLOOM. He is really trying to change his expression.


CUT TO BIALYSTOCK.


BIALYSTOCK

Do the books! Do the books!


CUT TO BLOOM. He is greatly relieved.


BLOOM

(sighing)

Yes, sir. Thank you.


He plunges into his work.


CUT TO BIALYSTOCK. He goes to window, looks out.


BIALYSTOCK

(to himself)

Window's so filthy, can't tell if 

it's day or night out there.


He wipes window with his cuff. Looks at window. No good. 

Looks at his grimy cuff. Grimaces. From his desk he takes 

the remains of a cardboard container of coffee and sloshes 

it against the window. He wipes with his tie. He looks over 

his shoulder at Bloom to see if he is watching. Bloom is 

watching. Their eyes meet. Bloom's eyes retreat. Bialystock 

victoriously turns away and looks out the window down into 

the street.


CAMERA: SHOT OF STREET. BIALYSTOCK'S POINT OF VIEW. A white 

Rolls Royce slowly makes its way up the block.


BIALYSTOCK

(voice over as camera 

follows Rolls)

Look at that. A white Rolls Royce.  

That's it baby, when you got it, 

flaunt it.


BLOOM

(off screen)

Koff, koff... ahem, ahem... 

harrumph...


BIALYSTOCK

I assume you are making those cartoon 

noises to attract my attention. Am I 

correct in my assumption, you fish-

faced enemy of the people?


Bloom is wounded.


BIALYSTOCK

I have hurt your feelings.


Bloom nods.


BIALYSTOCK

Good, what is it?


BLOOM

Sir, may I speak to you for a minute?


BIALYSTOCK

(looking at his watch)

Go! You have fifty-eight seconds.


BLOOM

Well, sir, it seems...


BIALYSTOCK

(interrupting)

You have forty-eight seconds left.  

Hurry. Hurry.


BLOOM

(speedily)

In looking at your books, I've 

discovered that...


BIALYSTOCK

(interrupting)

Twenty-eight seconds, hurry, hurry, 

you're using up your time.


In his anxiety, Bloom unconsciously reaches into his pocket 

takes out the old blue blanket and nervously strokes his 

cheek with it.


BLOOM

Mr. Bialystock, I cannot function 

under these conditions.


Bialystock curiously eyes the blanket.


BLOOM

You're making me extremely nervous.


BIALYSTOCK

What is that? A handkerchief?


Bloom quickly begins to put away his blue blanket.


BLOOM

It's nothing... nothing.


Quick as a flash, Bialystock reaches over and snatches it 

out of Bloom's hand.


BIALYSTOCK

If it's nothing, why can't I see it?


Bloom leaps up in hot pursuit of his blanket.


BLOOM

(shrieking in panic)

My blanket. Give me my blue blanket.


Bialystock, taken aback, hurriedly gives the blanket back to 

Bloom.


BIALYSTOCK

Here, don't panic.


BLOOM

(clutching his blanket)

I'm sorry... I don't like people 

touching my blue blanket. It's not 

important. It's a minor compulsion.  

I can deal with it if I want to. 

It's just that I've had it ever since 

I was a baby and... and... I find it 

very comforting.


He kisses it and shoves it into his pocket.


BIALYSTOCK

(to himself)

They come here. They all come here.  

How do they find me?


BLOOM

(recovering his dignity)

Mr. Bialystock...


BIALYSTOCK

Yes, Prince Mishkin, what can we do 

for you?


BLOOM

This is hardly a time for levity.  

I've discovered a serious error here 

in the accounts of your last play.


Bialystock moves around the desk to examine the ledger.


BIALYSTOCK

Where? What?


BLOOM

According to the backer's list you 

raised $60,000. But the show you 

produced only cost fifty-eight 

thousand. There's two thousand dollars 

unaccounted for.


BIALYSTOCK

I went to a Turkish bath, who cares?  

The show was a flop. What difference 

does it make?


BLOOM

It makes a great deal of difference.  

That's fraud. If they found out, you 

could go to prison.


BIALYSTOCK

Why should they find out? It's only 

two thousand dollars, Bloom, do me a 

favor, move a few decimal points 

around. You can do it. You're an 

accountant. The word 'count' is part 

of your title.


BLOOM

(aghast)

But that's cheating!


BIALYSTOCK

It's not cheating... It's charity.  

Bloom, look at me... look at me!  

I'm drowning. Other men sail through 

life. Bialystock has struck a reef. 

Bloom, I'm going under. I am being 

sunk by a society that demands 

success, when all I can offer is 

failure. Bloom, I'm reaching out to 

you. Don't send me to jail. Help! 

Help!


During Bialystock's last speech, Bloom unconsciously reaches 

into his pocket, takes out the blue blanket and rubs it across 

his cheek.


BLOOM

Oh dear, oh dear, oh dear, oh dear.


BIALYSTOCK

(faintly)

Help!


BLOOM

All right. I'll do it. I'll do it.


BIALYSTOCK

Thank you, Bloom. I knew I could con 

you.


BLOOM

Oh, it's all right... wha?


BIALYSTOCK

Nothing. Nothing. Do it. Do it.


BLOOM

(pouring over the 

accounts)

Now let's see, two thousand dollars.  

That isn't much. I'm sure I can hide 

it somewhere. After all, the 

department of internal revenue isn't 

interested in a show that flopped.


BIALYSTOCK

Yes. Right. Good thinking. You figure 

it out. I'm tired. I'm gonna take a 

little nap.

(crossing to couch)

Wake me if there's a fire.


He hurls himself down onto the couch.


CAMERA MOVES IN TO TIGHT SHOT OF BLOOM.


BLOOM

Now let's see, if we add these 

figures, we get...


CAMERA MOVES INTO CLOSE-UP OF BLOOM'S FINGER SWIFTLY MOVING 

DOWN LONG COLUMN OF FIGURES. He comes to the end and 

immediately writhes total below.


BACK TO TIGHT SHOT OF BLOOM. He compares pages.


BLOOM

(musing to himself)

Heh, heh, heh, amazing. It's 

absolutely amazing. But under the 

right circumstances, a producer could 

make more money with a flop than he 

could with a hit.


QUICK CUT TO BIALYSTOCK'S SLEEPING FACE. His eyes pop open.


CUT BACK TO BLOOM.


BLOOM

Yes. Yes. It's quite possible. If he 

were certain the show would fail, a 

man could make a fortune.


CUT TO BIALYSTOCK. By now he is halfway across the room. His 

whole being tingling with alertness. He moves to Bloom's 

desk and hovers over him, waiting expectantly for more 

information. But Bloom is lost in his work, unaware that 

Bialystock is hanging on his every word.


BIALYSTOCK

Yes???


Bloom looks up. He is startled to see Bialystock's face so 

close to his own.


BLOOM

(at a loss)

Yes, what?


BIALYSTOCK

What you were saying. Keep talking.


BLOOM

What was I saying?


BIALYSTOCK

You were saying that under the right 

circumstances, a producer could make 

more money with a flop than he could 

with a hit.


BLOOM

(smiling)

Yes, it's quite possible.


BIALYSTOCK

You keep saying that, but you don't 

tell me how. How could a producer 

make more money with a flop than 

with a hit?


Bloom, slightly exasperated, puts his pencil down and faces 

Bialystock. He speaks to Bialystock as a teacher would a 

student.


BLOOM

It's simply a matter of creative 

accounting. Let us assume, just for 

the moment, that you are a dishonest 

man.


BIALYSTOCK

Assume away!


BLOOM

Well, it's very easy. You simply 

raise more money than you really 

need.


BIALYSTOCK

What do you mean?


BLOOM

You've done it yourself, only you 

did it on a very small scale.


BIALYSTOCK

What did I do?


BLOOM

You raised two thousand more than 

you needed to produce your last play.


BIALYSTOCK

So what? What did it get me? I'm 

wearing a cardboard belt.


BLOOM

Ahhhhhh! But that's where you made 

your error. You didn't go all the 

way. You see, if you were really a 

bold criminal, you could have raised 

a million.


BIALYSTOCK

But the play only cost $60,000 to 

produce.


BLOOM

Exactly. And how long did it run?


BIALYSTOCK

One night.


BLOOM

See? You could have raised a million 

dollars, put on a sixty thousand 

dollar flop and kept the rest.


BIALYSTOCK

But what if the play was a hit?


BLOOM

Oh, you'd go to jail. If the play 

were a hit, you'd have to pay off 

the backers, and with so many backers 

there could never be enough profits 

to go around, get it?


BIALYSTOCK

Aha, aha, aha, aha, aha, aha!! So, 

in order for the scheme to work, 

we'd have to find a sure fire flop.


BLOOM

What scheme?


BIALYSTOCK

What scheme? Your scheme, you bloody 

little genius.


BLOOM

Oh, no. No. No. I meant no scheme. I 

merely posed a little, academic 

accounting theory. It's just a 

thought.


BIALYSTOCK

Bloom, worlds are turned on such 

thoughts!


Bialystock starts moving in on Bloom.


BIALYSTOCK

Don't you see, Bloom. Darling, Bloom, 

glorious Bloom, it's so simple. Step 

one: We find the worst play in the 

world -- a sure flop. Step two: I 

raise a million dollars -- there's a 

lot of little old ladies in this 

world. Step three: You go back to 

work on the books. Phoney lists of 

backers -- one for the government, 

one for us. You can do it, Bloom, 

you're a wizard. Step four: We open 

on Broadway and before you can say 

'step five' we close on Broadway. 

Step six: We take our million dollars 

and fly to Rio de Janiero.


Bialystock grabs Bloom in his arms and begins to lead him in 

a wild tango around the room.


BIALYSTOCK

(sings)

"Ah, Rio, Rio by the seao, meo, myo, 

meo... "


BLOOM

(afraid of the scheme, 

afraid of the dance, 

afraid of Bialystock)

Mr. Bialystock. No. Wait. Please. 

You're holding me too tight. I'm an 

honest man. You don't understand.


BIALYSTOCK

(leading Bloom as he 

talks)

No, Bloom, you don't understand.  

This is fate, this is destiny.  

There's no avoiding it.


At this point, Bialystock sweeps Bloom into an elaborate 

dip.


BLOOM

(the back of his head 

practically touching 

the floor)

Mr. Bialystock, not more than five 

minutes ago, against my better 

judgment, I doctored your books. 

That, sir, is the ultimate extent of 

my criminal life.


Bialystock raises his fists to the heavens in despair. Bloom, 

experiencing a definite lack of support, goes crashing to 

the floor.


BIALYSTOCK

OOOOOHH! OOOOOHH! OOOOOHH! OOOOOHH! 

I WANT THAT MONEY!


CAMERA ON BLOOM AS HE LIES STRICKEN ON THE FLOOR.


BLOOM

(to himself)

Oh, I fell on my keys.

(he shifts slightly 

to make himself more 

comfortable)

I've got to get out of here.


BIALYSTOCK

(angrily hovering 

over Bloom)

You miserable, cowardly, wretched 

little caterpillar. Don't you ever 

want to become a butterfly? Don't 

you want to spread your wings and 

flap your way to glory?


Bialystock flaps his arms like a huge predatory bird.


BLOOM

(his eyes widened in 

terror)

You're going to jump on me.


Bialystock stares at him incredulously.


BLOOM

You're going to jump on me. I know 

you're going to jump on me -- like 

Nero jumped on Poppea.


BIALYSTOCK

(nonplussed)

What???


BLOOM

(by now he is shrieking)

Poppea. She was his wife. And she 

was unfaithful to him. So he got mad 

and he jumped on her. Up and down, 

up and down, until he squashed her 

like a bug. Please don't jump on me.


BIALYSTOCK

(shouting and jumping 

up and down next to 

Bloom)

I'm not going to jump on you!


BLOOM

(rolling away in terror)

Aaaaaaaaaa!


BIALYSTOCK

(hoisting Bloom to 

his feet)

Will you get a hold on yourself.


BLOOM

(up on his feet and 

running for cover)

Don't touch me! Don't touch me!


He runs to a corner of the room. Trapped! He turns.


BIALYSTOCK

What are you afraid of? I'm not going 

to hurt you! What's the matter with 

you?


BLOOM

I'm hysterical. I'm having hysterics. 

I'm hysterical. I can't stop. When I 

get like this, I can't stop. I'm 

hysterical.


Bialystock rushes to the desk. Picks up a carafe of water 

and shoshes its contents into Bloom's face.


BLOOM

I'm wet! I'm wet! I'm hysterical and 

I'm wet!


Bialystock in a desperate move to stop Bloom's hysterics, 

slaps him across the face.


BLOOM

(holding his face)

I'm in pain! And I'm wet! And I'm 

still hysterical!


Bialystock raises his hand again.


BLOOM

No! No! Don't hit. It doesn't help. 

It only increases my sense of danger.


BIALYSTOCK

What can I do? What can I do? You're 

getting me hysterical.


BLOOM

Go away from me. You frighten me.

(he indicates the 

sofa)

Sit over there.


Bialystock sits on the sofa.


BIALYSTOCK

(exasperated)

Okay. I'm way over here. Is that 

better?


BLOOM

It's a little better, but you still 

look angry.


BIALYSTOCK

How's this?

(he smiles sweetly)


BLOOM

Good. Good. That's nice. That's very 

nice. I think I'm coming out of it 

now. Yes. Yes. I'm definitely coming 

out of it. Thank you for smiling.  

It helped a great deal.


BIALYSTOCK

(for want of something 

sensible)

Well, you know what they say, "Smile 

and the world smiles with you."  

Heh, heh.

(to himself)

The man should be in a straight 

jacket.

(to Bloom)

Feeling better?


BLOOM

Much, thank you. But I am a little 

lightheaded. Maybe I should eat 

something. Hysterics have a way of 

severely depleting one's blood sugar, 

you know.


BIALYSTOCK

They certainly do. They certainly 

do. Come, let me take you to lunch.


BLOOM

That's very kind of you, Mr.  

Bialystock, but I...


BIALYSTOCK

(interrupting)

Nonsense, nonsense, my dear boy. I 

lowered your blood sugar, but least 

I could do is raise it a little.


Bloom looks at him suspiciously.


BIALYSTOCK

And I promise you faithfully, I won't 

discuss that silly scheme to make a 

million dollars anymore.


Bialystock dons his cape and "belasco" hat. From a rack he 

selects a gold-topped walking stick. He goes to door, opens 

it, and with a grand flourish, motions Bloom to precede him.


BIALYSTOCK

Avanti!


Bloom graciously complies. They exit.


CUT TO EXTERIOR. ENTRANCE OF BIALYSTOCK'S OFFICE BUILDING.


The door opens. It is held by Bialystock. Bloom exits building 

into street.


BLOOM

(to Bialystock, who 

is holding door)

Thank you.


BIALYSTOCK

Je vous empris.


They turn up 45th street and head toward broadway. Bialystock 

reaches into his pocket and counts his money. He looks 

worried. Suddenly his face brightens.


We see what Bialystock sees.


CUT TO MURRAY THE BLINDMAN WORKING 45TH STREET.


CAMERA BACK TO BIALYSTOCK AND BLOOM.


Bialystock drops a step behind, quickly takes off his hat 

and flings it through the air.


BIALYSTOCK

(pointing to his hat)

My hat.


BLOOM

I'll get it.


He races after it.


Bialystock detours slightly toward Murray the Blindman, who 

wears a large cardboard sign with the legend: "Murray the 

Blindman. You can see. I can't. Give!" Inscribed on it. 

Bialystock reaches down into his cup and grabs a fist full 

of coins.


BIALYSTOCK

Murray, I'm going to lunch. I took 

two dollars.


MURRAY THE BLINDMAN

Okay, Bialy, that makes six eighty 

you owe me.


BIALYSTOCK

I know. Don't worry. You'll get it. 

You'll get it.


MURRAY THE BLINDMAN

(tapping his way along)

Well, don't forget about it. I need 

it. Nobody understands. I'm competing 

with giants. The Greater New York 

Fund. The March of Dimes. The 

Community Chest. They're driving me 

out of business.


Bloom comes dashing back with hat in hand.


BLOOM

(out of breath)

I got it, Mr. Bialystock.


He proffers hat to Bialystock. Bialystock takes it.


BIALYSTOCK

Thank you, Leo. And call me Max. You 

know, I don't let everybody call me 

Max. It's only people I really like.


BLOOM

(trying it on)

Okay... Max! And you can call me 

Leo.


BIALYSTOCK

I already have. Come on.


BLOOM

Oh.


BIALYSTOCK

Where would you like to eat?


BLOOM

Well, Max, I don't know, Max. What 

do you think, Max?


Bialystock quietly winces at the surfeit of max.


BIALYSTOCK

Let me see... it's such a beautiful 

day. Why waste it indoors. I've got 

it! Let's go to Coney Island! We'll 

lunch at the sea shore.


BLOOM

Coney Island??


BIALYSTOCK

What's the matter, Leo? Don't you 

like Coney Island?


BLOOM

I... I love it. I haven't been there 

since I was a kid. But it's nearly 

two o'clock. I really should be 

getting back to Whitehall and Marks.


BIALYSTOCK

Nonsense! As far as Whitehall and 

Marks are concerned, you're working 

with Bialystock, right?


BLOOM

Right.


BIALYSTOCK

Then stick with Bialystock!


SWISH PAN CUT TO CONEY ISLAND.


FAR SHOT OF BIALYSTOCK AND BLOOM AMIDST THE CROWD AT A CUSTARD 

STAND.


CAMERA ZOOMS IN. TWO SHOT.


BIALYSTOCK

(to Custard Man)

We'll have another round.


CUSTARD MAN

What kind now, sports?


BIALYSTOCK

What kind now, Leo?


BLOOM

(he's loosening up)

I don't know. Let's see. We've had 

chocolate, vanilla, banana - let's 

go green.


BIALYSTOCK

(to Custard Man)

Two pistachios, my good man.


CUSTARD MAN

I'm not your good man, I happen to 

own this establishment.

(he turns to fill the 

order)


BIALYSTOCK

Everybody's a big shot.

(turns to Bloom)

Well, Leo, are you having a good 

time?


BLOOM

I don't know. I think so. I feel 

very strange.


BIALYSTOCK

Maybe you're happy.


BLOOM

Yes. That's it. Happy. Well, whatta 

ya think of that. Happy.


QUICK DISSOLVE TO BIALYSTOCK AND BLOOM ON THE WHIP (A CONEY 

ISLAND RIDE). They are tightly squeezed into one of the moving 

seats. They are between "whips".


BLOOM

(licking his pistachio 

custard.  He is 

ecstatic)

I love it. I love it. Get set. We're 

coming to another turn.


BIALYSTOCK

(working, relentlessly 

working on Bloom)

Bloom, it can always be like this.  

Life can be beautiful. Let me show 

you. Stick with...


They hit the turn.


BIALYSTOCK

Bialysto-o-o-o-ckk.


QUICK DISSOLVE TO BARKER SELLING TICKETS IN FRONT OF TUNNEL 

OF LOVE. MEDIUM SHOT OF EXIT. A little boat comes out. In it 

are a man and a woman embracing. It is followed by another.  

In it there is a sailor kissing a girl. Boat number three 

comes out. In it are Bialystock and Bloom.


CLOSE IN TO A TIGHT TWO SHOT. Bloom is mesmerized. Bialystock 

speaks in a soft, enchanting tone.


BIALYSTOCK

Money is honey. Money is honey. Money 

can put soft things next to your 

skin. Silk... satin... women.


CLOSE-UP OF BLOOM'S EYES. They widen on the word "women."


QUICK DISSOLVE TO PARACHUTE JUMP. Bialystock and Bloom are 

seated in a little gondola that swings beneath a huge 

parachute. They are buckling themselves in.


BLOOM

But if we're caught, we'll go to 

prison.


BIALYSTOCK

(sensing victory, he 

marshals his forces 

for the final assault)

You think you're not in prison now? 

Living in a grey little room. Going 

to a grey little job. Leading a grey 

little life.


BLOOM

You're right. You're absolutely right. 

I'm a nothing. I spend my life 

counting other people's money -- 

people I'm smarter than, better than.  

Where's my share? Where's Leo Bloom's 

share? I want, I want, I want, I 

want everything I've ever seen in 

the movies!


The parachute begins to ascend. We follow.


BLOOM

(coming out of it)

Hey, we're going up.


BIALYSTOCK

You bet your boots, Leo. It's 

Bialystock and Bloom -- on the rise.  

Upward and onward. Say, you'll join 

me. Nothing can stop us.


Bialystock offers his hand to Bloom.


BLOOM

(shouting at the top 

of his lungs)

I'll do it! By God, I'll do it!


Bloom grabs Bialystock's hand and shakes it firmly.


BIALYSTOCK

This is where we belong, Leo. On top 

of the world. Top of the world!


They hit the top. The parachute is released, they quickly 

plummet down.


BIALYSTOCK

Oiiiiiii!!!


BLOOM

Ohhhhhhhh!!!


Bialystock and Bloom drop out of frame.


SLOW DISSOLVE TO BIALYSTOCK'S OFFICE. NIGHT. OVERHEAD SHOT. 

Bialystock and Bloom are bathed in a small pool of 

concentrated light. They are down to their shirt sleeves. 

They are feverishly reading play manuscripts. All about them 

are strewn coffee containers, some empty, some half-filled. 

There is a huge pile of discarded scripts on the floor.


CUT TO TIGHT SHOT OF LEO BLOOM AS HE READS SCRIPT. He looks 

up, pushes his glasses back and massages the bridge of his 

nose.


BLOOM

Max, let's call it a night. It's two 

in the morning. I don't know what 

I'm reading anymore.


PULL BACK TO TWO SHOT.


BIALYSTOCK

Read, read. We've got to find the 

worst play ever written.


Bialystock turns his attention to a new script. He cracks it 

open and begins reading.


BIALYSTOCK

Hmmnn. "Gregor Samsa awoke one morning 

to find he had been transformed into 

a giant cock-a-roach."


In a rage Bialystock flings The manuscript onto the pile of 

discards as he bellows:


BIALYSTOCK

It's good!!!


CAMERA MOVES UP AND WE DISSOLVE THROUGH TO MEDIUM SHOT OF 

OFFICE. Bialystock and Bloom are thoroughly disheveled and 

badly in need of a shave.


BLOOM

(mumbling to himself 

as he reads)

Wait a minute, I've read this part.  

I'm reading plays I read this morning.


He gets up, stretches, goes to window and raises shade. 

Sunlight floods the room. He reels back as though struck.


BLOOM

Good lord, it's morning. Let's face 

it, we'll never find it.

(he turns to face 

Bialystock)

Max, tomorrow's another day. Today's 

another day.


BIALYSTOCK

(off-camera.  Crazy 

little voice)

We'll never find it, eh? We'll never 

find it, eh? Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.


CUT TO BIALYSTOCK. He is standing. At his feet lies a script.  

He dances around it, his arms folded across his chest.


BIALYSTOCK

(as he does an insane 

little jig around 

the script)

You can't smell it when it's under 

your nose. You can't see it when 

it's right before your eyes. You 

can't feel it when it's in your hand, 

when it's in your pocket.


CUT TO MEDIUM SHOT.


BLOOM

Max, what is it? What are you doing?  

What's happening?


BIALYSTOCK

I'll tell you what's happening.  

We've struck gold. Not fool's gold, 

but real gold. The mother lode. The 

mother lode. The mother of them all.


BLOOM

(brightening)

You found a flop!


BIALYSTOCK

A flop, ha! That's putting it mildly.  

A disaster! A catastrophe! An outrage! 

A guaranteed-to-close- in-one-night 

beauty!


He bends down, picks up the script and shakes it in Bloom's 

face.


BIALYSTOCK

This is freedom from want forever.  

This is a house in the country.  

This is a Rolls Royce and a Bentley. 

This is wine, women and song and 

women.


Bloom snatches the script from his hands and reads aloud the 

title.


CUT TO CLOSE-UP. TITLE OF SCRIPT.


BLOOM

(voice over)

"SPRINGTIME FOR HITLER, A Gay Romp 

with Adolph and Eva in 

Berchtesgarten." Fantastic!


BACK TO TWO SHOT. BIALYSTOCK AND BLOOM.


BIALYSTOCK

It's practically a love letter to 

Hitler!


BLOOM

(ecstatic)

It won't run a week!


BIALYSTOCK

Run a week? Are you kidding? This 

play has got to close in the first 

act.


BLOOM

Who wrote it?


CUT TO AUTHOR'S NAME ON THE MANUSCRIPT: By FRANZ LIEBKIND.


DISSOLVE THROUGH AUTHOR'S NAME TO BIALYSTOCK AND BLOOM, SHAVED 

AND DAPPER, WALKING DOWN STREET IN A RUN-DOWN TENEMENT 

NEIGHBORHOOD.


BLOOM

Here it is -- 415.


They march up stoop to number 415. Their motion is arrested 

by a querulous command issued in phlegmatic tones by the 

Superintendent of the building (a woman in her late forties) 

who is leaning out of her window which is adjacent to the 

stoop.


SUPER

Who do you want?


BLOOM

(taken aback)

I beg your pardon?


SUPER

Who do you want? No one gets in the 

building unless I know who they 

want... I'm the concierge. My husband 

used to be the concierge. He's dead. 

Now I'm the concierge.


BIALYSTOCK

(imperiously)

We are seeking Mr. Franz Liebkind.


SUPER

Oh, the kraut. He's on the top floor. 

Apartment twenty-three.


BLOOM

Thank you.


They start into the building.


SUPER

But you won't find him there. He's 

up on the roof with his birds. He 

keeps birds. Dirty, disgusting, 

filthy, lice-ridden birds. You used 

to be able to sit out on the stoop 

like a person. Not anymore. No sir. 

Birds! You get my drift?


BLOOM

We... uh... get your drift. Thank 

you, Madam.


SUPER

I'm not a madam. I'm a concierge.


Bialystock and Bloom enter the building.


CUT TO FRANZ LIEBKIND. He is in his early forties. He is 

wearing, as always, a german helmet. He crouches beside a 

huge pigeon coop. In his left hand he tenderly holds a pigeon. 

In his right, a small photo of Adolph Hitler. He shows the 

picture to the bird. He moves it back and forth until he is 

sure the bird is focused on it properly.


LIEBKIND

(to pigeon)

Hilda, look... look good... Hilda, 

you're not looking. Hilda, if he 

lives, I know you will find him.


He kisses the bird and tosses it skyward.


CUT TO ROOF DOOR. Bialystock and Bloom enter onto the roof. 

They look for Liebkind. He is not on that side of roof. They 

walk around to other side. As soon as they turn the corner, 

they spot Liebkind crouched near the coop.


BLOOM

(quietly to Bialystock)

He's wearing a German helmet.


BIALYSTOCK

(in a fierce whisper)

Shhh. Don't say anything to offend 

him. We need that play.

(cups his hands to 

his mouth and calls 

up to the coop)

Franz Liebkind?


Liebkind is not aware of their presence until he hears his 

name called.


Startled, he quickly flips Hitler's picture under his helmet.


LIEBKIND

(he speaks with a 

German accent)

I vas never a member of the Nazi 

party. I am not responsible. I only 

followed orders. Who are you?


BIALYSTOCK

Mr. Liebkind, wait. You don't 

understand.


LIEBKIND

Vhy do you persecute me? My papers 

are in order. I love my country.

(he sings)

"Oh, beautiful for spacious skies, 

For amber vaves of grain."


BIALYSTOCK

Mr. Liebkind, wait...


LIEBKIND

(singing)

"I'm a Yankee Doodle Dandy...


BIALYSTOCK

(interrupting)

Mr. Liebkind, relax, relax, we're 

not from the government. We came 

here to talk to you about your play.


LIEBKIND

My play? You mean, "Springtime For..." 

you know who?


BIALYSTOCK

Yes.


LIEBKIND

Vat about it?


BIALYSTOCK

We loved it. We thought it was a 

masterpiece. That's why we're here. 

We want to produce it on Broadway.


LIEBKIND

You're not, as you Americans say, 

dragging my leg, are you?


BLOOM

No, not at all sir, we're quite 

serious. We want to produce your 

play.

(he reaches into his 

attache case and 

displays a legal 

looking document)

I have the contracts right here.


LIEBKIND

(looking up)

Oh joy of joys! Oh, dream of dreams!  

I can't believe it.

(he turns to the 

pigeons)

Birds, birds, do you hear? Otto, 

Bertz, Heintz, Hans, Wolfgang, do 

you hear? Ve are going to clear the 

Fuhrer's name. Fly, fly, spread the 

words.


He opens the cages and sets the birds free.


LIEBKIND

(singing at the top 

of his lungs)

"Deutchland, Deutchland, uber alles, 

Uber alles in der velt."


Bialystock and Bloom look at each other in alarm.


LIEBKIND

(singing for all he's 

worth)

"Deutchland, Deutchland..."


BLOOM

(shouting)

Mr. Liebkind, Mr. Liebkind.


Liebkind stops singing.


LIEBKIND

Vat?


BLOOM

People can hear you.


LIEBKIND

OH.

(he sings)

"I'm a Yankee Doodle Dandy, Yankee 

Doodle is my..." Listen, this is not 

place to talk. Come! We go to my 

flat. An occasion like this calls 

for Schnapps.


DISSOLVE TO FRANZ LIEBKIND'S APARTMENT. Liebkind has just 

finished pouring three glasses of schnapps. He puts the bottle 

on a tray.


LIEBKIND

(as he hands glasses 

to Bialystock and 

Bloom)

Mr. Bloom, Mr. Bialystock. Gentleman, 

with your permission, I would like 

to propose a toast to the greatest 

man that ever lived. Let us say his 

name quietly to ourselves. The walls 

have ears.


CUT TO TIGHT SHOT OF FRANZ LIEBKIND.


LIEBKIND

(a fervent whisper)

Adolph Hitler.

(he downs drink)


CUT TO TIGHT SHOT OF BLOOM.


BLOOM

(whisper)

Sigmund Freud.

(he downs drink)


CUT TO TIGHT SHOT OF BIALYSTOCK.


BIALYSTOCK

(whisper)

Max Bialystock.

(he downs drink)


BACK TO SCENE.


LIEBKIND

I vas vit him a great deal, you know.


BIALYSTOCK

With whom?


LIEBKIND

(astonished by the 

question)

Vit the Fuhrer, of course. He liked 

me. Out of all the household staff 

at Berchtesgarten, I vas his favorite. 

I vas the only one allowed into his 

chambers at bedtime.


BIALYSTOCK

No kidding?


LIEBKIND

Oh, sure. I used to take him his hot 

milk and his opium. Achhh, those 

were the days. Vat good times ve 

had. Dinner parties vit lovely ladies 

and gentlemen, singing und dancing. 

You know, not many people knew about 

it, but the Fuhrer vas a terrific 

dancer.


BIALYSTOCK

Really, I never dreamed...


LIEBKIND

(flies into an 

indignant rage)

That's because you were taken in by 

that verdampter Allied propaganda.  

Such filthy lies. But nobody said a 

bad vord about Winston Churchill, 

did they? Oh no, Vin Vit Vinnie!

(he gestures V for 

victory)

Churchill, vit his cigars and his 

brandy and his rotten paintings.  

Couldn't even say Nazi. He would say 

Narzis, Narzis. Ve vere not Narzies, 

ve vere Nazis. But let me tell this, 

and you're getting it straight from 

the horse, Hitler vas better looking 

than Churchill, he vas a better 

dresser than Churchill, had more 

hair, told funnier jokes, and could 

dance the pants off Churchill!


BIALYSTOCK

(swinging along)

That's exactly why we want to do 

this play. To show the world the 

true Hitler, the Hitler you knew, 

the Hitler you loved, the Hitler 

with a song in his heart.

(to Bloom)

Leo, quick, the contract.


Bloom quickly whips the contract out of his pocket, produces 

a pen, hands them to Bialystock. Bialystock spreads the 

contract out on the table before Liebkind.


BIALYSTOCK

Here, sign here, Franz Liebkind.  

And make your dream a reality.


He hands Liebkind the pen. Liebkind refuses it.


LIEBKIND

Wait. No. How do I know I can trust 

you? How do I know you vill present 

this play in the manner and spirit 

in vhich it vas conceived?


BIALYSTOCK

We swear it!


LIEBKIND

Not good enough... Vould you be 

villing to take the Siegfried oath?


BIALYSTOCK

Yes. We would!


INSERT: CLOSE-UP BLOOM. He looks worried.


LIEBKIND

Good. I will make the preparations.


Liebkind leaves the room.


BLOOM

(anxious whisper)

Max, I don't want to take any 

Siegfried Oath. I don't know what it 

is, but I don't want to take it. We 

might end up in the German Army.


BIALYSTOCK

Shut up, you idiot. He's a harmless 

nut. Play along with him. It's almost 

in the bag.


Liebkind enters. He is laden down with all sorts of 

ritualistic paraphernalia. Liebkind places all the stuff on 

the table. Without a word to them, he goes to phonograph.


In a few seconds we hear the opening strains of Wagner's 

"Ride Of The Valkyries." As the music booms louder, Liebkind 

addresses them.


LIEBKIND

Please to don your helmets.


From the table they take classic Wagnerian helmets (with 

horns) and place them on their heads.


LIEBKIND

Please to light your candles.


They each take a huge white candle from the table and light 

it. Liebkind flicks the light switch. Now they are in the 

dark except for the glow of their candles.


LIEBKIND

Please repeat after me. I solemnly 

swear...


BIALYSTOCK AND BLOOM

I solemnly swear...


LIEBKIND

By the sacred memory...


BIALYSTOCK AND BLOOM

By the sacred memory...


LIEBKIND

Of Siegfried...


BIALYSTOCK AND BLOOM

Of Siegfried...


LIEBKIND

Wagner...


BIALYSTOCK AND BLOOM

Wagner...


LIEBKIND

Nietzche...


BIALYSTOCK AND BLOOM

Nietzche...


LIEBKIND

Bismark...


BIALYSTOCK AND BLOOM

Bismark...


LIEBKIND

Hindenburg...


BIALYSTOCK AND BLOOM

Hindenburg...


LIEBKIND

The Graf Spee...


BIALYSTOCK AND BLOOM

The Graf Spee...


LIEBKIND

The Blue Max...


BIALYSTOCK AND BLOOM

The Blue Max...


LIEBKIND

And last, but not least, Adolph... 

you know who.


BIALYSTOCK AND BLOOM

And last, but not least, Adolph... 

you know who.


LIEBKIND

(saluting)

Heil you know who!


BIALYSTOCK AND BLOOM

(spiritlessly saluting)

Heil you know who!


LIEBKIND

Good. Good. Now ve sign the contract.


BIALYSTOCK

Good. Good.

(he hands Liebkind 

the pen)


LIEBKIND

No. No. Not in ink. We'll desecrate 

the oath. It must be done in blood.


CUT TO BLOOM'S FACE. It is a silent oi.


LIEBKIND

Fingers, please.


Bialystock and Bloom extend their forefingers and look the 

other way. Liebkind pricks them with the sacred safety pin, 

and squeezes a few drops of blood from each into the sacred 

vessel (a jar cover). He does the same with his own finger.


LIEBKIND

Ve vill sign vit this sacred qvill 

taken from the last chicken I served 

at Berchtesgarten.


Liebkind signs. "The Ride Of The Valkyries" reaches its 

zenith. It echoes through the room as we fade out.


FADE IN ON BIALYSTOCK AND BLOOM AS THEY WALK UP STREET AWAY 

FROM TENEMENT. It is late afternoon. They are both wearing 

swastika arm bands.


BIALYSTOCK

(triumphantly whacking 

the contract with 

the back of his hand)

There it is... in red and white! 

"Springtime For Hitler," signed, 

sealed and delivered.

(he notices Bloom's 

dour expression)

What's the matter with you?


BLOOM

Look, I'm just not wearing this arm 

band. I don't care how big the deal 

is.


BIALYSTOCK

(placating him)

Okay, take it off, take it off.


They take off their arm bands and toss them into a litter 

basket. Bialystock spots a passing taxi. He whistles. It 

stops.


BIALYSTOCK

(to cab driver as he 

opens door)

The Blue Gypsy.


BLOOM

(about to enter cab 

with Bialystock)

Why are we going to the Blue Gypsy?!


BIALYSTOCK

(stopping Bloom from 

entering cab)

We are not going to The Blue Gypsy.  

I am going to The Blue Gypsy.


Bialystock gets into cab and slams the door. He continues 

speaking to Bloom through the window.


BIALYSTOCK

I have a rendez-vous with a lady of 

some means. You see dear Bloom, phase 

one is complete, the play is ours. 

We are now entering phase two -- the 

raising of the money. In the days to 

come, you will see very little of 

me, for Bialystock is launching 

himself into little-old-lady-land.

(to cab driver)

Avanti!


The cab speeds away.


SWISH PAN CUT TO TIGHT SHOT OF LITTLE OLD LADY #3. In her 

hand she holds a bubbling glass of champagne. She raises it 

to Bialystock.


PULL BACK TO TWO SHOT OF BIALYSTOCK AND LITTLE OLD LADY. 

They are seated in a corner booth of a little Viennese cafe.


LITTLE OLD LADY #3

Here's to the success of your new 

play.


Bialystock raises his glass.


BIALYSTOCK

Our play, my love.


He gallantly intertwines his arms in hers in a lover's toast.  

It is hard to drink with arms entwined, especially if one of 

the arms is attached to a little old lady. The toast is a 

fiasco, Bialystock getting most of the champagne over his 

vest and trousers.


LITTLE OLD LADY #3

Oh, I'm sorry, Bialy, did I wet you?


BIALYSTOCK

Think nothing of it, my dear. A mere 

trifle. A mere trifle. Did you bring 

your checkbook?


LITTLE OLD LADY #3

It's right here in my purse and I 

made it out just as you told me -- 

to cash. That's a funny name for a 

play.


BIALYSTOCK

Think nothing of it.


She snaps open her little beaded purse, takes out the check 

and begins to hand it to Bialystock. At this moment, we are 

assaulted by the passionate sound of a crying violin.


CAMERA PULLS BACK TO REVEAL A VIOLINIST IN GYPSY ATTIRE 

CLOSING IN ON THE TABLE. The little old lady is delighted by 

the violinist and unfortunately for Bialystock stops the 

passage of the check as her attention is diverted. Bialystock 

cautiously reaches out to snatch the check but each time 

that he does, a turn in the music makes the little old lady 

clutch her heart. Bialystock is very unhappy. He quietly 

brings his foot from beneath the table and places it directly 

over the foot of the violinist.


CUT TO CLOSE-UP OF BIALYSTOCK'S FOOT POISED OVER VIOLINIST'S 

FOOT. Bialystock proceeds to crush violinist's foot.


CUT TO VIOLINIST'S FACE. Somehow it conveys to us all the 

misery and pain of the human condition. With eyes crossed by 

grief, he limps to another table. Bialystock quickly reaches 

out and snatches the check.


SWISH PAN CUT TO HANSOM CAB THREADING ITS WAY THROUGH CENTRAL 

PARK. NIGHT.


CUT TO INTERIOR OF CAB. Bialystock is cozily ensconced with 

Little old lady #4.


BIALYSTOCK

(taking check from 

old lady)

Thank you, my dear.


LITTLE OLD LADY #4

Oh, Bialy, Bialy, tell me again. 

Tell me again.


BIALYSTOCK

Edna, I swear on my life, you don't 

look a day over sixty-five.


SWISH PAN CUT TO CITY TRAFFIC. DAY. A taxi fills the screen.  

As it moves out of frame, we discover Bialystock and little 

old lady #5 astride a red and white honda motor scooter. As 

they roar past the camera, Bialystock shouts.


BIALYSTOCK

Clear the road! Clear the road!


LITTLE OLD LADY #5

(clutching Bialystock 

fiercely)

Go, Bialy, baby, go!


SWISH PAN CUT TO POSH PARK AVENUE APARTMENT. NIGHT. A private 

concern is in progress. A thin, consumptive-looking young 

man fingers his way through a chopin nocturne.


CAMERA SLOWLY PANS THE ROOM. Seated in a semi-circle around 

the piano on various pieces of delicate empire furniture is 

an austere group of elderly dignified patrons of the arts. 

Suddenly an old lady's shriek rends the air. Everyone's head 

turns.


LITTLE OLD LADY #6

(slightly flustered)

Go on with the concert! Go on with 

the concert! It's nothing. Nothing.


Bialystock stares straight ahead.


LITTLE OLD LADY #6

(to Bialystock, smiling)

You dirty man.


SWISH PAN CUT TO NEW YORK STREET. Old fashioned limousine 

pulls into view. The window shades are drawn. As it passes, 

we detect strange sounds emanating from the interior.


LITTLE OLD LADY #7

(off camera)

Tee hee, ha ha ha, ho ho, ooo, ooo, 

teehee hee.


BIALYSTOCK

(off camera, 

simultaneously)

Heh, heh, heh. Hah, hah, hah.


The car drives out of frame.


SWISH PAN CUT TO SCULPTOR'S ATELIER. DAY. An ancient little 

old lady wearing a sculptor's smock is feebly chipping away 

with chisel and hammer at a huge square block of marble. She 

makes not a scratch on it.


CAMERA DOLLIES BACK TO REVEAL BIALYSTOCK, HER SUBJECT, 

STANDING NUDE, EXCEPT FOR LOIN CLOTH, HOLDING UP AN ENORMOUS 

GLOBE. He is obviously atlas.


LITTLE OLD LADY #8

(stepping back to 

admire her work)

Well, Bialy, how's it coming?


BIALYSTOCK

It's beautiful, Alma, beautiful.

(to the heavens)

Oi.


SWISH PAN CUT TO LIVING ROOM. NIGHT. Bialystock, dressed as 

a turkish slave, is asleep on the sofa. The room has been 

done in a byzantine decor. The strains of Scheherazade softly 

fill the room. Suddenly a whip comes flashing into the frame 

and whacks against the torso of the sleeping Bialystock.


SHOT WIDENS TO REVEAL 'HOLD ME, TOUCH ME' WIELDING THE WHIP. 

She is dressed in an 'Aarabian Nights' costume.


HOLD ME, TOUCH ME

Dance! Dance, slave!


Bialystock is up in a flash and into a quick turkish time 

step so as to avoid the deadly lash.


BIALYSTOCK

How's this?


HOLD ME, TOUCH ME

Faster, faster, you dog. Excite me, 

delight me. Hold me, touch me.


CUT TO CLOSE-UP OF BIALYSTOCK'S FACE AS HE DANCES.


BIALYSTOCK

(murmuring to himself)

Money is honey, money is honey.


DISSOLVE TO BIALYSTOCK'S OFFICE. NIGHT. Bialystock is seated 

at the desk. On one side of him is a large stack of signed 

investor contracts. On the other an equally large pile of 

unsigned ones. Bialystock signs furiously, as Bloom feeds 

the contracts to him.


BLOOM

(handing Bialystock 

contract)

Mrs. Sarah Catheart. She owns 50% of 

the profits.


Bialystock dutifully signs. Bloom takes another and places 

it before Bialystock.


BLOOM

Mrs. Eleanor Biddlecombe. She also 

owns 50% of the profits.


Bialystock signs. Bloom puts the next one down.


BLOOM

Mrs. Virginia Resnick. She also owns 

50% of the profits.


Bialystock signs. Bloom takes another.


BLOOM

Mrs. Alma Wentworth. She owns 100% 

of the profits.


Bialystock signs. Then looks up at Bloom.


BIALYSTOCK

Leo, what if this play is a hit?


BLOOM

Then the Department of Justice owns 

100% of Bialystock and Bloom.


BIALYSTOCK

(Bloom's thought makes 

him unhappy)

OI. I'm depressed. Leo, do me a favor. 

Open the safe. I want to see the 

money.


Leo, humoring him, spins the combination dial on safe and 

opens it.


CUT TO INSIDE OF SAFE. It is jammed full of neatly stacked 

piles of money.


CUT TO BIALYSTOCK ON HIS HANDS AND KNEES IN FRONT OF SAFE.


BIALYSTOCK

(to himself. Inhales 

deeply)

That's better.


Bialystock takes out a stack of neatly folded bills. He smells 

it, kisses it and puts it in his pocket.


BLOOM

What are you doing?


BIALYSTOCK

I'm going to buy a toy. I worked 

very, very hard and I think I deserve 

a toy.


BLOOM

(quizzically)

A toy?


DISSOLVE TO CLOSE-UP, FACE OF A GORGEOUS BLONDE, ULLA. DOLLY 

BACK TO REVEAL THE REST OF HER. She is incredibly well-

endowed.


CUT TO BIALYSTOCK AND BLOOM. Their eyes glued to her form.


BLOOM

That's a toy?


BIALYSTOCK

Yes. She's an adult, educational toy 

made in Sweden for children over 

fifty.


Bloom stares at him.


BIALYSTOCK

Stop looking at me like that. She's 

not an indulgence. She happens to be 

our new receptionist. She goes with 

our new surroundings.


QUICKLY PAN POSH NEW WALL-PAPER, FURNISHINGS, ETC.


BIALYSTOCK

Ulla, I'd like you to meet my partner 

and associate, Mr. Leo Bloom.


ULLA

Got dag pa dig.


BLOOM

How do you do.

(to Bialystock)

Have you gone mad? A receptionist 

that can't speak English. What will 

people say?


BIALYSTOCK

They'll say, "Oooh, wah, wah, wah, 

ooh, ooh."


BLOOM

What is she gonna do here?


BIALYSTOCK

I'll show you. Ulla, go to work.


ULLA

Ya, sur.


Ulla goes to phonograph and places needle on record. The 

driving sound of a twist fills the room. Ulla sensuously 

twists, vibrates, frugs, watusis and rocks her body in time 

with music.


BIALYSTOCK

See, it helps the day go by. Ulla, 

okay. Okay.


Ulla stops, goes to phonograph and takes needle off.


BIALYSTOCK

Go to desk. Answer telephone.


He picks up phone to show her.


BIALYSTOCK

Bialystock and Bloom. Bialystock and 

Bloom.


ULLA

(repeating to herself 

as she leaves)

Bialystock and Blum. Bialystock and 

Blum. Bialystock and Blum. Got dag 

pa dig. Bialystock and Blum.


BIALYSTOCK

(to Bloom, opening up 

a box on his desk)

Hey, Blum, have a cigar.


BLOOM

No thanks.


Bialystock takes an enormous black cigar.


BLOOM

Max, maybe...


Bialystock reaches under his desk. Presses buzzer. We hear 

buzzing sound in ante-room.


BLOOM

What's that?


BIALYSTOCK

Nothing. Nothing. Go on.


Ulla enters. Goes to desk, picks up cigarette lighter, lights 

Bialystock's cigar, kisses him.


ULLA

(pinching Bialystock's 

cheek)

Min Bialystock.


Ulla leaves.


BIALYSTOCK

Nice girl.


BLOOM

Max, as I was saying, maybe we should 

go easy on the spending. I mean these 

offices and everything.


BIALYSTOCK

Why? Take it when you can get it! 

Flaunt it, baby, flaunt it!


BLOOM

But if something should... God 

forbid... go wrong, at least we could 

give them some of their money back.  

It would look better in court.


BIALYSTOCK

Stop talking like that, you white 

mouse! Nothing's going to go wrong. 

As a matter of fact, today I have 

taken steps to insure total disaster.  

At two o'clock we have an appointment 

with none other than Roger De Bris.


BLOOM

(searching)

Roger De Bris. Roger De Bris. Oh 

yes, the director. Is he good... I 

mean bad?


BIALYSTOCK

Roger De Bris is the worst director 

that ever lived.


BLOOM

Do you think he'll take the job?


BIALYSTOCK

Only if we ask him.


Bialystock consults his watch.


BIALYSTOCK

Come on. We'd better hurry. We're 

late.


Bialystock buzzes. Ulla enters.


BIALYSTOCK

Call chauffeur. Get car.


ULLA

(smiling)

Good. Good. We go Motel.


BIALYSTOCK

No. We go.

(he indicates Bloom 

and himself)


ULLA

You, Blum go Motel.


BIALYSTOCK

No. No Motel. Get car. Get car.


ULLA

(as she leaves)

Get car. Get car.


BIALYSTOCK

Very nice girl.


DISSOLVE TO STREET IN FRONT OF CHIC TOWNHOUSE UPPER SIXTIES. 

DAY. A white Rolls Royce limo pulls up. A liveried chauffeur 

with small latin-type mustache gets out and opens door for 

passengers. Bialystock and Bloom get out.


BIALYSTOCK

(to chauffeur)

Thank you, Rudolfo.


Bialystock and Bloom climb the steps to the front door. 

Bialystock pushes the doorbell. We hear chimes.


BIALYSTOCK

(whispering)

Now don't let anything he does or 

says upset you. He's a little 

peculiar.


BLOOM

What do you mean?


The door opens. Framed in the doorway is a thin, strange 

looking man in a black turtleneck sweater. (Carmen Giya) he 

contemplates them coldly.


CARMEN

Yesssssss?


BIALYSTOCK

I am Max Bialystock. This is my 

associate, Mr. Bloom. We have an 

appointment with Mr. De Bris.


CARMEN

Ah, yes, you're expected. Please 

come in.


They enter the vestibule. Carmen closes the door behind them.


CARMEN

How do you do. I'm Carmen Giya, Mr.  

De Bris' private secretary. Would 

you be so kind as to remove your 

shoes.


Bialystock and Bloom look at each other bewildered.


CARMEN

White, white, white is the color of 

our carpets.


Bialystock and Bloom remove their shoes.


CARMEN

(to Bloom indicating 

a rack of slippers)

Now, let's see, you're wearing grey.  

I would suggest the crimson. They're 

a little vivid, but your suit is so 

quiet.

(to Bialystock, 

studying his mish 

mash attire)

Why don't you... Oh, take anything.  

Please follow me.


Carmen leads the way. Bialystock and Bloom scuff after him. 

We follow them down a narrow corridor lined with examples of 

classic greek sculpture -- each one depicting nude males in 

various poses.


INT: ELEVATOR.


CUT TO ROGER DE BRIS' BOUDOIR SITTING ROOM. It is elegantly 

feminine.


Chaise lounge, antique mirrors, Louis XVI armoire and dressing 

table. From behind an ornate dressing screen, we hear muffled 

sounds of discontent.


DE BRIS

(from behind screen)

I'll never get into this damned thing.


CUT TO BOUDOIR ENTRANCE. Carmen, Bialystock and Bloom enter.


CARMEN

(to De Bris)

We're not alone.


De Bris' head pops over the screen. He is a once handsome, 

now dissipated man in his late forties.


DE BRIS

Ah, Messers Bialystock and Bloom, I 

presume. Ha, ha, ha, forgive the 

pun.


BLOOM

(to Bialystock)

What pun?


BIALYSTOCK

(a curt whisper)

Shut up. He thinks he's witty.

(to De Bris)

It's good to see you again, Roger.  

Did you get a chance to read 

"Springtime For Hitler?"


De Bris emerges from behind the screen. He is wearing a "Lady 

Windermere's fan" style dress.


DE BRIS

Remarkable. Remarkable. A stunning 

piece of work.


BLOOM

(shocked, whispers)

Max! He's wearing a dress.

(his mouth remains 

open)


BIALYSTOCK

Shhhhhh.


DE BRIS

(continuing)

I think it's a very important play. 

I, for one, never realized that the 

Third Reich meant Germany. I mean 

it's drenched with historical goodies 

like that.


De Bris is suddenly aware of Bloom's expression. (Bloom's 

mouth is still agape.)


DE BRIS

Oh, dear, you're staring at my dress.  

I should explain. I'm going to the 

Choreographer's Ball tonight. There's 

a prize for the best costume.


CARMEN

(smugly)

We always win.


DE BRIS

(looking in the mirror)

I'm not so sure about tonight. I'm 

supposed to be the Grand Duchess -- 

I think I look more like Tugboat 

Annie. What do you think?


He parades back and forth, executing sharp turns like a model 

at a fashion show.


DE BRIS

No be cruel. Be brutal. Be brutal. 

Because heaven knows they will. Well, 

what do you think, Mr. Bloom?


BLOOM

(very embarrassed)

Well, it's... uh... it's nice and 

long... I mean, it's... uh... uh... 

where do you keep your wallet?


BIALYSTOCK

(jumping in)

It's gorgeous. Absolutely gorgeous.  

You couldn't have picked a better 

color. It brings out your eyes. Let's 

face it, Roger, that dress is you.


DE BRIS

(his eyes flashing 

flirtatiously)

Do you really think it brings out my 

eyes?


CARMEN

(irritated)

We can't tell a thing without your 

wig. As far as I'm concerned, you're 

only half-dressed.


DE BRIS

Ummmm. Well, if you're so worried 

about the wig, get it, o' wicked 

witch of the west.


Carmen turns in a huff and leaves to get the wig. De bris 

reaches into cut crystal cigarette box, takes cigarette, 

taps it, and holds it for a light.


BIALYSTOCK

(in a whisper to Bloom)

Quick, light his cigarette. He likes 

you.


Bloom nervously reaches for a book of matches, rips one out 

and strikes it. It doesn't light. He tries another and 

another. One finally catches fire. He tries to hold it steady, 

but he is too nervous. De Bris firmly places his hand over 

Bloom's to steady the flame.


DE BRIS

Didn't I meet you on a summer cruise?


He lights the cigarette but continues to hold Bloom's hand.


BLOOM

I've... I've... never been on a 

cruise.


DE BRIS

Oh, quel dommage.


Carmen enters carrying wig. He sees De Bris holding Bloom's 

hand.


CARMEN

(snidely)

Oh, I see we're getting acquainted.


De Bris drops Bloom's hand and turns on Carmen.


DE BRIS

How would you like to go back to 

teasing hair, big mouth?


BIALYSTOCK

Roger, do you mind if we talk a little 

business?


DE BRIS

Please, please, that's what we're 

here for.

(to Carmen, who is 

adjusting the wig)

Be careful, that hurt.


BIALYSTOCK

I think this would be a marvelous 

opportunity for you, Roger. Up to 

now, you've always been associated 

with musicals, and...


DE BRIS

Yes. Dopey show-girls in gooey gowns. 

Two-three-kick-turn! Turn-turn-kick-

turn! It's enough to make you throw 

up! At last a chance to do straight 

drama! To deal with conflict, with 

inner truth. Roger De Bris presents 

history.  Of course, I think we should 

add a little music. That whole third 

act has got to go. They're losing 

the war. It's too depressing. We'll 

have to put something in there.

(gripped by his vision)

Aaahghhh! I see it! A line of 

beautiful girls, dressed as Storm 

Troopers, black patent leather boots, 

all marching together... Two-three-

kick-turn! Turn-turn-kick-turn!


BIALYSTOCK

That's genius. That's genius. Roger, 

I think I speak for Mr. Bloom and 

myself when I say that you're the 

only man in the world who can do 

justice to SPRINGTIME FOR HITLER.


DE BRIS

(in one rush)

Wait a minute. This is a very big 

decision. It might effect the course 

of my entire life. I'll have to think 

about it. I'll do it.


De Bris extends his hand. Bialystock shakes it.


BIALYSTOCK

Congratulations.


DE BRIS

(to Carmen)

Get on the phone. Send out a casting 

call. Call every agent in town. I 

want to see everybody. Everybody.


DISSOLVE TO STAGE DOOR OF BROADWAY THEATRE. DAY. Sign on 

door reads: CASTING TODAY -- SPRINGTIME FOR HITLER.


QUICK DISSOLVE TO INTERIOR OF THEATRE. The place is a 

madhouse. Hundreds of would-be Hitlers fill the stage. Each 

and every one with the Fuhrer's haircut and little square 

mustache. There are tall Hitlers, short Hitlers, fat Hitlers, 

skinny Hitlers, method Hitlers, shakespearean Hitlers, all 

kinds Hitlers.


CUT TO FIRST ROW OF AUDIENCE. Seated there, watching the 

bedlam, are Bialystock and Bloom, De Bris, Carmen Giya and 

Franz Liebkind.


BIALYSTOCK

(looking for the least 

likely Hitler)

Roger, what about that one? The fat 

Hitler on the right?


DE BRIS

I don't know. I rather fancy that 

one.


CUT TO BEAUTIFUL, BLOND, MUSCULAR, YOUNG MAN, WHO LOOKS AS 

IF HE IS POSING FOR "BODY BEAUTIFUL." He bears not the 

slightest resemblance to hitler even though he does sport a 

little black mustache.


CUT BACK TO BIALYSTOCK.


BIALYSTOCK

Not bad. Not bad. What do you think, 

Franz?


LIEBKIND

(very emotional)

I don't know. I don't know. For some 

strange reason, I'm deeply moved.

(he wipes away a tear)


DE BRIS

(getting to his feet)

Oh, this is bedlam, bedlam. We must 

have some order.


De Bris, followed by Carmen, hops to the stage and addresses 

the milling mob.


DE BRIS

(clapping his hands 

for attention)

Will all the dancing Hitlers please 

wait in the wings. We're only taking 

the singing Hitlers.


As the dancing Hitlers leave the stage, Carmen arranges the 

singing Hitlers so that they are in a long straight line 

against the back of the stage wall. Carmen reads out a name 

and the first singing hitler walks downstage to audition. 

Except for a sporty little Hitler mustache, he bears little 

resemblance to the Fuhrer.


CARMEN

Arthur Packard.


DE BRIS

Hello, Arthur. Tell us something 

about yourself.


ARTHUR PACKARD

(in a strangulated 

tenor's voice)

I was the lead tenor of the 

Albuquerque Opera Company for two 

seasons. I just finished a road tour 

of STUDENT PRINCE. And last season I 

was up for the lead in the Broadway 

production of Circus Man.


DE BRIS

What happened?


ARTHUR PACKARD

I didn't get it.


DE BRIS

What are you going to sing for us 

Arthur?


As Arthur tells him the title of his song, De Bris mouths it 

word for word toward his friend, Carmen.


ARTHUR PACKARD

The soliloquy from CAROUSEL.


From the pit the piano plays a four bar introduction.


ARTHUR PACKARD

(sings)

My boy Bill will be strong and as 

tall as a...


DE BRIS

Thank you.


Arthur shrugs and leaves the stage.


DE BRIS

Next please.


CARMEN

Jason Green.


Jason Green comes downstage. He is a big, barrel-chested 

man. He also wears Hitler-type mustache.


DE BRIS

Well, Jason, what have you been doing 

lately?


JASON GREEN

(in basso profundo)

For the last sixteen years, I've 

been touring with "Naughty Marietta."


DE BRIS

Good. And what are you going to sing 

for us, Jason?


As Jason tells him the song's title, De Bris once again mouths 

it word for word with him.


JASON GREEN

"Stout-Hearted Men."


Beginning of "Stout-Hearted Men" montage.


There is a short piano introduction.


JASON GREEN

(singing)

"Give me some men Who are stout-

hearted men Who will fight for the 

right they adore."


DE BRIS

(off-camera voice)

Thaaank you.


DISSOLVE TO A NEW HITLER SINGING (LITTLE BALD MAN)


BALD HITLER

(singing)

"Show me some men Who are stout-

hearted men And I'll soon show you 

ten thousand more."


DE BRIS

(off-camera voice)

Thaaank you.


DISSOLVE TO ANOTHER HITLER (ITALIAN BASSO)


ITALIAN HITLER

(singing)

"Shoulder to shoulder and bolder and 

bolder They grow as they march to 

the war."


DE BRIS

(voice off camera)

Thaaank you.


DISSOLVE TO DELICATE HITLER


DELICATE HITLER

(singing)

"There is nothing in this world can

DE BRIS

(voice off camera)

Thaank you.


DISSOLVE TO SHORT-HAIRED WOMAN HITLER


SHORT-HAIRED WOMAN HITLER

"When stout-hearted men Will get 

together man to man."


DE BRIS

(voice off camera)

Thaaank you.


CUT TO CARMEN GIYA ON STAGE. It is now empty.


CARMEN

Well, that's it.


CUT TO FIRST ROW OF AUDIENCE. Slow pan Bialystock, Bloom, De 

Bris, and Liebkind. They are tired, disheveled and unhappy.


BLOOM

I think that's enough Hitlers for 

one day. Maybe we'll get lucky 

tomorrow.


BIALYSTOCK

You think out of all those Hitlers 

you could find just one...


LIEBKIND

It was the same thing in Germany.  

We looked for years before we found 

the right Hitler.


From off-stage we hear the sharp click of boots approaching.  

All eyes turn toward the stage. From out of the wings steps


A young person in a leather doublet, high leather boots, and 

extremely long hair. It carries a guitar. Until it speaks, 

we are not sure whether it is a young man or a young woman. 

(LORENZO ST. DU BOIS)


LSD

Hey, man.


CARMEN

I beg your pardon.


LSD

Is this where they're auditioning 

Boomerang?


CARMEN

(studying him coldly)

No, I'm afraid you've wandered into 

the wrong theatre.


LSD

(to himself, as he 

starts to leave)

Man, freaked out again.


BIALYSTOCK

(leaping to his feet)

Wait! This is Boomerang. This is 

Boomerang.


DE BRIS

(to Bialystock)

What are you saying?


BIALYSTOCK

Let's hear him. What have we got to 

lose?

(to LSD)

What's your name?


LSD

Lorenzo Saint DuBois. But everybody 

calls me LSD.


DE BRIS

What have you done, LSD?


LSD

Six months, I'm out on probation, 

but it's cool now, baby.


DE BRIS

I mean in show business.


LSD

Oh, in show business. Well, let's 

put it this way, my next job will be 

my debut.


DE BRIS

What do you do best?


LSD

Hey, man, I can't do that here, that's 

what they put me away for.


DE BRIS

Oh, sing. Sing!


LSD

Hey, baby, that's where they put me, 

Sing-Sing. How'd you know that, you 

been up?


DE BRIS

(a little hysterical)

Sing a song! Just sing a song!


LSD

Here's a little thing I think you're 

going to see on the charts any day.  

I wrote it last night in my sleep.  

It's a Hindu Zen Folk Rock Ballad.


LSD sings "I'm The Victim Of A Multi-Mystic Freak-Out." The 

song is geared to the au courant "raga rock" beat. Phrases 

such as, "Connect with the infinite" and "Turn on the world." 

Lorenzo finishes the number.


CUT TO BIALYSTOCK, BLOOM, LIEBKIND AND DE BRIS. They are 

stunned. Bialystock is the first to recover.


BIALYSTOCK

(shouting)

That's our Hitler!


LIEBKIND

(howls of despair)

Vaaaat???


BIALYSTOCK

(quickly)

Franz, don't you see, Hitler was a 

man of his time. This is a man of 

his time.


LIEBKIND

But he has long hair!


BIALYSTOCK

Don't look at the outside, look at 

the inside. It's the inner Hitler 

we're after. The young beautiful 

Hitler, who danced his way to glory.


LIEBKIND

I don't know. I don't know.


DE BRIS

(he has been studying 

LSD intensely)

Could be an exciting piece of off- 

beat casting. Of course, we'd have 

to do something about that coiffure.


LIEBKIND

But he's so crazy, he's so sloppy, 

he's so... so... American!


BIALYSTOCK

Franz, trust me. I promise I won't 

let you down.


LIEBKIND

All right, but remember, if you damage 

the Fuhrer's reputation, I kill you.


DISSOLVE TO MARQUEE OF BROADWAY THEATRE. MARQUEE READS:


OPENING TONIGHT - SPRINGTIME FOR HITLER.


Directed by ROGER DE BRIS.


PAN DOWN TO THEATRE ENTRANCE. The sidewalk is choked with 

opening nighters, all aglitter in diamonds, furs and elegant 

tuxedos. Luxurious black limousines pull up to the curb, 

depositing their rich contents, the majority of which are 

Little old ladies.


CUT TO LOBBY. There in the midst of the swirling confusion 

stand Bialystock and Bloom in their opening night tails. 

Bialystock is resplendent in a black silk cape, lined in 

crimson satin. Bloom's tails are obviously rented. They are 

near the ticket taker. As some of the opening night 

"supporters" enter the theatre, they shout encouragements to 

Bialystock and Bloom. To each of the well-wishers, Bialystock 

responds with a smile and a mumble. They get the smile, we 

hear the mumble.


FIRST WELL-WISHER

(a silver-haired 

gentleman in his 

late fifties)

Good luck, Max, I hope it's a big 

hit.


BIALYSTOCK

(mumbling)

Bite your tongue.


SECOND WELL-WISHER

(a little old lady)

We're gonna do it this time, Bialy, 

I just know it.


BIALYSTOCK

I hope you lose your bloomers.


THIRD WELL-WISHER

(another old lady)

My prayers go with you, Bialy.


BIALYSTOCK

God Forbid.


CUT TO LIMOUSINE PULLING UP IN FRONT OF THEATRE. Doorman 

opens door, assists rich couple out of car. Limousine pulls 

away. A motorcycle with side-car roars up to front of theatre. 

At the handlebars, beautifully decked out in tuxedo and his 

ever popular german helmet is Franz Liebkind.


CAMERA FOLLOWS LIEBKIND AS HE ENTERS LOBBY. He makes his way 

through the milling throng toward Bialystock and Bloom.


LIEBKIND

(to Bialystock and 

Bloom, very seriously)

Gentlemen, this is a very momentous 

moment.


He clicks his heels and shakes hands with each of them.


LIEBKIND

(to Bloom)

Good luck.

(to Bialystock)

Good luck.


He starts into theatre, stops, turns back to Bialystock and 

Bloom.


LIEBKIND

(a mad gleam in his 

eye)

Tonight, New York. Tomorrow, the 

world!


He turns triumphantly and enters the theatre.


OFF-CAMERA VOICE (GIRL)

Check your hat?


LIEBKIND

(off camera)

No!!


BIALYSTOCK

So much for Nutsy Fagin.


BLOOM

(nudging Bialystock, 

whispers)

Here comes the Times Drama Critic.


BIALYSTOCK

Watch closely, as Bialystock drives 

the last nail into the coffin.


Bialystock ambles over to the times critic, who has stopped 

to chat with some people.


BIALYSTOCK

Always delighted to see the gentlemen 

of the press. There you are, sir. 

Two on the aisle, compliments of the 

management.

(he smiles unctuously)


DRAMA CRITIC

(haughtily accepting 

tickets)

Thank you. Here, wait a minute. There 

seems to be some mistake. There's a 

hundred dollar bill wrapped around 

these tickets.


BIALYSTOCK

(conspiratorially)

It's no mistake. Enjoy the show.


DRAMA CRITIC

(outraged)

Mr. Bialystock, just what do you 

think you're doing?


BIALYSTOCK

I'm bribing you. And if you play 

ball, there's a lot more where that 

came from.


Bialystock winks and saunters off.


DRAMA CRITIC

(blustering with rage)

I... I... I... How dare he! I've 

never been so insulted in my life!  

The gall of the man! The incredible 

gall of the man! I'll fix his wagon.


The critic stalks into the theatre. As he passes Bialystock, 

he contemptuously flings the hundred dollar bill to the floor.  

He disappears through the door.


OFF-CAMERA VOICE

Check your hat?


DRAMA CRITIC

(off camera)

No!!


Bialystock reaches down, picks up crumpled dollar bill, 

straightens it out, puts it in his pocket.


BIALYSTOCK

(grinning like a 

Cheshire cat)

Heh, heh, heh. He'll kill us.


From inside the theatre, we hear the overture beginning. 

Lights in the lobby blink.


BLOOM

Come on, they've started the overture.


Bialystock and Bloom enter the theatre.


CUT TO REVERSE ANGLE. Bialystock and Bloom entering darkened 

theatre. They take positions at the back of the house. Bloom 

extends his hand to Bialystock. He intends to speak in a 

confident and controlled manner but what comes out is an 

hysterical shriek.


BLOOM

(casually shrieking)

Well, Max, this is it!!!


He scares himself and quickly claps his hands over his mouth.


BLOOM

(whispers)

I'm sorry, I'm a little nervous.


BIALYSTOCK

Relax, in two hours our worries will 

be over.


CUT TO STAGE. As the overture is concluded, the curtain slowly 

rises. On stage there is a line of girls dressed in sexy 

storm trooper costumes--black patent leather boots, etc. 

Their arms are linked about one another as they dance and 

kick in radio city music hall Rockette fashion.


STORM TROOPER CHORUS

(singing)

Germany was having trouble, What a 

sad, sad story. Needed a new leader 

To restore its former glory. Where, 

oh, where was he, Who could that man 

be, We looked around, And then we 

found, The man for you and me, And 

now its...


The Storm Trooper Rockettes part and from above them, 

descending twin staircases, we see two lines of beautiful 

showgirls, holding huge balloons above their heads. On each 

balloon is painted a picture of the Fuhrer. Everyone sings 

as they descend.


ENTIRE CHORUS

(singing)

"Springtime for Hitler," etc.


CUT TO AUDIENCE. Number on stage continues.


CLOSE-UP OF MAN AND WOMAN ON AISLE.


WOMAN (DOWAGER)

This is shocking!


CUT TO ANOTHER AREA OF AUDIENCE. ANOTHER COUPLE.


MAN (STUFFED SHIRT)

Outrageous!


CUT TO CRITIC ON THE AISLE, BIALYSTOCK'S P.O.V. He scowls as 

he furiously makes notes.


CUT TO BIALYSTOCK AND BLOOM AT BACK OF THEATRE. They are 

smiling. Bialystock points to couple who have left their 

seats and started up the aisle.


BIALYSTOCK

Ahhhhh, it's going better than I 

expected.


The couple comes abreast of Bialystock and Bloom.


WOMAN

(to man as they exit 

theatre)

Well, talk about bad taste.


BIALYSTOCK

(he chuckles as they 

leave)

Come, let us repair to the bar across 

the street. I don't want to be caught 

here during intermission. We'll be 

stoned to death.


They link arms and merrily march out of the theatre.


CUT TO STAGE. "Springtime For Hitler" opening is ending in a 

great crescendo of patriotic insanity.


ENTIRE CHORUS

(singing)

So Springtime for Hitler, Is 

Springtime for Goering, Is Springtime 

for Goebbels, Is Springtime for 

Himmler, Is Springtime for you and 

me!!


Curtain falls. The number is received by the audience with 

hushed silence. Followed by a surge toward the doors. The 

aisles are choked with unhappy people, who can't wait to get 

out.


Curtain rises. On stage are Eva Braun and Hitler (LSD). Eva 

Braun is a fetching blonde in long braids. LSD is pacing up 

and down. Eva Braun sits on love seat downstage. In her hand 

is an oversized daisy. As she pulls the petals from it, she 

whines. She has a pronounced american accent.


EVA

Er liebt mir. Er liebt mir nicht.  

Er liebt mir.

(the last petal)

Er liebt mir nicht.


CUT TO PEOPLE IN AISLE. They have noticeably slowed down. 

Some are walking backwards. They are intrigued.


CUT BACK TO STAGE.


EVA

(turns to LSD)

Du liebt mir nicht!


LSD

(protesting vehemently)

I lieb you baby, I lieb you. You 

know that.


EVA

If you lieb me, why are you leaving 

me?


LSD

Hey, man, I can't spend all my time 

with you. I took an oath, baby, 

Deutschland uber alles.


CUT TO AUDIENCE IN AISLES. They have all stopped leaving to 

turn and watch. Some begin to laugh and others applaud. They 

like LSD.


MAN

That's Hitler? I get it! It's a put-

on.


CUT TO WOMAN.


WOMAN

Hey, Harry, he's funny.


Now there is a mad rush to regain their seats.


CUT TO INTERIOR BAR. It is empty except for the Bartender 

and a Drunk at the far end of the bar. Bialystock and Bloom 

are seated on stools at the bar. They clink glasses.


BIALYSTOCK

Here's to the one and only performance 

of "Springtime For Hitler."


They both laugh and down their drinks. Bialystock raps on 

the bar with his cane.


BIALYSTOCK

Innkeeper, innkeeper, another round 

of drinks here. As a matter of fact, 

a round of drinks for everybody in 

the place!


Bartender looks around at the almost empty barroom. Does a 

little take. He then replenishes their drinks and places a 

glass in front of the Drunk. The Drunk tips his hat graciously 

towards Bialystock.


BLOOM

Just think, yesterday I was a 

meaningless little accountant -- and 

today, I am the producer of a Broadway 

flop!


BIALYSTOCK

(raising his glass)

To failure!


BLOOM

To failure!


DRUNK

(blushing)

Oh, thank you! It's very kind of 

you.

(raises his glass and 

downs his drink)


CUT BACK TO STAGE. Same scene. Eva starts to cry.


EVA

If the Duke of Windsor could give up 

the Throne of England for the woman 

he loved, why can't you?


LSD

It's different. I'm a tyrant, baby.


Audience laughs.


CUT TO FRANZ LIEBKIND SEATED IN AN AISLE SEAT. He nervously 

pinches his face as he semi-coherently mumbles to himself.


LIEBKIND

(becoming slightly 

unhinged)

Baby, why does he keep saying baby?  

I didn't write baby. The Fuhrer never 

said baby. Vat is it vit this baby?


WOMAN IN ADJOINING SEAT.


(VERY ANNOYED)

Will you shut up!


LIEBKIND

You shut up! I'm the author. You're 

just the audience. I outrank you.


CUT TO BAR. Bialystock and Bloom are a little tipsy. By now 

the Drunk has joined them and all three are good pals.


BIALYSTOCK

Bartender, bartender, another drink 

for myself and my associate, Mr.  

Bloom. And don't forget our good- 

natured inebriate over there.


Drunk tips his hat graciously.


DRUNK

Eternally grateful. Sincerely yours, 

Oliver Wendell Drunk.


During Drunk's speech, bartender has refilled their glasses. 

He stands back, watching them as he dries glasses.


DRUNK

(raises his glass)

A toast!


BLOOM

To what?


DRUNK

(stumped)

To... toast! I love toast.


BIALYSTOCK AND BLOOM

To toast.


BIALYSTOCK

(smacking his glass 

down on the bar)

Now I'll take the lead and I want 

you right behind me all the way!  

One... two... three!

(singing)


"By the light,


BLOOM AND DRUNK

(singing)

"By the light, by the light,


BIALYSTOCK

"Of the silvery moon,


BLOOM AND DRUNK

"Of the silvery mooooon,


BIALYSTOCK

"I want to croon,


BLOOM AND DRUNK

"He wants to croon, he wants to croon,


BIALYSTOCK

"To my honey I'll croon,


BLOOM AND DRUNK

"He's gonna croon love's tune,


BIALYSTOCK

"Honeymoon,


BLOOM AND DRUNK

"Honeymoon, honeymoon,


BIALYSTOCK

"Keep a shining in...


Bialystock stops abruptly. He points toward the door. We 

hear the sound of people entering the bar.


BIALYSTOCK

Intermission! Quick, hide your face.  

They'll tear us to pieces.


Bialystock and Bloom hop on their stools and cover their 

faces with their hands. The Drunk shrugs, hops on the stool 

next to them and also hides his face. A horde of first 

nighters sweeps into the bar. They are all around Bialystock, 

Bloom and the Drunk, clamoring for drinks.


CROWD

(ad-lib)

"Scotch on the rocks," "Bourbon and 

soda." "Two martinis." "Whiskey sour."


The crowd is very cheerful. They are still bubbling from the 

first act.


WOMAN

(to her escort)

Well, so far that's about the funniest 

thing I've ever seen on Broadway.


Bialystock and Bloom look at each other.


WOMAN'S ESCORT

Never laughed so much in my life.


MAN

(to his friend)

Hysterical, absolutely hysterical.


MAN'S FRIEND

I thought I'd split my sides.


BIALYSTOCK

Take it easy, don't panic. There are 

a lot of plays on this street. They 

are not necessarily talking about 

"Springtime For Hitler."


HUSBAND

(to his wife)

Honey, I never in a million years 

thought I'd ever love a show called 

"Springtime For Hitler."


Bialystock and Bloom freeze. A little old lady comes up behind 

Bialystock. She raps him on the back with her umbrella.


LITTLE OLD LADY #8

Bialy, you sly fox, you've done it. 

It's a smasheroo.


BIALYSTOCK

(in a daze)

Smasheroo. Smasheroo.


The crowd starts to leave.


LITTLE OLD LADY #8

Oh, I'd better hurry back. I don't 

want to miss one minute of it.


The first nighters leave the bar. All that remain are 

Bialystock and Bloom, the Bartender and the Drunk. Bialystock 

slips off the stool and wanders to middle of barroom.


BIALYSTOCK

(dazed)

Got to think... Got to think... Got 

to think... Got to think... Got to 

think...


CUT TO BLOOM AT THE BAR, FROZEN, STARING STRAIGHT AHEAD. His 

eyes are glazed with shock. He strokes his cheek with his 

little blue blanket.


BLOOM

Mrs. Cathcart -- 50% Mrs. Biddlecombe -- 

50% Mrs. Wentworth -- 50% Mrs. Resnick -- 

100%


The Drunk stares from one to the other. Unhappy with their 

present mood, he decides to liven things up again. He tiptoes 

over to Bialystock, puts his arms around Bialystock's waist, 

rocks back and forth and begins to sing.


DRUNK

(singing)

"By the light... By the light, by 

the light... Of the silvery...


Bialystock picks him up and throws him across the bar.


BIALYSTOCK

Get away from me, you drunken bum!


Drunk picks himself up and dusts himself off.


DRUNK

(indignantly)

Fairweather friend!


The Drunk staggers out of the bar. Bialystock gets a hold of 

himself.


BIALYSTOCK

Maybe it's not true!


Bialystock rushes over to Bloom.


BLOOM

(still mumbling to 

himself)

No way out. No way out.


BIALYSTOCK

Bloom, Bloom, maybe it's not true.


Bloom does not respond. Bialystock shakes him.


BLOOM

(droning monotonously)

No way out. No way out. What? Who?


BIALYSTOCK

Why don't we go over to the theatre 

and see what's really happening? 

After all, we've only heard from a 

small portion of the audience. Let's 

hear what the majority thinks.


BLOOM

(in a trance)

The majority. The majority. Yes. 

Let's hear from the majority.


They start to leave.


DISSOLVE TO BIALYSTOCK AND BLOOM ENTERING LOBBY OF THEATRE. 

As they open door to theatre, they are greeted by a shock 

wave of laughter. They pause stricken.


BLOOM

I don't want to go in.


BIALYSTOCK

Come, we have to.


They take each other's hands like two frightened little boys 

and cautiously walk in.


CUT TO BIALYSTOCK AND BLOOM AS THEY ENTER. They take their 

positions at the back of the house and watch the proceedings 

meekly, like two lambs awaiting the slaughter.


CUT TO STAGE. Hitler has obviously called a council of war. 

The Fuhrer is surrounded by his General Staff.


GENERAL

(making a report)

We are falling back on all fronts.  

Our soldiers are retreating.


LSD

No good, baby, no good. You heard my 

orders. Nobody retreats. Attack!  

Attack!


GENERAL

Who can we attack? They're all too 

big.


LSD

(getting an inspiration)

Hey, man, let's stomp Switzerland!


GENERAL

We can't... we keep our money there!


CUT BACK TO BIALYSTOCK AND BLOOM. They stare straight ahead, 

stony-faced. Huge tears well up in their eyes and run down 

their cheeks.


CUT TO LIEBKIND. He has ripped off the arm of his chair and 

is earnestly gnawing at it.


LIEBKIND

Baby, again with that baby. There 

must be no more babies.


Liebkind leaps from his seat and heads toward the side 

entrance leading to the stage.


CUT BACK TO STAGE.


LSD

Where's Goebbels? Where's my little 

Joe?


GENERAL

(to the wings)

Send for Goebbels.


LSD

He's the only cat left that still 

grooves me.


Goebbels enters laughing.


GOEBBELS

Heil, baby! I just finished the 

morning propaganda broadcasts.


LSD

What did you tell the people?


GOEBBELS

I told them we invaded England.


LSD

Hey, baby, that's good! How'd we 

come out?


GOEBBELS

We won.


LSD

Groovy!


They smack hands.


Laugh from audience.


CUT TO BACKSTAGE. Liebkind comes charging in like a lunatic.


LIEBKIND

Bring down the curtain! Bring down 

the curtain!


He rushes for the curtain rope. A stagehand attempts to stop 

him. He rips off his helmet and bangs him over the head with 

it. As he slumps to the ground, Liebkind undoes the curtain 

rope.


CUT TO ACTORS ON STAGE.


LSD

Goebbels, you're the only one...


The curtain drops with a thud. From beneath it crawls 

Liebkind. He jumps up and addresses the audience.


LIEBKIND

I am the author of this play. You 

are the victims of a hoax. These are 

not my words. The Fuhrer never said 

baby. The Fuhrer was sweet, the Fuhrer 

was kind, the Fuhrer was good.


STAGE MANAGER

(off camera)

Get that curtain up.


Curtain starts to rise. Liebkind hurls himself it, and holds 

it down.


LIEBKIND

NO! No! The curtain must not go up!


Despite his efforts, the curtain slowly rises. Liebkind does 

not release his hold on it. He starts to go up.


LIEBKIND

Stop! Stop!


As the curtain rises, we see a bewildered group of actors 

and stage hands watching Liebkind's ascent. The audience, 

thinking Liebkind's behavior part of the show, enjoys the 

proceedings tremendously. They break into applause.


CUT TO CRITIC. He is laughing uproariously and tearing up 

his notes.


CUT BACK TO LIEBKIND.


LIEBKIND

We have been betrayed! I will return!  

I will returnnnnn...


Liebkind disappears into the flies.


DISSOLVE TO ANTEROOM OF BIALYSTOCK AND BLOOM'S OFFICE. DAY. 

Ulla, wearing a belted raincoat, sits at the typewriter. 

Music from a record player softly rocks in the background. 

In her left hand she holds a glass of champagne, from which 

she sips, while her right hand, index finger extended, stabs 

at the funny little keys. She is happy, it is the right one. 

The door flies open. The desperate Bialystock and Bloom enter. 

Ulla leaps up, quickly undoes her raincoat, exposing her 

delicious body, clothed only in black lace underthings.


ULLA

We make love?


BIALYSTOCK

No! No! We don't make love. Go to 

work.


Ulla immediately turns up record player to a crashing blare 

and does her groovy dance. Bialystock howls in despair and 

flees into his office together with Bloom.


He closes the door, shutting out the noise. The office is 

filled with flowers and congratulatory telegrams. Bialystock 

swoops down on the telegrams. He rips one open and begins 

reading.


BIALYSTOCK

"Congratulations. It's the biggest 

hit on Broadway."


He tears it up and throws it away. He picks up another and 

reads.


BIALYSTOCK

"Congratulations. Hitler will run 

forever."


He throws it away. Bialystock attacks the pile of telegrams. 

Without opening them up, he tears them one at a time.


BIALYSTOCK

(boiling with rage)

Congratulations!


He tears telegram.


BIALYSTOCK

Congratulations!


He tears telegram.


BIALYSTOCK

Congratulations!


He tears telegram.


BIALYSTOCK

Congratulations!


He tears telegram.


The door swings open. Posed in the doorway is roger De Bris. 

In one hand he carries an open, bubbling magnum of champagne.


DE BRIS

(ecstatic)

Congratulations! Have you seen the 

reviews? Have you seen the lines at 

the box office? It's a torrent, it's 

an avalanche, it's the biggest hit 

on Broadway!


He starts into the room. Bialystock growls and lunges at 

him.


BIALYSTOCK

You lousy fruit. You've ruined me!


He smashes De Bris up against the wall. The champagne goes 

flying.


DE BRIS

(shrieking)

Help! Help! He's crazy! He's going 

to kill me. Call the police! Call 

the police! Help, help, murder, 

murder, rape, rape!!!


Bialystock throws him out, slams the door and locks it. He 

falls into the chair and puts his feet up on the desk.


BIALYSTOCK

(moaning)

How could this happen? I was so 

careful. I picked the wrong play, 

the wrong director, the wrong cast. 

Where did I go right? We forgot one 

important, Bloom. Adolf Hitler always 

drew a crowd.


Bialystock is suddenly aware that Bloom is doing strange 

things at the next desk.


BIALYSTOCK

What are you doing?


CUT TO BLOOM. He is feverishly piling ledgers and account 

books together. He swoops them up in his arms, clutches them 

tightly and begins backing towards the door.


BLOOM

(defensively)

Don't try to stop me. I've made up 

my mind.


BIALYSTOCK

What are you doing with those books?  

Where are you going?


BLOOM

(with hysterical 

conviction)

I'm turning myself in. It's the only 

way. I'm going to cooperate with the 

authorities. They'll reduce my 

sentence and then there's time off 

for good behavior. And maybe I'll 

get a job in the prison library. So 

long.


He turns the knob. The door is locked. He fiddles with the 

catch. Too late! Bialystock is up and at him in a flash. He 

blocks the door.


BIALYSTOCK

(reasonably)

Leo, take it easy. Relax, you're 

overwrought. You don't know what 

you're doing. You're acting out of 

panic... GIMME THOSE BOOKS!


Bialystock lunges at Bloom and grabs for the books. Bloom 

still retains a firm hold. They struggle back and forth.


BLOOM

I never should have listened to you.


BIALYSTOCK

I never should have listened to you.


BLOOM

Ohhhhhhhhh, how I hate you.


BIALYSTOCK

Double. Double. Double.


With a mighty wrench, Bialystock rips the books out of Bloom's 

hands.


BIALYSTOCK

(clutching the books 

triumphantly)

Haaaaa! Haaaaa! Haaaaa!


Bloom flips. He attacks Bialystock like a crazy kid, screaming 

hysterically and punching with one arm as he protects his 

face with the other.


BLOOM

(shrieking)

FAT! FAT! FAT! FAT! FAT!


Bialystock goes crashing to the floor under the onslaught.  

Bloom dives on top of him. They roll on the floor locked in 

mortal combat. Suddenly three shots ring out in succession. 

Bialystock and Bloom immediately stop what they're doing and 

turn toward the door.


CUT TO LOCK AND HANDLE OF DOOR. They drop off. A little smoke 

rises from the hole.


LIEBKIND

(off screen, outside 

door)

I am betrayed!


Bialystock and Bloom look at each other.


CUT TO THE DOOR. It flies open. Framed in the doorway is 

Franz Liebkind, smoking luger in hand.


LIEBKIND

(solemnly)

You have broken the Siegfried Oath.  

You must die.


He blasts away. The window is shattered. Pieces of wall go 

whizzing through the air. Bialystock drops the ledgers and 

he and Bloom dive for cover behind the desk.


LIEBKIND

This is no good. I'm not killing 

you. Don't you understand, you have 

broken the Siegfried Oath. You must 

die. Vill you cooperate!!!


CUT TO TIGHT TWO SHOT. Bialystock and Bloom scrunched behind 

desk. They stare at each other in amazement. There is a 

timorous knock at the door.


BIALYSTOCK AND BLOOM

(together)

Come in. Come in.


Ulla enters.


ULLA

I hear noise. You call?


She looks around.


ULLA

Where are you?


She continues walking until she sees them crouched behind 

the desk.


ULLA

Ahhh. I see you. You like something?  

Coffee?


Bialystock and Bloom look at each other in disbelief.


BIALYSTOCK

Coffee. Yes. That's a good idea.

(with great emphasis)

Why don't you ask the gentleman with 

the gun... The gentleman who is 

shooting at us... and trying to kill 

us... what he will have.


ULLA

(to Liebkind)

You like coffee?


CUT TO BIALYSTOCK AND BLOOM. They stare at each other, 

dumbfounded.


LIEBKIND

Yes, please. Black. Two sugars.


Ulla repeats to herself as she starts for the door.


ULLA

Three coffees. Two regular. One 

black... two sugars.


She exits and closes the door behind him.


Bialystock looks up to the fates and makes a small sound of 

despair.


LIEBKIND

And now ve must resume hostilities.  

Are you coming out from behind that 

desk or not?


BIALYSTOCK

Not.


LIEBKIND

Cowards, miserable cringing cowards.  

Clinging to life like baby 

butterflies. Vatch, vatch and 

remember. Franz Liebkind vill show 

you how to die like a man!


He places the muzzle of the gun against his temple. Bloom 

and Bialystock peer over the desk to see.


LIEBKIND

(exhalted)

Soon I vill be vit mine Fuhrer, und 

Goering, und Goebbels, and Himmler.  

I'm coming boys!


He pulls the trigger. Click. Click. Click. The gun is jammed. 

He throws the gun down in disgust.


LIEBKIND

(in utter anguish)

Boy, vhen things go wrong!


He falls into a chair and sobs like a child.


LIEBKIND

I'm a failure. I'm a failure. I'm a 

failure.


Bialystock and Bloom come out from behind desk. Bialystock 

looks at his watch.


BIALYSTOCK

Five o'clock. Killed a whole day 

playing hide-and-seek with a crazy 

Kraut.


Bialystock picks up luger.


LIEBKIND

(still sobbing)

I'm not crazy. I'm inept.


He continues to sob. Bloom walks over to the weeping Liebkind 

and comfortingly pats him on the shoulder.


BLOOM

There, there.


LIEBKIND

(looking around)

Vhere? Vhere?... oh...


BIALYSTOCK

(to Liebkind)

You crazy lunatic! What are you 

shooting at us for? Why don't you 

use this

(indicates gun)

where it will do us some good? Why 

don't you shoot the actors?

(the thought strikes 

home)

Liebkind, have I ever steered you 

wrong?


LIEBKIND

Always.


BIALYSTOCK

Never mind. Listen. Every night people 

are laughing at your beloved Fuhrer.  

Why?


LIEBKIND

It's that LSD und his verdampter 

babies!...


BIALYSTOCK

(handing him the gun 

and some money)

Here. Buy bullets. Kill. Kill them 

all!


BLOOM

What???


BIALYSTOCK

(to Bloom)

Shut up.


LIEBKIND

Yes. The actors. I must destroy the 

actors.


Liebkind starts to go.


BLOOM

Stop! Stop! This is insanity.


He leaps across the room and wrenches the gun from Liebkind's 

hand.


BLOOM

(screaming)

Have you lost your mind? What are 

you talking about? Kill the actors.  

You can't kill the actors -- they're 

not animals, they're human beings!


BIALYSTOCK

They are? Have you ever eaten with 

one? Liebkind, go! Kill!


BLOOM

Liebkind, no!


BIALYSTOCK

(to Bloom)

What are you doing? We're trapped. 

It's either the show or us. There's 

no way out. What can we do, blow up 

the theatre?


Bialystock freezes as the thought takes hold.


CUT TO CLOSE-UP OF BLOOM. His eyes narrow as he seriously 

considers the proposal.


CUT TO CLOSE-UP LIEBKIND. His face a poster of shining 

approval.


CAMERA PULLS BACK. The three of them search each other's 

faces earnestly. They are obviously in accord.


FADE OUT:


FADE IN. Darkened cellar of theatre. We see the faint glow 

of a shielded lamp at the end of a tunnel. As the camera 

moves through tunnel closer and closer to the light, we make 

out the shadowy forms of three men.


CAMERA DOLLIES IN TO REVEAL BIALYSTOCK, BLOOM AND LIEBKIND. 

Bloom is holding a miner's lamp. Liebkind is trying brick 

loose from wall. Bialystock is consulting map. Brick comes 

loose. Liebkind removes it.


LIEBKIND

(the surgeon at work)

Dynamite.


Bloom slaps a neatly taped bundle of dynamite into Liebkind's 

hand. Liebkind gently places it in opening.


LIEBKIND

Fuse cap.


Bialystock reaches into his pocket and hands him a fuse cap. 

Liebkind puts cap in place.


LIEBKIND

Fuse.


Bloom reaches in pocket, takes out spool of fuse, hands it 

to Liebkind.


LIEBKIND

Thank you.


Liebkind ties fuse in place.


LIEBKIND

Gut. Now for the master connection.


CAMERA FOLLOWS THEM AS THEY MOVE BACK THROUGH THE TUNNEL. 

Liebkind trails fuse from spool. They finally emerge into an 

open area of cellar directly beneath the stage.


LIEBKIND

Gut. Now vhere's the other fuse?


Bloom raises his lamp, revealing a similar tunnel on the 

other side of the cellar.


BLOOM

There it is.


CAMERA INSERT: CLOSE-UP SIMILAR FUSE PROTRUDING FROM SECOND 

TUNNEL.


BACK TO SCENE.


LIEBKIND

(to Bloom)

Pick it up and bring it here, please.


BLOOM

Okay.


He starts toward second tunnel.


LIEBKIND

(anxiously)

Where are you going vit the light?


BLOOM

I need it. How'm I gonna find the 

fuse?


LIEBKIND

Oh, ve come vit you. All for one and 

all in the light.


The three of them gingerly tiptoe over to second tunnel 

entrance. Bloom picks up the fuse. They tiptoe back. Bloom 

hands fuse to Liebkind.


Liebkind reaches into his knapsack, takes out little black 

metal box with two terminal caps at either end and sets it 

down on cellar floor.


LIEBKIND

Now ve take the two fuse leads, attach 

them to the terminals of the conductor 

and ve're in business.


BIALYSTOCK

(grinning)

You mean out of business. Heh, heh.


Liebkind begins fiddling with the fuse leads and terminals.


BLOOM

Max, I...


BIALYSTOCK

(irritated. He has 

not time for small 

talk)

What is it?


BLOOM

Well, I... Well, it's just that...  

I'm sorry I called you fat, fat, 

fat.


BIALYSTOCK

(smacking Bloom 

affectionately on 

the shoulder)

Ahhhhhh. Leo, Leo, Leo.


LIEBKIND

(mumbling to himself)

Plus to minus. Negative to positive.  

Male to...


BIALYSTOCK

Come on. Let's get going.


LIEBKIND

Qviet. Qviet. This is very important.


He turns back to his work.


LIEBKIND

Vait a minute. Vait a minute. Male 

to male? Male to female? Female to 

male? Female to female? Vait a minute.  

In people, male to female. But 

electricity is strange. It's male to 

male.


He quickly finishes the connection.


LIEBKIND

Sehr gut.

(to Bialystock)

Slow fuse, please.


Bialystock reaches into his pocket and hands Liebkind a roll 

of fuse.


LIEBKIND

Thank you.


He begins tying slow fuse to conductor.


LIEBKIND

(as he works)

Now ve take the slow fuse. Tie one 

end to the master connection and the 

other ve attach to the detonator.


He finishes connections.


LIEBKIND

Come, ve go to the detonator.


They begin to move back as Liebkind slowly spools out fuse. 

They start up the stairs.


LIEBKIND

Vait a minute. Are you sure this is 

slow fuse? It feels like qvick fuse.

(to Bloom)

Shine your light on it.


Bloom shines light on fuse.


LIEBKIND

I don't know. I don't know. The 

markings are so similar. Qvick fuse 

or slow fuse?


Liebkind takes a wooden match out of his pocket.


LIEBKIND

I must find out. It is critical.


He strikes the match and lights the fuse. Whoosh! It ignites. 

The sparks rush toward the master connection. Liebkind charges 

down the stairs and chases after the quick burning fuse for 

all he's worth. He catches up with it just before it reaches 

the master connection and quickly stamps it out.


LIEBKIND

Let's face it. That was dumb.


He trots back.


LIEBKIND

Boys, vhere is you?


Bialystock and Bloom come crawling out from behind stairs.


LIEBKIND

(seeing them)

Dot vas the qvick one.


BIALYSTOCK

We assumed that.


Liebkind reaches into his pocket and shows them a roll of 

fuse.


LIEBKIND

Here. You see. This is the slow fuse. 

It is much wider. It has more 

resistance, more density. Therefore, 

it burns slower.


BIALYSTOCK

You mean you had the slow fuse in 

your pocket all the time and you 

forgot to put it on?


LIEBKIND

Yes. Amazing isn't it?


Bialystock raises his cane and smashes Liebkind on the helmet.  

Bonnng.


BIALYSTOCK

You stupid kraut!


LIEBKIND

Vhy do you always call me kraut?  

Kraut is cabbage! Do ve call you hot 

dogs? Ve call you Yanks not franks!


BIALYSTOCK

All right. Finish the job. Let's get 

outta here.


CUT TO SIDE DOOR OF THEATRE. The door opens slowly. 

Bialystock, Bloom and Liebkind tiptoe out. Bloom sets 

detonator down.


LIEBKIND

Und now for the final connection.


He wraps the fuse lead around the metal contact pole and 

raises the plunger.


BIALYSTOCK

Wait. I'll check to see if the coast 

is clear.


He runs to the end of the alley. Looks both ways and runs 

back.


BIALYSTOCK

The coast is clear!


LIEBKIND

Good. Get down.


Bialystock and Bloom crouch down and hold their eardrums. 

Liebkind grabs the handle of the detonator. His eyes suddenly 

glisten with tears.


LIEBKIND

Goodbye, my foolish fancy. Goodbye, 

my misbegotten child. Goodbye, my 

tortured testament of twisted truths.


BIALYSTOCK

Do it! Do it!


Liebkind tenses himself for the plunge. He starts and stops.


LIEBKIND

I can't. I can't do it. It's a demon. 

It's a gargoyle, it's a monster... 

but it's still my child.


He sobs inconsolably. Bialystock roughly pushes him aside 

and grabs the handle of the detonator and plunges it down. 

He hurls himself to the ground and covers his head in 

anticipation of the explosion. Nothing happens. After a while 

they all raise their heads curiously.


BIALYSTOCK

(quizzically)

Nothing.


Liebkind goes to plunger, raises handle and examines 

detonator.


LIEBKIND

Here is gut... of course, of course.  

In electricity, it's always male to 

female. But with people, it's not 

always so. Come ve must go back.


BIALYSTOCK

Do you need us?


LIEBKIND

Of course I need you. It's dark in 

there.


BLOOM

Okay, okay. Let's not waste time.


They open the side door and disappear into the theatre.


DRUNK

(off camera, singing)

"Honeymoon, keep a shinin' in June,"


CUT TO ENTRANCE OF ALLEY. Drunk comes staggering into view. 

He spots detonator.


DRUNK

"your silvery beams, Will light love's 

dreams," What the heck is that? A 

bicycle pump? Naaah. Lemme see. Could 

it be? Good grief, it's Eli Whitney's 

cotton gin... Naaah. Aahh, I know 

what it is.


He walks over to detonator and sits on fire stanchion just 

behind it. He raises his foot and starts it down toward the 

plunger.


DRUNK

Shine 'em up!


He pushes plunger down with his foot.


CUT TO LONG SHOT OF THEATRE. (Mock up) there is a terrific 

explosion. Pieces of the theatre go flying through the air.


CUT TO TIGHT SHOT OF DRUNK. He is on his knees. Debris crashes 

all around him. Smoke and noise fill the air. He staggers to 

his feet. He rocks back and forth as though he were in an 

earthquake.


DRUNK

(bravely singing)

"Sa-an Fra-ancisco, open your golden 

gates, Don't let a stranger wait...


DISSOLVE TO TIGHT SHOT OF JUDGE'S GAVEL SOLEMNLY RAPPING FOR 

ORDER.


PULL BACK TO REVEAL CROWDED COURTROOM.


CAMERA MOVES IN TO FOREGROUND OF COURT. There, seated at the 

defendant's table are, in order, Bloom with his arm in a 

sling, Bialystock with his leg in a cast, and a mummy swathed 

in bandages. We know the mummy is Liebkind because it is 

wearing a german helmet.


LIEBKIND

(mumbling through his 

bandages)

Male to male? Male to female?


CUT TO TIGHT SHOT OF JUDGE.


JUDGE

Has the jury reached a verdict?


CUT TO JURY. Their expressions indicate that they are not at 

all well-disposed toward the defendants.


CAMERA CLOSES IN ON FOREMAN. He rises.


FOREMAN

We have, your honor.


JUDGE

(off camera)

How does the jury find?


FOREMAN

We find the defendants incredibly 

guilty.


CUT TO JUDGE.


JUDGE

Will the defendants please rise and 

approach the bench.


CUT TO BIALYSTOCK, BLOOM AND LIEBKIND. They struggle to their 

feet and hobble to the Judge's bench.


JUDGE

Do the defendants have anything to 

say in their behalf before the court 

pronounces sentence?


BLOOM

I would like to say a word, sir, not 

on my behalf, but in behalf of my 

partner, Max Bialystock.


JUDGE

Proceed.


BLOOM

Thank you, your honor. Max Bialystock 

is a very selfish man.


BIALYSTOCK

(whispers to Bloom)

Don't help me.


BLOOM

He's a liar and a cheat and a 

scoundrel. He's taken money from 

little old ladies. He's talked people 

into doing things they never would 

have dreamed of. Especially me. But 

who has he really hurt? Who are the 

victims? Not me, I had the most 

exciting adventure of my life. And 

what about the little old ladies?  

What would their lives have been 

without Max Bialystock? He made them 

feel wanted and young and attractive 

again.


LITTLE OLD LADIES

(off camera, ad-lib)

"Oh, Max, Max, I love you Max." 

"Let him go, let him go." 

"Don't take my Bialy."


JUDGE

(rapping gavel)

Order. Order.


BIALYSTOCK

And may I humbly add, your honor, 

that we have learned our lesson and 

we'll never do it again.


JUDGE

I will take that into consideration. 

The defendants shall serve not more 

than five and not less than two years 

in the State Penitentiary.

(he pounds gavel)


DISSOLVE THROUGH TO SIGN ON STONE WALL. Sign reads: STATE 

PENITENTIARY.


DISSOLVE THROUGH TO PRISON YARD. Detachments of Prisoners, 

led by guards, march past camera.


DISSOLVE THROUGH TO EXTERIOR OF PRISON BUILDING MARKED: PRISON 

LAUNDRY. Much noise and steam.


CAMERA PANS TO ANOTHER BUILDING MARKED: MACHINE SHOP. Loud 

metallic cacophony emanates from inside.


CAMERA CONTINUES ITS JOURNEY. It comes to rest on prison 

auditorium. Tinkle of piano is heard from inside.


CAMERA MOVES THROUGH CLOSED DOORS TO INTERIOR. We see a long 

line of Prisoners (20). For some reason they are all holding 

money in their hands. Line ends at a desk. Seated at the 

desk, in a grey, prison uniform, is number: 979345, formerly 

known to us as leo Bloom. Beside the table is a large display 

board reading:


WORLD PREMIERE 979344 and 979345


PRESENT


"PRISONERS OF LOVE"


STARRING 778629 and CO-STARRING 440123


INVEST NOW!!!! HUGE PROFITS GUARANTEED!!!


A prisoner hands Bloom money. Bloom counts it and puts it 

into tin box. He hands prisoner a receipt.


BLOOM

Twenty-five dollars. Here's your 

receipt. You now own 28% of "Prisoners 

of Love."


CAMERA PANS TO STAGE. The stage is filled with a line of 

convict "chorus girls." Their trousers rolled up above their 

knees, showing an assortment of interesting hairy legs.


At the piano, knocking out the lively rhythm, is Franz 

Liebkind and his ever popular german helmet.


On stage directing the rehearsal is the indomitable max 

Bialystock.


BIALYSTOCK

(waving his cane and 

shouting at the top 

of his lungs)

Higher, you animals, higher! We open 

Saturday night! Kick! Kick! Two-three-

kick-turn! Two-three-kick-turn! Okay, 

let's hear it!


The Prisoners break into song.


PRISONERS

(singing)

"We're prisoners of love, etc."


Music swells to crescendo.


CAMERA PULLS BACK TO ENCOMPASS THE ENTIRE STAGE AS


"THE END"


AND SUBSEQUENT TECHNICAL CREDITS APPEAR ON THE SCREEN.
