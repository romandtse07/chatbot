Stan Lee












First Draft

November 24,1985


For Cannon Films

Sunset Boulevard

Los Angeles, CA  90028




INT.  BASEMENT - DAY


A single glistening strand of a spider's web bisects the

BLACK FRAME.  As CLASSICAL MUSIC caresses our ears, we see

the strand criss-crossing others in a perfect orb web.  A

spider-- black with an intricate pattern-- drops INTO FRAME.

It gracefully gathers and weaves the strands together.


The web and spider become small, a gray mass against a

basement ceiling corner. The  further BACK we go, the grimier

the scene becomes:   peeling industrial green paint, tangles

of pipes and electrical cable, harsh lighting.


We hear a low WHIR, the pitch growing higher-- a cyclotron. 

The colossal donut-shaped accelerator dominates the basement

lab.  It's a cylindrical, metallic tube, suspended from the

ceiling, with wires and fixtures over its length. 

Utilitarian, a patchwork of technology from the 40s to the

80s, with radioactivity warnings.




INT.  EXPERIMENTAL CHAMBER - DAY


A steel and glass chamber is built around and below a section

of the cyclotron.  Metal shelves of equipment, a large

electrical transformer with heavy cables leading to it from

the floor.


A three-fingered mechanical claw-- a "waldo"-- thrusts INTO

FRAME. Its telescoping arm extends, lifts a tiny one-gram

cylinder from a rack of standard weights on a shelf.  Another

waldo holds a lead canister, a third removes a sealed vial

containing a thick, muddy liquid.  A fourth arm reaches up to

adjust a crystal focusing cone, which juts out from  the

cyclotron tube.  The arm aims the cone at a digital scale on

a table in the center of the room.


The four waldos are mounted on a panel with a thick, clear

pane above it.  Through the glass, a shadowy figure

manipulates the controls.  A fibrous BLUE-WHITE BEAM erupts

from the cone, focusing on the weight & the TITLES END.




INT. CONTROL ROOM - DAY


The WHIR is muffled now, the MUSIC loud from a stereo in the

control room. A video monitor shows a waldo placing the gram

weight on a scale; a digital read-out beside the screen jumps

from 0.000000 to 1.000000. A computer screen displays

irregular, colored patterns describing the downward arcs of

sub-atomic particles.  A digital clock:  8:57 AM.  A half

eaten chili dog lies on the control panel.


DR. OTTO OCTAVIUS ("DOC OCK") manipulates the waldo controls. 

In his 50s, Ock is broad, thickly-featured, brooding, with

unfashionably long hair. He wears a stained sweatshirt,

protective goggles. Without interrupting his concentration,

he lights a fresh cigarette from the butt of the last, and

takes a bite of the chili dog.




INT.  BASEMENT HALLWAY - DAY


ALEXANDER THORKEL and SOLOMON ROSOMOFF (ROZ) enter from a

flight of stairs.  Tall, thin, 40, Thorkel wears horn-rimmed

glasses and a Brooks Brothers suit.  Roz, a professor of

astrophysics, walks spryly despite his 75 years. The men head

to the door at the end of the hall:  "CYCLOTRON, AUTHORIZED

PERSONNEL ONLY."


THORKEL

I'm sorry to bother you, Professor. 

But the man is impossible.


ROZ

He has his reasons, Thorkel.  At

the moment, he has something to

prove.


THORKEL

He refused to open the door.


ROZ

Maybe he didn't hear you knock.


Thorkel snorts.  Roz fishes a card-key from his tweeds,

inserts it into the lock.




INT.  CONTROL ROOM - DAY


The door buzzes open.


THORKEL

You'll be late for class, Dr.

Octavius.


Roz sighs.  Ock doesn't turn around.  Thorkel snaps the MUSIC

OFF.


THORKEL

The University pays you to teach.


Ock twists a dial, the WHIR increases in pitch, the light

grows more intense. Thorkel frowns.  Ock notices Roz-- a look

of understanding between them.


ROZ

Otto, I don't like Thorkel any more

than you do.  But he has got a

point.


OCK

Rosomoff, I have better things to

do than teach Introductory Physics

to mindless adolescents.


ROZ

Perhaps. But every now and then

someone pays attention.  You did.


Thorkel looks at his watch.  Ock sighs and snaps a switch.




INT.  EXPERIMENTAL CHAMBER - DAY


The four waldos pull backward and hang limply. The WHIR winds

down.




EXT.  7TH AVENUE - DAY


The DIESEL ENGINE of a bus winds down as it pulls up.  The

doors HISS open.  Sneakered feet bound down the bus steps

INTO FRAME, onto the sidewalk.  The young man in the

sneakers, PETER PARKER, passes a bank clock that reads 9:02.

Intelligent, 20, with dark hair and rimless glasses, Peter is

neither a nerd nor a male model.  Drably dressed in jeans and

a button-down shirt, he carries a book-filled backpack over

one shoulder, a Styrofoam cup of coffee in the opposite hand.

Yawning, he hurries down the avenue.




EXT.  GREENWICH VILLAGE STREET - DAY


Peter heads down a side street toward an institutional

building. A sign reads:  "CURTIS CONNORS SCIENCE CENTER," and

below, "Empire State University."  Soot, not ivy, covers the

brick walls.




INT.  SCIENCE CENTER LECTURE HALL -DAY


Looking down over tiers of built-in chairs to a podium and

blackboard flanked by doors.  Somber, traditional academia. 

The half-filled class settles as Peter enters and looks up

toward the higher rows.


A weird kid in the first row-- HARRY OSBORN -- waves at

Peter. Slight and awkward, Harry has nervous mannerisms and a

garish heavy metal T-shirt.


HARRY

Hiya Peter!


Peter gives him a perfunctory wave.  He climbs up toward the

back row, where LIZ ALLEN sits with feet on the empty chair

in front of her, seemingly absorbed in a dog-eared Jane

Austin novel. Her style reflects a quirky sense of humor: 

floppy hot-pink sweater over a brilliant purple dress;

brightly-striped knee socks with clashing ballet slippers;

colorful jewelry.


Liz is the single bright spot in this otherwise drab

environment.  Without looking up from her book, she folds her

legs up for Peter to pass.  He sits discretely one seat away

from her, lays his backpack beside her.  Peter eyes Liz over

his coffee, clearly pleased to see her.


PETER

Good morning, Liz.


LIZ

How very dull, Peter Parker.


PETER

It's too early to be clever.


She unzips his backpack and toys with his Nikon.


LIZ

It's never too early to be clever. 

Describe in a sentence how you feel

about me.


PETER

Huh?


LIZ

Fill in the blank: "I blank

Elizabeth Allan."


PETER

I-- uh--


LIZ

Uh is a good start.


PETER

I lov-loathe Elizabeth Allan.

Abhor, detest, despise--


LIZ

Oh.  Well, I hate you and everyone

who looks like you.


Down below, Doc Ock rumbles in, cigarette dangling from his

lips, and slams his notes down on the podium.  There's a "NO

SMOKING" sign behind him.  He starts his lecture as Liz and

Peter continue their rapid parry and thrust.


PETER

I hate the Platonic idea of you.


LIZ

I hate people with alliterative

names.


PETER

I hate--


LIZ

I hate your relatives, I hate your

coffee, I hate your shoes.


OCK

(barely audible; BG)

As you'll doubtless recall, there

are four known forces in the

universe--


PETER

Not my coffee.


She puts his camera down and grabs his cup, takes a sip.


LIZ

No.  I was lying about the coffee.


PETER

Thank God.


Liz looks deep into his eyes.  It's the first time she's

looked at him.


OCK (CONT., OS)

The strong force, which binds

matter together; the weak force,

which causes decay;

electromagnetism; and gravity--


LIZ

(melodramatic)

I was lying about it all, Peter.  I

love you. 

Ever since the third grade, I've

loved you, I've wanted you. I dream

of you, night and day, my very

being o'erbrims with a burning

passion for you.


Peter wishes this were true.  Suddenly FLASH THOMPSON dips

INTO FRAME and covers Liz's mouth in a wet kiss.  Peter looks

away, grossed out.


OCK (CONT.)

-- gravity, Newtonian theory uses a

simple equation with a constant--


Flash dumps the pack on Peter's lap, then climbs into the

chair beside Liz and throws his arm around her.  She tries to

catch Peter's eye, as if to apologize-- but he avoids her

look.


OCK

-- which we all know by heart--

Don't we, Mr. Thompson!


Flash grabs Peter's notes without missing a beat, holds them

out of view and reads.


FLASH

Natch, Doc.  That's... 6.670 time

10 to the negative eleventh.


OCK

(eyeing him)

In what quantity?


Flash tries to decipher the hidden notes.


HARRY

Meters cubed over kilogram-seconds

squared!


Flash curls his lip.  Peter retrieves his notes, clucks his

tongue at Flash.


PETER

Crime doesn't pay, Flash.




INT. READING ROOM - DAY


Early afternoon.  The long tables of the oak-paneled library

are crowded with studying students.  A print of a fox hunting

scene hangs above a mantelpiece.  A fat male LIBRARIAN sits

at a desk.

We DOLLY IN to pick out Peter Parker, slouching in a chair

with a notebook in his lap. He sniffs something, looks

around, and sees:


HARRY in the stacks, dragging a small cloth bag over the

floor and bookshelves.


Peter rolls his eyes.  Harry crosses to the table at the far

end from Peter,  He slides the squirming bag down the table

like a whiskey glass in a saloon.  Peter grabs the bag in mid

slide, shakes his head "No," silently but firmly.  Harry

grins crazily and nods, Oh,  yes!"  Sensing mischief, the

librarian glances up.  Peter heads into the stacks with the

bag, pursued by Harry.  They whisper:


PETER

You maniac.  You'll blow your

scholarship.


HARRY

They'll never take me alive.


Peter ducks as the librarian passes.  Harry snatches the bag

back, artistically swipes the man's rump with it.  The

librarian doesn't notice.


PETER

What's in there?


HARRY

A little bunny I saved from

dissection.


PETER

Harry!


Roz walks past, looks at Peter, who waves nervously.


ROZ

Mr. Parker.


PETER

Hi, Professor.  What's up?


Harry scrambles atop stack "H-K" by a window.  A tape deck

sits at the ready.


ROZ

You tell me.


Roz sees Harry signal out the window--




EXT.  LIBRARY - DAY


A van marked "RUTLAND'S COMPLEAT HUNTER"  parked by the

steps.  Two men in red hunting jackets return Harry's signal

and open the van doors.




INT.  READING ROOM - DAY


Harry clicks on the tape player-- a HUNTING TRUMPET, rousing

everyone in the library.


A dozen baying basset hounds rush in, following the scent

over tables, under chairs, upsetting everything in their

wake.  Pandemonium:  students laugh, applaud, some join in

the chase.  Dogs pursue the librarian, who falls, overturning

a bookcase.  Peter smiles in spite of himself.  Roz claps.


From atop his bookcase, Harry watches it all proudly.  The

scent bag's still in his hand.  The dogs pick up on it,

leaping and yelping at him.




EXT.  WASHINGTON PARK - DAY


Late afternoon.  Peter and Liz cross the park toward a

pretzel vendor.


PETER

-- but the dogs treed him between

Huxley and Kafka.


LIZ

Poor Harry.  Always desperate for

attention.  What about the bunny?


PETER

Back to the lab.  Harry'll probably

lose his scholarship.


Peter pays for two pretzels-- two dollars and no change. He

winces a little.  She takes a bite of pretzel.


LIZ

He'll weasel out of trouble. 

Again.


PETER

Maybe.  I could have stopped it,

though.


LIZ

Since you're feeling guilty, why

not donate your pretzel to somebody

who needs it?


She gestures over her shoulder toward a derelict.  A tacky,

blatantly sexual woman in her early 20s-- KIM-- wiggles past

the bum in question.


PETER

My my.


LIZ

Yeah.  Really gets to you if you

let it.


Liz looks past Peter into the distance.


PETER

I suppose.


LIZ

You want to give them something,

but they'll just buy more Ripple. 

And they smell so... bad.


PETER

What?


Peter looks at Liz, puzzled and amused.  She waves toward the

Washington Square arch, where Flash gets out of his double

parked MG. His eyes follow Kim's rear, he pants lasciviously.


LIZ

God, Flash can be such a jerk.


PETER

But you like that in a man?


LIZ

You should write that one down.


PETER

"Flash," Liz.  You're going out

with something that calls itself

"Flash."


LIZ

Some prep school thing.


PETER

Does it have a human name?


LIZ

Eugene.  Admit it, Peter-- you'd do

anything for a nickname like

"Flash."


PETER

I'd never admit that.


LIZ

Hurry up, Flash!


She stops. She looks at Flash, then back at Peter.


LIZ

What are you doing this weekend?


PETER

I've gotta study.


LIZ

Oh. Maybe I should, too--


FLASH

Lizzy!


LIZ

I was sort of hoping to get out of--


FLASH

I'm parked illegally!


Liz purses her lips, then hurries to Flash, gets into his

car.  As the MG speeds away, she turns in the passenger seat,

watching Peter recede into the distance.




EXT.  BUGLE OFFICES -DAY


A 1940s office building, the kind with pitted linoleum and

smelly elevators.  A  faded plastic sign in a fourth floor

window reads "THE BUGLE, NEW YORK'S FAVORITE TABLOID."


JAMESON (VO)

No.  No.  Forget it.




INT.  JAMESON'S OFFICE - DAY


A hand sorts through 8x10 b&w photos:  a bag lady with a

shopping cart--


JAMESON

Too artsy.


Peter looks over Jameson's shoulder, collecting the rejects

in mounting frustration. Next is a wacky sign, such as

"HAPPIE FUNERAL HOME--"


JAMESON

Too dumb.


Peter makes a gesture as if to throttle Jameson.  The next

photo shows a mohawked punk in a business suit with a

briefcase--


JAMESON

Too hip.  Your photos suck, kid.


PETER

I think you're trying to tell me

something.


J.JONAH JAMESON is 50, greying, sour-faced, cigar-chewing. 

Unlike the gruff-but-benign stereotype, publisher Jameson is

a bastard to the last.  Framed photos of celebrities,

biological freaks and aliens line the walls.  Papers and

rotting coffee cups clutter his ratty desk; sluggish activity

out in the main office.  The feel is cynical exhaustion:  the

Bugle is the dregs of the newspaper world


BETTY, Jameson's 30-ish assistant, enters with a layout on

boards. She looks Peter over.  Peter doesn't notice, holding

up the bag lady photo.


PETER

Think of the cutline:  "Bag lady

makes millions recycling cans!"


Betty grins; Jameson considers it, then shakes his head.  He

signs the boards "JJJ."


JAMESON

Bring me some stuff that'll grab

the morons, something like, like--


Jameson holds up the front-page board, featuring a bus

teetering on abridge, with a huge headline, 'BUS PLUNGE KILLS

20."  He grins proudly.


PETER

Come on, that's pure luck!  The guy

was in the right place at the right

time--


JAMESON

You make your own luck, Parker! Get

into the middle of things, spend

every day pounding the pavement of 

the city's mean streets--


BETTY

But you're a full-time student,

right?


PETER

My scholarship only covers books

and tuition, so I've got to

freelance to--


JAMESON

Save the chit-chat for the singles'

bar.  Now out, both of you.


Betty sticks her tongue out at Jameson and opens the door for

Peter.




EXT.  PETER'S APARTMENT BUILDING - EVENING


A seedy East Village walk-up.  Peter collects his mail,

unlocks the outside door.




INT.   PETER'S HALLWAY - EVENING


Panting, Peter climbs the last flight to his studio loft,

muttering at his bills.  At the head of the stairs, he stops. 

His door is ajar.  He takes a deep breath, clutching the keys

between his fingers as a weapon.


PETER

There's nothing in there worth

stealing!


MAY

(from within)

That's the understatement of the

year.




INT. PETER'S APARTMENT - EVENING


A one-room, eaved apartment, a chaos of books and papers.  A

photo enlarger and darkroom baths in kitchen pots; 8x10s

tacked to the walls; a spare camera and lenses.  Self

consciously wacky kitsch: plastic dinosaurs, wind-up toys, a

stuffed carp. 

An unmade bed and a 50s dinette set are the only furniture. 

A grimy skylight leads to the roof.  It's not a pretty place,

but it has personality.


A slim, sharp-featured woman in her 50s kneels by the stereo--

AUNT MAY.  In stylish slacks and jacket, she radiates vigor

and poise.  Peter enters, tosses his backpack and bills on

the formica table.


PETER

Aunt May, you're trespassing.


MAY

Your records are older than you

are.  Have you never heard of new

wave?


Peter sprawls in a plastic chair.  May shrugs and settles for

a Beatles album.  Moving fast, she crosses toward him, leans

to kiss his forehead and stops, stares, points at a pimple

near his hairline.


PETER

When I moved out, you swore up and

down you wouldn't meddle--


MAY

Oh, Peter. A zit.


Annoyed, he brushes his hair over the offending spot.  May

crosses lithely to the kitchenette, where a grocery bag sits

on the counter.


MAY

I wasn't meddling.  I was just so

desperately bored I thought I'd

come over and make you dinner--


She tosses him a fresh apple from the bag, he bites a chunk

out of it.


PETER

I am old enough to--


MAY

--but I didn't feel like getting to

know your roaches.


PETER

I'll introduce you.


MAY

Ick.  And those foul chemicals in

the pots--


PETER

I'm a photographer, remember?


MAY

Anyway, I've decided to kidnap you

for dinner in Forest Hills--


She grabs her coat, crosses to Peter and tugs on his

shoulder.


PETER

It's Friday night...


MAY

Yes.  Do you have a date?


PETER

No.


She pulls his chair toward the door, he gets up,laughing.


PETER

The record--


MAY

(already in the hallway)

It'll shut itself off.




INT.  EXPERIMENTAL CHAMBER - NIGHT


A waldo withdraws from the gram weight.  The cyclotron WHIRS,

light beams down on the tiny metal cylinder from a crystal

focusing cone.




INT.  CONTROL ROOM - NIGHT


Ock chain-smokes, half-watching the colored particle

patterns, scribbling notes. Quick readouts:  "80% ENERGY

CAPACITY," "STANDARD PARTICLE ACCELERATION," etc.  The mass

remains stable at 1.0000000.  The clock reads 6:34.




EXT. SCIENCE CENTER - NIGHT


Thorkel and  WORKER with a tool belt enter the red-brick

building.




INT. CONTROL ROOM - NIGHT


On the computer screen, a single streak glows red and arcs

upward with a musical TONE.  A readout:  "PLEASE AVOID SYSTEM

OVERLOAD. THANK YOU."  Ock twists a rheostat to crank up the

power.  More red streaks and TONES.  The readout:  "NEGATIVE

GRAVITATION ACHIEVED."


Elation fills Octavius. He stands up and takes a deep breath.

The digital mass counter fluctuates between 1.0000000 to

0.9999999.




INT.  BASEMENT HALLWAY - NIGHT


Thorkel and the worker walk down the hall.  ANIMAL NOISES

from behind a door.




INT.  CONTROL ROOM - NIGHT


Ock stands, arms crossed.  The read-outs are normal again: no

TONES, no mass fluctuation. Thorkel enters, shielding his

eyes.  Octavius turns, lifts his goggles.


OCK

Ha.  Anti-gravitational particles.


THORKEL

Power down.  I need to talk to you.


OCK

Proof.  Proof of a unified field. 

Not just theory and equations--

experimental proof.


THORKEL

Let's talk in the hall.




INT.  BASEMENT HALLWAY - NIGHT


The worker crouches, unscrewing a panel near the door. 

Ignoring this, Octavius crosses to Thorkel, a few yards from

the door.


OCK

In this obsolete little cyclotron,

I'm solving the greatest physics

problem of the 20th Century.  With

more power, I could--


THORKEL

I've had an extremely bad day,

Octavius.  A sophomoric prank in

the library and punitive measures.


Behind them, the worker continues.  Thorkel glances at him,

keeps stalling.


THORKEL (CONT.)

Then the alumni reports came in--

fund-raising is down this year.


OCK

I couldn't care less.  What I've

done is--


The worker looks at Thorkel and nods, walks off.  Thorkel

follows.


THORKEL

What you've done is make the entire

physics department look foolish. 

You compare yourself to Einstein;

your colleagues compare you to Bozo

the Clown.


OCK

This is the unified field!  All the

forces of the universe tied

together-- perfectly!


Thorkel pauses at the foot of the staircase, his voice echoes

down the hall.


THORKEL

You've used up your grant. The

electric bills alone exceed your

annual salary.  Not to mention the

potential hazards of your

radioactive fuel.


OCK

I don't care.

(under his breath)

Cretin.


Ock crosses back to the cyclotron door, pulls out his card

key.


THORKEL

You're denied access to the

cyclotron.


The lock spits out Ock's card, a red light flashes once.  He

stares at it in disbelief.


OCK

You changed the lock.


Thorkel heads up the stairs.  Anger wells up in Ock.


THORKEL

That Nobel Prize will just have to

wait.


OCK

No!


He bangs his fist on the door, causing the unseen lab animals

to SCREAM.




INT.  MAY'S LIVING ROOM - NIGHT


The sound of FANS SCREAMING on a TV baseball game.  A

refrigerator SLAMS O.S.


Peter sits on the couch, feet propped on a coffee table.  The

lower-middle-class home reflects May's personality:  her own

odd landscapes on the walls, crude sculptures, macramé

hangings.  There is too much furniture:  an agglomeration of

once-trendy pieces dating from the 40s to the present.


BEN enters from the kitchen, a can of beer in each hand.  Ben

is 60, happily overweight, a gentle, good-natured working

stiff with a mild Brooklyn accent.  He wears trousers, sports

shirt and slippers.


BEN

Here you go, Pete.


PETER

Uh, Uncle Ben, I--


BEN

(solicitous)

What, want a glass?


PETER

No. No, that's okay.


Ben sits back in his comfy chair in the corner, with a

magazine rack, a row of pipes, and a print of dogs playing

poker.  He pops open his beer.


BEN

So, uh... how's college goin'?


PETER

Same old stuff.

(beat)

How's the pharmacy?


BEN

Ah, ya know.  Neighborhood's not

what it used to be.  Kid no more'n

five swiped a candy bar the other

day.


PETER

You stop him?


BEN

Wasn't worth gettin' upset over a

Milky Way.  Anyways, I was never

much for, ya know, discipline.


PETER

I know.  Still thinking about

retiring?


BEN

Eh.  If I ever get out from under. 

Maybe take May to France or

somethin'.


An awkward pause; they both know it'll never happen.  They

look at the TV.


BEN

Ya still follow the Mets, Pete?


PETER

Nonot really.


BEN

S'funny.  When your mom and dad,

uh, passed away, I had this idea. 

I wanted you to be the best

baseball player in the world.


PETER

Remember Little League?


BEN

Yeah, Babe Ruth you wasn't.


They laugh.  Another awkward pause. Peter pops open his beer,

sips it distastefully.


BEN

Ya set for, uh, ya know-- money?


PETER

Oh, sure.


BEN

Cause if you get in a bind--


PETER

No, no.


BEN

Yeah, ya like to do things on your

own

(beat)

I been thinkin' lately.  Maybe I

wasn't the, ya know, greatest dad--


PETER

Oh, come on, Ben ,that's not--


BEN

-- no, I mean... we... your Aunt

May not wantin' kids and all... I

mean we both...


The front door opens.  May enters with a pizza box, looks at

Ben's expression.


MAY

You're not getting maudlin again.


She crosses to the kitchen.  Peter looks relieved.


BEN

When you won that scholarship, I

was proud of you.


PETER

I know.


BEN

I'm always here, Pete.


May re-enters, playing an imaginary violin.  She flips off

the TV,  crosses back to the kitchen. Peter and Ben follow,

Ben pats Peter's shoulder.




INT.  MAY'S KITCHEN - NIGHT


Copper pots, strings of garlic. On the table sits a plastic

photo cube, full of shots of Peter:  baby, cute kid, geeky

high schooler with glasses and braces.  May gets paper

plates; Peter stares into the pizza box; Ben opens the fridge

for another beer.


PETER

What the hell is that?


MAY

Tofu.  Ben, I wish you wouldn't.


Peter watches Ben as they all sit down to eat.  Ben opens the

can.


BEN

I like beer. Helps take the edge

off around here.


Peter changes the subject, points to his geeky high school

photo.


PETER

Oh, not that.  You promised you'd

burn it.


MAY

You were adorable.

(to Ben)

The least you could do is use a

glass.


Ben sighs and reaches for a piece of pizza.


MAY

Absolutely no class.


PETER

Funny thing happened after my

physics class today. Harry Osborn--


MAY

(to Ben)

Use a fork.


Ben puts down the pizza, looks at May.


BEN

Okay, I'm a slob. Ya sorry you

married so far beneath you?


MAY

What do you think?


Silence.  May looks at Peter.


PETER

A match made in heaven.


MAY

(softening)

See?  You big dullard.


Ben smiles; May smiles back.  Peter isn't smiling.  He's

refereed too often.




EXT.  FDR DRIVE - NIGHT


Ock's aged Dodge Dart speeds toward downtown Manhattan.




INT.  OCK'S CAR - NIGHT


In an alley near E.S.U. a parked car, littered with garbage,

school papers, crushed cigarette packs. On the cracked vinyl

seat lie the remains of several chopped-up credit cards, all

reading "OTTO OCTAVIUS."  Ock's hands run a magnet over the

scotch-taped composite stripe on a ESU card-key.




EXT.  SCIENCE CENTER - NIGHT


Two physics grad students-- gawky STEVE and Asian LUCY--

leave the building, laughing. Roz, smiling, locks the door on

the way out.


STEVE

-- from that paper you'd think he

had an IQ well below plant life--


LUCY

The theory isn't all that stupid. 

Just sort of inelegant, and ugly,

and--


Ock climbs up the steps-- the laughter stops immediately.


STEVE

Hey, Doc Ock! Speak of the devil!


ROZ

(over him)

Otto, Otto!  Do join us. 

Chianti and pasta at Anna's. 

Remember that night after your

orals when I--


OCK

No.  No thank you.  I have work.


ROZ

I heard about Thorkel's order--


OCK

I left a paper in my desk.


STEVE

You're not planning to publish it,

I hope?


With a look, Roz silences the grads' laughter.  Ock pays them

no mind anyway, goes up the steps and enters the building.

Roz leads the students away, glancing back at Ock with

concern.




INT.  BASEMENT HALLWAY - NIGHT


Ock crosses to the cyclotron door, inserts the jerry-rigged

card-key.  The lock rejects it.  He scratches at the stripe

with a house key, reinserts it-- rejected.  Ock looks around

furtively, pushes and holds it in.  This time, a green light

goes on and the door unlatches.




INT. EXPERIMENTAL CHAMBER-NIGHT


The cyclotron WHINES, the BEAM erupts from the focuser onto

the weight.


Crawling on the crystal cone we see the spider from our

opening image.




INT.   CONTROL ROOM


Red patterns on the computer screen, with accompanying TONES. 

The digital readout dips below 1.0, flashing slowly

descending numbers.  A strange, distinctive THROB grows

louder.  Readout:  'APPROACHING NEGATIVE MASS."   Ock watches

the chamber intently, thrilled. "OVERLOAD-- SHUT DOWN NOW,

PLEASE."  Instead, Ock increases power.




INT.  EXPERIMENTAL CHAMBER


The spider drops on a web strand toward the weight, which

PULSATES weirdly.




INT. CONTROL ROOM


The mass indicator nears zero. A voltmeter swings into

overload, a warning ALARM sounds, readout:  'OVERLOAD--

DAMAGE MAY RESULT," then:  'SYSTEM ERROR -- SYSTEM ERROR--

SYSTEM ERROR."  The warnings fill the screen.


On the monitor, the gram weight PULSES, the THROB gets

louder.  The spider drops inches from it.  Ock, annoyed,

seizes the waldo controls to swipe at the descending spider.




INT.  EXPERIMENTAL CHAMBER


A waldo swipes at the spider.  Sensing this, the spider

drops, alighting on the glowing gram weight.




INT.  CONTROL ROOM


The mass readout jumps from 0.00000133 up to 1.77349012.  On

the monitor, the weight spins off the scale.  In rapid

succession:


-- All the dials and readouts go mad, the computer screen

IMPLODES.


-- Ock's eyes open wide, his face registers ecstasy.


-- The control room glass turns to fluid, sucked into the

chamber.


-- A yard-wide hole rips open in the cyclotron tube.


-- Ock is thrust against the controls, his shirt rips away.


-- The waldos flail madly, steel walls buckle like rubber.


-- Wires snap, shooting sparks, cyclotron pipes squirm and

bend like snakes.


-- The PULSING light slashes through everything




INT.  BASEMENT HALLWAY


-- The light penetrates the walls from the cyclotron room


-- Doors bang open and closed, carts of chemicals spin.  Lab

animals SCREAM.


-- Walls and objects warp together, surrealistic.




INT. EXPERIMENTAL CHAMBER


As suddenly as the EFFECTS began, they cease.  DEAD SILENCE.


The spider, glowing slightly, scuttles across the floor.




INT.  CONTROL ROOM


TIGHT ON OCK, lying on the floor in the eerie, dim light.  He

opens his eyes.


The room around him looks melted:  dials, monitors and

switches distorted as in a fun-house mirror; a chair fused

into a wall, the door twisted, rippled.


Ock looks down, fascinated.


The extended metallic waldo tentacles curl on the floor.  We

follow the length of one of them to its new source.  It joins

with Ock's torso.


All four waldos penetrate the flesh of Ock's bare chest and

belly.  Octavius SHRIEKS.




INT.  BASEMENT HALLWAY


Warped and weird.  Ock's SCREAM echoes and dies.




EXT. SCIENCE CENTER - DAY


Undamaged on the outside, surrounded by NYPD patrol cars,

fire trucks, sedans marked "Nuclear Regulatory Commission,"

EPA vans and a single ambulance. Police search Ock's Dart as

a tow truck prepares to take it.  Construction workers erect

plywood barriers around the building, over windows.


Police lines holdback a crowd of reporters, students and

gawkers. J.

Jonah James himself pushes to the front of the throng.  Two

guards hustle out to a NEWS PHOTOGRAPHER. Jameson collars the

man.


JAMESON

Get anything good?


The photographer shakes his head.  Jameson flings his cigar

to the sidewalk. Ashen, Thorkel exits the Science Center,

addresses the crowd.


THORKEL

Please, all of you go home! 

There's nothing to report here!


JAMESON

That's a load a' crap!


A barrage of AD LIB questions:  "We heard there was an

explosion!"  "Was it terrorism?" "A nuclear accident?"  "A

meltdown, was it a meltdown?"


THORKEL

No, no, no, please--


JAMESON

I bet it was genetic engineering! 

You guys makin' mutants in there?


Peter, curious, makes his way toward Jameson.


THORKEL

There was a boiler explosion. Only

minor damage--


REPORTER

Why the ambulance?  Who was hurt?


THORKEL

Just-- just a custodian-- we

haven't as yet reached the family--


JAMESON

Was he killed?


THORKEL

No. No, please.  Nothing more I can

say at this time.


Thorkel re-enters the building.  Police hold reporters back,

AD LIB QUESTIONS.


PETER

You taking extension classes, Mr.

Jameson?


JAMESON

Parker-- you go here, right?  Got

your camera?


PETER

Yeah--


JAMESON

Get inside and get pictures.  Fifty

bucks.


PETER

Can we make it a hundred?


JAMESON

Seventy.  But I want blood and

gore.  You know, sexy stuff.


Peter nods, pulls his Nikon from his pack and hands the pack

to Jameson.




EXT.  SCIENCE CENTER ALLEY - DAY


Peter tears his pants on the top of a cyclone fence, falls in

a graceless heap.  Cursing, he checks the camera for damage,

gets to his feet with pain.  An unmarked white van blocks the

far end of the alley.


Afire door opens to the science center.  Peter ducks behind a

dumpster.  Two men in radiation suits carry out a small

stretcher, atop it a vision from a nightmare:  a whimpering

dog fused with a wire cage. While the men load it into the

van, Peter limps through the fire door and inside.




INT.  BASEMENT HALLWAY - DAY


Architectural angles skewed, walls and doors "melted" and re

solidified as a result of the experiment. VOICES of various

OFFICIALS filter down the hall.  Peter stays out of sight,

snapping pictures.


NYPD CAPTAIN

-- could be called burglary, but

the Department relinquishes

jurisdiction--


NRC MAN

-- practical applications for

defense--


FIRE CHIEF

-- Jesus, those animals--


Roz accompanies two paramedics wheeling a sheet-covered body

on a gurney up the hall. Peter sees that it's Ock, snaps a 

photo, then ducks into the men's room.




INT.  MEN'S ROOM - DAY


Like a Dali:  urinals compressed and stretched, porcelain

sinks twisted, stalls fused with the sloped floor and gnarled

plumbing.  Peter enters, sweeping away the strands of a

spider's web.  Through the door, he hears the gurney roll by.


PARAMEDIC #1

-- never seen nothin' so weird.


PARAMEDIC #2

Oh, I have.  In '69.  We was up in

Boston, trippin' our brains out--


ROZ

Please.


Their voices recede.  A SQUEAK at Peter's feet startles him--

he looks down to see--


A white lab rat, melded to its exercise wheel, struggling

pathetically across the tile floor.  Peter reacts, focuses

his camera on it.


Above Peter's head, the still-glowing spider drops from its

twisted web on a strand.  It lands unnoticed on his hand--

and bites.


Peter slaps his hand, but the spider drops onto the floor,

ceases to glow.  Its limbs contract in death.


Peter drops his camera as a wave of nausea hits him.  He

braces against a sink, sees his image in a twisted mirror--

drenched in sweat, his face flushed red.  A GUARD pushes the

door open behind him.


GUARD

Hey!  What the hell you doin' in

here?


PETER

I was thinking about throwing up--


The guard grabs the dazed Peter and hustles him out.




EXT. SCIENCE CENTER - DAY


The guard pushes Peter out the door.  SOUNDS of the crowd and

city are a muddled roar to Peter. And he's not limping

anymore.


PETER

My ankle doesn't hurt--


GUARD

Good for you.  Stay outta here.


The guard shoves him past the police line, where Jameson

approaches him.


JAMESON

Okay, kid, what you got?


Peter, dizzy, tries to rewind his film. In BG, medics load

Ock into the ambulance.


PETER

Can't focus...


JAMESON

Gimme that.  Pick it up later.


He snatches the camera, stuffs it in Peter's backpack, heads

off.  Peter lifts his glasses to rub his eyes.


PETER'S POV:  The world comes into sharp, precise focus.


Peter shakes himself, looks through the glasses again, then

puts them in his pocket.  He heads unsteadily down the

street, away from  the dwindling crowd.




EXT. GREENWICH VILLAGE STREET - DAY


Still woozy, Peter starts across the street.  The ambulance

barrels toward him--


The SIREN suddenly WAILS above the urban din--


Peter turns to see the bumper only feet away--


Instinctively he jumps UP, OUT OF FRAME--


The ambulance speeds on its way.




EXT. BRICK BUILDING - DAY


CLOSE, on Peter's face, pressed against the bricks, eyes

closed, breathing hard.  He opens his eyes, regaining his

senses.  Puzzlement  then fear.  He looks down.


The sidewalk is fifteen feet below him.


He's clinging flat against the wall, palms at his sides

against the bricks.  Peter whimpers. A tremor in his hand, he

reaches to pull himself upward.


He tries for a toehold.  Brick crumbles beneath his feet, he

swings wildly, but his fingertips hold him against the

building's face.


He looks at his fingers, his hand-- the spider bite glows

faintly under his skin.


Tentatively at first, he inches upward.  With growing

confidence, he crawls up the wall to the roof of the ten

story structure.




EXT. ROOFTOP - DAY


Unlike the claustrophobic streets below, sky and space

abound.  At the ledge, Peter clutches an iron vent pipe to

pull himself up.  It crunches in his grip.  He clambers to

the flat roof and regards the pipe, the dizzying height.  He

looks around him, wondering if he's lost his mind.  He sits

down near the ledge.


PETER

This is very strange.


He rubs the back of his hand-- the glow of the spider-bite

vanishes.


Getting slowly to his feet, he stretches, flexes his muscles. 

His body feels somehow different.  He shrugs, then jumps

straight up-- about fifteen feet, as if from a trampoline. 

He lands agilely.


Confusion turns to elation.


He leaps to the roof access door, clings to it and crawls to

the top of the small shack.  New York stretches in every

direction.  The sun peeks out from behind the clouds.


Peter LAUGHS in pure exhilaration.  He leaps from the access

door, and runs at full speed across the roof, enjoying his

body. At the ledge, he leaps into space--




EXT.  NEW YORK ROOFTOPS - DAY


--and lands atop the sloped roof of the next building.  Peter

keeps jumping with the same heady freedom.


Another leap, this time pirouetting in mid-air over a 50

story drop.


The next jump, he lands upside-down on the side of a

building, clinging and kicking his feet in the air.  More

LAUGHTER.


A pre-teen PIGEON KEEPER turns from his cooing birds.  Peter

dashes by  him and leaps from the building.  Stunned, the kid

walks out of the coop, leaving the door open.  The birds fly

out in a flurry.


Peter slides down a high telephone cable across an alley

between buildings.




EXT. CONSTRUCTION SITE - DAY


Atop an unfinished building sit stacks of iron girders and

2x4s.  Peter tests his strength, imitating Bruce Lee,

attacking the boards and splintering them easily.


He leaps and grabs the hook of a construction crane, swings

on it like Tarzan.




EXT. MANHATTAN STREET - DAY


A mother wheels a two-year-old girl in an open pram past the

construction site.  The kid sucks a bottle, looks up.  The

little girl's eyes follow--


Peter swinging on the hook.  He drops and scampers down the

building's skeleton.


The little girl takes out her bottle and giggles.




EXT.  PHONE BOOTH - DAY


Peter drops a quarter into the slot of the outdoor phone bay. 

His finger finds "POISON CONTROL" on a stick-on list of

emergency phone numbers.


NURSE VOICE

(filter)

Poison emergency.


PETER

Hi.  I've got sort of a

hypothetical question.  Do you

suppose the bite of a radioactive

spider would transmit that spider's

proportional strength and agility?


NURSE VOICE

(a long beat)

Is this some sort of Zen thing?


PETER

I mean, I suddenly have immense

physical power, and the ability to

crawl up walls--


NURSE VOICE

Do ya? Lemme give you the number

for Bellevue.  That's 561-5151--


PETER

Yeah, a psychiatric hospital.

Listen, I'm serious--


NURSE

I'm sure.  They handle problems

like yours all the time.


PETER

Have a nice day.


He hangs up and crawls up the wall.




INT.  OPERATING ROOM - DAY


DR. CRAWFORD and ASSISTANTS, gowned and masked, look BELOW

FRAME at the patient-- Ock.  They attempt to remain clinical,

but we see their horror.


DR. CRAWFORD

Again, hydraulics and electronics

melded with dorsal tissue, ganglia,

organs--

(sighs)

Jesus God... this is nuts.


NURSE

Can't those things be removed

somehow?


DR. CRAWFORD

Not without killing him.


Into a tray, forceps drop a short length of cable intertwined

with nerve ganglia.


DR. CRAWFORD

Six hours to get that much.


DOCTOR #2

What was he mucking around with?




INT. EXPERIMENTAL CHAMBER - DAY


Work lights illuminate the warped room: cascades of melted

glass, a hole in the cyclotron tube, a tangle of wires and

metal at the transformer.  An NRC MAN with lead gloves and

boots explores the room.  Roz watches from the control room,

going over Ock's notes.


ROZ

Octavius' notes are pretty

impenetrable.


NRC MAN

Whatever he was up to,  it was new. 

Look.


He pushes a gloved finger into the metallic wall-- it's soft

and rubbery. Thorkel enters the control room, paces and

fiddles around.  They ignore him.


NRC MAN

This was steel


THORKEL

Unbelievable.  How do I explain

this to the trustees?


ROZ

Temperature?


NRC MAN

Cool.


THORKEL

Damn him.  Look at this, expensive

property, ruined--


He throws a switch-- nothing happens.


ROZ

Thorkel, stop that.  Radiation

levels?


NRC MAN

Normal.


THORKEL

Do you know how much this will cost

to repair?!


He angrily throws another switch-- the damaged cyclotron

SQUEALS and THROBS once, Roz pushes the stunned Thorkel away

and shuts the cyclotron off.


The NRC Man ducks as a PULSE of energy shoots from the

focusing cone to the transformer and rushes visibly along the

cables.




EXT.  RAILROAD TRACKS - DAY


El between stations, ELECTRICAL HUM of overhead wires.  The

RUMBLE of an approaching Long Island train.  The PULSE

ripples through the powerlines.




INT.  COMMUTER TRAIN -DAY


A light Saturday crowd, including the grad student Steve,

absorbed in an Epic magazine.  As usual, the stiff

suburbanites ignore one another.




EXT. RAILROAD TRACKS - DAY


Overhead lines PULSE and THROB as in the experiment.  A

mirage-like SHIMMER hangs in the air.


The commuter car whizzes forward into the shimmer and

DISAPPEARS.




INT. COMMUTER TRAIN


Through the dirty windows, the weird PULSE and THROB. The

passengers ignore it.  A few work their way to the doors for

the next stop.


A WHOOSH and a THUD as the train stops abruptly, the PULSE

dissolving into DAYLIGHT.  The doors HISS open: the

passengers look out timidly.


They see a snowy plain.  A fur-clad Mongolian peasant with a

yak stares back at them.




EXT.  MONGOLIAN WASTELAND - DAY


REVEAL the El train laying incongruously amidst the desolate

landscape.




EXT.  TIMES SQUARE - DAY


The marquees, traffic and lights.  The rolling news sign

reads:  "Long Island Train Disappears."  Perched atop the

sign high above it all, Peter scans the scene, arms folded. 

Looking down, he sees a cheesy theater sign:  'BATTLE A

MONSTER!  $1000 FOR 1 MINUTE WITH HULK HOGAN."  Contestants

line up outside.




EXT.  THEATER ENTRANCE - DAY


Beneath the marquee, a dozen large men stand in line.  CROWD

NOISE from within. Peter takes a place behind a RAMBO type in

bandanna and fatigues and a GOON wearing a narrow burglar

mask, striped shirt and cap.


RAMBO

What for da mask?


GOON

Don't wanna look stupid.


PETER

Yeah.  You might lose your

scholarship.


GOON

Zat a joke?


Peter slowly shakes his head.  He glances across the street

and spies "LIEBER'S NOVELTIES:  Toys, Jokes, Costumes."




INT. WRESTLING ARENA - DAY


THUMP.  Rambo flies down on the mat, HOGAN pins him.  The

crowd CHEERS.


Near the ring, a new-wave AMAZON official cocks her head at

Peter, who wears a rubber fly mask with huge compound eyes

and antennae.


AMAZON

Ya look kinda scrawny for this.


Peter flexes his muscles, none too impressively.  She hands

him a release form.


AMAZON

Says you won't sue us if ya get

killed.


Peter signs the release.  She reads it and shrugs.


AMAZON

Okay, Mr. Thorkel.  I trust ya.  Ya

got an honest face.


Peter bows. Rambo crawls out of the ring.  Peter bounds over

the ropes onto the mat.  Hogan looks at the fly-masked

contestant, then leads the crowd in derision.


The large, digital one-minute clock BUZZES.


Peter gestures "come hither" with both hands.  Hogan grins

evilly and ROARS, lunging across the mat, dwarfing the skinny

kid.  Peter dodges the blond giant, leaping and spinning

aside acrobatically.  The CROWD BOOS, demanding action.


At ringside near the Amazon, MAX REISS watches with interest. 

Reiss is a world-weary, balding agent, none too successful,

judging from his unpressed suit.


Hogan laughs and goes for Peter again. This time, he tosses

the wrestler-- hard. He lifts Hogan up over his head and

slams him to the mat.  Carrying the flailing giant under his

arm, Peter scales a ring post.  The clock ticks off the last

few seconds. He dangles Hogan by his boot toe, like a prize

trout.


PETER

Now tell me you love me.


HOGAN

Lemme down, bugface!


PETER

That's not even close.


Peter drops Hogan face-first on the mat as the BUZZER SOUNDS. 

The unruly crowd BOOS and HISSES.  AD LIB SCREAMS:  "Rip

off!"  "Bullshit!"  "It was fixed"


Hogan rolls over on the mat in pain, his nose bleeding. 

Peter leaps down, genuinely concerned.  He puts his hand on

Hogan's shoulder.


PETER

Are you okay?


HOGAN

(cowering)

Get away from me, freak!




EXT.  ALLEY - DAY


Still masked, Peter exits the back door, counting ten hundred

dollar bills.  The door opens again and Reiss rushes out,

fumbling for a business card.


REISS

Kid, you were terrific.  Max Reiss,

novelty acts.  Was that judo or

something?  Ah, skip it.  Question

is, can you do it again?


PETER

Oh-- I don't know-- thanks, Mr.

Reiss, but--


Peter reads the business card while Reiss sizes him up.


REISS

I dunno about the mask.  Might want

to get something sexier.  People

don't like bugs.


The door SLAMS open, Hogan strides out, bruised and furious. 

He walks over to Peter. Reiss backs off.  Hogan lumbers over

to Peter.  Two ominous beats.


HOGAN

How are you doing, kid?


PETER

Oh, look, Mr. Hogan, I'm really

sorry about what happened in there. 

Really--


HOGAN

You can be great, kid, just stick

with it. But let me give you one

little piece of advice... be a good

guy.


PETER

Right.


Hogan gives Peter a big smile and heads back into the

building.  Peter heads off, and Reiss calls after him:


REISS

My number's on the card!  Call me!




INT.  LEIBER'S NOVELTY SHOP - DAY


Toys, games, costumes everywhere.  LEIBER, a sharp-eyed man

with a suspicious twinkle, watches Peter-- still in the bug

mask -- finish a sketch:  a body suit with a web design and a

spider on the chest.


LEIBER

No refund on the mask, y'know. 

Health laws.


PETER

Uh-huh. Look, this should be

skintight.  Bright colors.  Red,

maybe a deep midnight blue.


LEIBER

What's this? A cockaroach?


PETER

A spider.  Eight legs.


Leiber looks at the fly-headed Peter, who has spotted a loud,

trendy jacket-- like a red leopard skin-- on a nearby sale

rack.  He holds it up to himself.


LEIBER

Eh.  Week from tomorrow.


PETER

How about tomorrow?


LEIBER

You're making my life difficult.


PETER

Two suits by tomorrow for $400?


LEIBER

An even five I throw in the jacket.


PETER

Deal.  But don't tell anyone.  I

want to keep a low profile.


Leiber nods seriously.  The bug-headed Peter exits, jacket in

a bag under his arm.


LEIBER

Meshuggena.




INT. OCK'S HOSPITAL ROOM- DUSK


Dr. Crawford and a BRAIN MAN stand at Ock's bedside. A snide

ORDERLY lets the sheet down on Ock's body. A sponge and pan

on a tray; wires, IVs, EEG monitors.


BRAIN MAN

Still comatose.  Alpha, beta, gamma

brain waves low, but look--


He points to an oscilloscope, tracing a lively wave.


BRAIN MAN (CONT.)

Normally there's no activity at

this wavelength.  It's like there's

a party going on in there.


DR. CRAWFORD

A malfunction?


BRAIN MAN

Well... not in the equipment.


ORDERLY

He's all washed, Doc.  Want me to

polish his chrome, too?


The doctors' icy stares cut the orderly's guffaw. They all

leave, Crawford flips off the light.  Ock remains immobile.


In the dim evening light, a metal arm rustles beneath the

sheet.




EXT. E.S.U. DORM - NIGHT


Peter, WHISTLING, takes steps two at a time into the Georgian

building,  which faces Washington Square Park (He won't wear

glasses from now on.).




INT.  E.S.U. DORM - NIGHT


Peter, looking crushed, talks with Liz's roommate ADELE, an

overweight black girl. She leans against the open door, a cat

under her arm.  The room beyond features two beds, two desks,

many plants. A big poster of Che Guevara on one side; a

Botticelli and a shelf of well-loved dolls on the other.


ADELE

I'm reading Marx to her dolls while

she's away.


PETER

New Hampshire.


ADELE

Yeah. Flash's family has a ski

cabin.  Come the revolution,

there'll be no more ski cabins.


Peter's disappointment is gut-wrenching.  He turns, and Adele

scolds herself for telling the truth.




EXT.  E.S.U. DORM - NIGHT


Peter slouches down the steps.  He kicks a garbage can. It

flies and CRASHES in the street.




INT. PETER'S APARTMENT - NIGHT


A soppy Tony Bennett SONG plays as Peter fidgets on the bed,

staring at an open astronomy text.  He gets up, grabs an

apple, then dials a memorized number.


PETER

Hi, Ben, is-- thanks... Hi, Aunt

May... Wait, you'll appreciate this

- the most bizarre thing-- Just an

apple... I know, but let me--Yeah,

fascinating... No, let me talk... I

can make the rent now...

(firmly)

Damn it, Aunt May!  Listen for

once!

(apologetic)

You know that's not what I mean...

No, you're not a cow... Right, I'm

sorry... I'm sorry!  Fine... I'll

speak to you tomorrow.


He hangs up in frustration, looks at the phone.


PETER

By the way, I got super-powers

today.


He throws the half-eaten apple toward the garbage can.  It

misses.




INT.  OCK'S HOSPITAL ROOM - DAY


Morning light spills through the window.  Rosomoff sits at

Ock's beside; Ock now sits up, wide-eyes, abnormally alert,

an unlit cigarette in his mouth.  The waldos are immobile

beneath the sheets.


OCK

Truth.  I lifted the veil. Total

inter-penetration of physical

forces-- dimensions unknown since

the birth of the cosmos!


Roz lights Ock's cigarette, eyes him dubiously.  Ock doesn't

bother to smoke it.


ROZ

A bit melodramatic but if you

could prove it that would tie in

your unified field theory, the Big

Bang, Kaluza-Klein--


OCK

Ach, theories!  This was first

hand, experiential knowledge, the

essence of the universe.


Roz begins to sense the man's madness.


ROZ

Mm.  But at what cost, Otto. You

barely survived a coma.  And look

at yourself--


Roz glances at Ock's sheeted torso.


OCK

My self.  I don't matter.  This

human life, all life-

insignificant.  Bodies-- bags of

sleepy, sluggish flesh.


ROZ

(carefully)

All right, we may be insignificant,

imperfect creatures-- but we're all

we've got.


OCK

You're wrong.  Just for a moment, I

heard, saw, felt-- I became

Creation.


Ock takes the cig from his mouth, stares at the smoldering

end.


ROZ

Creation? Or its opposite?


OCK

Truth. Pure, eternal.  Beyond the

boundaries of mere mortality.


Roz regards Ock sadly, takes the cigarette and extinguishes

it.


ROZ

Otto, we are mere mortals. You must

never forget your own limits--


OCK

I'll repeat the experiment.  I will

hold the truth. That's the only

thing that matters.


ROZ

No. It isn't.


He moves in closer, trying to see past Ock's madness.  He

speaks quietly but firmly.


ROZ

Life and death matter. Yours--

everyone's.  By comparison, our

search for truth is only a product

of curiosity, a game--


OCK

Oh, Roz.  My mind is so far beyond

yours now.

(pleased)

I could beat you at chess now.


Roz realizes Ock is beyond communication, off the deep end. A

KNOCK and Thorkel enters, smiling.


THORKEL

Gentlemen.  Professor, if you

could


Rosomoff sighs and rises.


ROZ

I was just leaving. Please, Otto. 

Be careful.


Roz exits.  Thorkel stands at the foot of the bed, leans on

the bedpost.


THORKEL

It's good to see you awake. Feeling

all right?


Ock ignores him.  Thorkel gives him a lemony smile.


THORKEL

Then you'll be glad to know the

University has decided not to press

criminal charges against you.

Breaking and entering the minor

matter of the total destruction of

a 23 million dollar cyclotron


OCK

I will finish what I've begun


THORKEL

Doubtless.  And you'll have all the

time in the world to pursue your

work.   Somewhere else.


Ock's eyes narrow.  Thorkel smiles.


THORKEL

To put it bluntly, Octavius, you're

history.  Fired, canned, out on

your ass.  The University will take

care of your medical bills, but I

consider that a small price to pay

for the pleasure of getting rid--


Without warning, a steel waldo shoots out from beneath the

sheet and clutches Thorkel by the throat.  His smirk turns

into a grimace as the arm lifts him off the floor, pushing

the man up near the ceiling.


Amazed, Ock looks along  the waldo from his chest to the

choking Thorkel. 

Ock  touches the metal arm curiously as the man gasps for

breath.  Thorkel's feet kick wildly, then go limp.  Ock drops

the body.


Ock gets out of bed, stands over Thorkel's body.  An arm

telescopes outward, the claw opens and shuts experimentally. 

Ock nods in growing pleasure.  Another arm draws the

curtains.  A third arm shoots out and clicks the door locked. 

The fourth arm delicately clicks off the electronic monitors. 

Ock clenches and relaxes his human hands, the mechanical arms

writhe like cobras.  He smiles.




INT.  SURGEON'S DRESSING ROOM - DAY


A locker room.  A fat doctor hangs up his overcoat, takes a

lab smock.  Hanging in the locker is a green and yellow

jogging suit.  As he puts the smock on, a waldo snakes around

a corner, into the locker.  It takes the overcoat and jogging

suit.




INT. MEDICAL INCINERATOR -DAY


Flames through the open grate cast weird shadows on Ock

(dressed in the overcoat and jogging suit with holes torn for

the waldos).  He grabs the grate handle, burns himself, backs

over Thorkel's glasses with a CRUNCH.  He tosses them into

the fire.  A waldo closes the grate.




INT.  PETER'S APARTMENT - DAY


In his bathrobe at the kitchen table, Peter squeezes the

contents of a tube of super-glue into a beaker, then heats

the viscous goop over a Bunsen burner, stirring it. A

microscope, several empty glue tubes, jars of thinner, and

vials of powder lie about.


Mid-day.  Peter tears open a bag from a sporting goods store,

dumps out several reels of high-strength fishing line and

boxes of miniature gas cartridges.


Afternoon. Fast-food wrappers, chemical supplies and lengths

of thin rubber tubing.  Peter uses adhesive tape to secure

his "web-shooter":  a pouch of glue under his arm; a tube

down his forearm ending with a short metal nozzle at the heel

of his hand; a watchband-thin reel of line around his wrist

with a tiny gas cartridge; a pressure-sensitive button in his

palm.


Peter extends his arm toward the far wall, bends his wrist,

presses the trigger with his middle finger.

A hideous wad of goo oozes all over his hand and explodes

through the tubing. He's grossed out.


Over the Bunsen burner again, Peter mixes more glue, thinner

this time.


Wads of failed line and glue stick to the walls like

linguini. Peter tries again.  He aims at the ceiling.  A long

stream of glue-impregnated line spits out and attaches to the

ceiling with a SPLAT.  Peter tugs at it-- it holds.  He

climbs up it, hand overhand, and hangs from the ceiling.  He

beams with success.




EXT. SCIENCE CENTER -DAY


The front door.  A waldo reaches INTO FRAME, snaps the lock

and chain with a metal claw.




INT. CONTROL ROOM - DAY


Ock[in the jogging suit from now on] surveys the damage,

flips on the cyclotron. A single blue PULSE and THROB.  The

waldos block a shower of sparks.




INT. ESU DORM -DAY


Reading Cosmo beneath a Che poster, Adele looks up.  The TV

has turned itself on, wildly flipping from channel to

channel.  From OS comes the BUZZ of Liz's blow-dryer, and a

blast of air.


The dryer levitates, whirling around, then pulls its cord

from the socket and plummets to the bed.  Freaked out, Adele

hurried to the door.


SCREAMS from the dorm rooms, students hurry into the hall and

down the steps. Light bulbs shatter, vacuum cleaners race

around, the hands of a wall clock spin crazily.




EXT. WASHINGTON SQUARE PARK - DAY


Playing chess with an aged PARTNER, Roz sees students rush

out of their dorm, some panicked, others amused. AD LIB

exclamations:  "My toaster-over attacked me!"  "What is going

on?"  "Goddamned Con-Ed!"


A kid's ghetto blaster rises from his shoulder and spins in

mid-air, then EXPLODES.


Manhole covers shiver, then spin out of the pavement like

flying saucers and hover in mid-air, then drop to  the earth

with a CLANG in unison.


Roz watches it all with scientific interest.


PARTNER

Your move.




INT. CONTROL ROOM - DAY


An electrical mess: sparks, ozone.  Ock backs away from the

sizzling control panel, a waldo throws a switch to shut the

cyclotron down. Disgusted, he storms out.




INT. PETER'S APARTMENT -DAY


Atop Peter's mattress sits an open box marked "LIEBER'S

NOVELTIES" with one Spider-Man costume inside.  Wearing  the

other costume but no mask, Peter stands before a full-length

mirror.  He tugs at the tight suit, feeling pretty silly. 

Peter pulls the mask over his face.  He puffs out his chest.


PETER/SPIDER-MAN

In this corner-- The Human Spider!

(shakes his head)

Unh-uh.  Arachnid-- Arachnia-- no.

(unsurely)

Spider-Man?


IN THE MIRROR-- the reflected image of SPIDER-MAN nods.




EXT.  PETER'S ROOF - DUSK


City lights in the distance.  Peter's range-finder camera

sits on a tripod by the open skylight.  The self-timer HUMS,

the camera CLICKS and FLASHES, catching Spider-Man in action:

swinging on web strands, clinging to walls, leaping through

the air.


Spider-Man jumps back and fiddles with the camera, then a

KNOCK from below.




INT. PETER'S APARTMENT -NIGHT


LOUD THUMPS at the door.  Spider-Man drops through the

skylight, moves to answer, then hesitates, He pulls off his

gloves and mask.  More THUMPS, rhythmic.


PETER

Cool your jets!




EXT.  HALLWAY - NIGHT


Harry sits in Peter's doorway, thumping his head backward

against the door.  As Peter, in sweater and jeans, opens the

door, the drunk kid sprawls on his back.  Harry stares

foggily at the red-webbed boots beside his face.


HARRY

Ooooh.  Your feet are on fire.


PETER

Harry


HARRY

"Harry Osborne diminishes the

stature of the University."


PETER

Let me guess.  The hunting dogs. 

You lost your scholarship.


Peter lifts Harry upright, sits cross-legged beside him.


HARRY

"Scholarship students must maintain

dignity at all times."


PETER

I know.  I've got one too.


HARRY

Screw scholarships!   Universities

are death!  They make slaves of us

all with their fetid ideas!  Burn

'em down, I say!


Peter lifts Harry up, leaning him against the doorjamb.


PETER

Great idea.  Let me get some shoes.

I'll take you home.


HARRY

Why home? The real world beckons,

man!  The possibilities are

endless.

(beat)

Want to go up to the World Trade

Center and laugh at New Jersey?


Peter, wearing shoes and a jacket, locks his door.  He leads

Harry to the stairwell.


HARRY

You're so responsible it's

disgusting. But you're my only

friend... do you hate me?


PETER

Don't be pitiful.


HARRY

I am not pitiful!  I am the bridge

to the Übermensch!


Harry goes pale, grabs his stomach.  Peter holds him by the

staircase.


PETER

Don't vomit on my shoes,

Zarathustra.




EXT. ELECTRODYNE FACTORY - DAY


A SALESMAN with a clipboard leads the overcoated Ock through

a cavernous storage hanger-- sections of aluminum pipe,

spools of wire, etc.  WORKERS and forklifts unload and stack

crates.


SALESMAN

(mumbling)

Let's see, that's 3,000 feet of 50

gauge copper armature wire... a

transformer... accelerator rails...

a few odds and ends...


Ock points to a pipe section.


OCK

And that.


SALESMAN

What's the idea? A do-it-yourself

atom smasher?

(smiles)

Couple a high school whiz kids came

in here once, plannin' to build

their own neutron bomb. Blueprints,

the whole nine yards. Wanted to be

the first ones on their block to be

the last ones on their block--


He laughs.  Ock stares at him.  He goes back to his

clipboard, clears his throat.


SALESMAN

Okey-dokey.  Then that's... uh, oh,

figure about 170,000 dollars, plus

tax.


Ock frowns at the man.


SALESMAN

Well, you do have to pay for it.


The bulge under Ock's coat moves ominously.  His face

darkens. He's about to kill the salesman-- then notices there

are too many witnesses about.


SALESMAN

Are you okay?


OCK

Money.


He turns on his heel and strides away.




INT. BUGLE NEWS ROOM - DAY


A sluggish Monday morning.  Peter enters briskly with his new

jacket slung over his shoulder, an 8x10 envelope in his hand. 

He pauses outside Jameson's door, near Betty's desk.  There's

an air of cockiness to Peter-- and Betty senses it.


PETER

Is His Eminence receiving?


BETTY

Uh-huh.  And may God go with you,

my son.




INT. JAMESON'S OFFICE - DAY


Jameson, cigar in his teeth, smiles at the bizarre photos: 

the rat melded with its cage, the distorted hallway. Peter

examines his Nikon.


JAMESON

I bet you don't think I appreciate

you, Parker.  I do.


PETER

Well, thanks.  You wouldn't believe

what I went through to get those. 

Right after you took my camera,

this ambulan--


JAMESON

I like enthusiasm.  That's why I

use a lot of smart-ass kids.  Not

just 'cause they work cheap.


PETER

Mr. Jameson--


JAMESON

I got a question, college boy.

(suddenly livid)

What the hell am I supposed to do

with these!?  I ask for disaster,

pathos, what do I get?  Salvador

Dali!  When I want artsy-fartsy

double-exposures, I'll ask for--


PETER

Double-exposures? But they're not--

I was in--


JAMESON

I don't give a gerbil's ass how you

got 'em!  I can't print this

surreal garbage!


PETER

You print pictures of Bigfoot!


JAMESON

Bunch of kids at your goddamned

college say their appliances

attacked them.  Did you get

pictures?


PETER

Mr. Jameson--


JAMESON

No! Washington Square, manhole

covers turn into flying saucers and

radios explode like A-bombs.  Did

you get pictures?


PETER

Can I get a word in edgewise?


JAMESON

No!  Now get outta my face, kid.


Jameson thrusts the photos back at Peter, who pulls the photo

from the manila envelope:  Spider-Man clinging upside-down on

a wall.


PETER

I suppose this wouldn't interest

you...


Jameson turns the photo around, trying to figure it out.  He

looks up at Peter, holds his gaze--and tears the photo in

half.  Both halves flutter into the wastebasket.




INT.  BUGLE NEWS ROOM - DAY


Peter, with his pack, quietly closes the door of Jameson's

office. Betty rises.


BETTY

How about a cup of coffee?


PETER

Yeah.  Cream and hemlock.


Peter sits on the edge of her desk as she walks off. A

thought hits him.  He pulls Reiss' business card from his

wallet and dials the number.


PETER

Hello, uh, Mr. Reiss?  I'm-- I'm

the guy who wrestled Hulk Hogan the

other day.  The guy in the mask?


REISS

(filter)

I was hoping you'd call, babe. 

Look, you got representation?


PETER

No


REISS

(filter)

Good. We'll make it oral for now.

Meet me at Rockefeller Center at

six tonight.


PETER

Why? It is a wrestling match, or


REISS

(filter)

Letterman show, NBC. We'll talk

then.  Bye.


Betty returns with his coffee.  Peter slowly returns the

receiver to its cradle.


BETTY

Good news?


Peter ignores the coffee, pulling on his new jacket, his mind

reeling.


PETER

Hey, Ma, I'm gonna be a stah...


He bangs on Jameson's window and throws him a raspberry.




EXT. SCIENCE CENTER - DAY


Boarded up and locked.  Students gather around a list of

relocated courses.  Peter finds "PSYCHICS 101-- CANCELED

UNTIL FURTHER NOTICE."




EXT.  BASKETBALL COURT - DAY


A fenced court near campus.  A vigorous game of two-on-two,

flash and three preppy pals:  NORBERT, CHIP and WINTHROP. 

Flash dribbles angrily down court, shoots, misses.  He's

pissed.


CHIP

Frustrated, Thompson?


WINTHROP

Miss Lizzy done had a headache. All

weekend long.


FLASH

Shut up!


New jacket on, Peter approaches.  He scales the wire fence

gracefully and hops onto the court, sets down his pack. They

ignore him.


PETER

Mind if I shoot a few?


CHIP

Peter, you don't play basketball.


NORBERT

We've got even teams--


FLASH

No, Norb.  Let's give Dr. J. here a

shot.


He flings the ball toward Peter, hard.


FLASH

Come on, guy.


Peter bounces the ball experimentally, then dribbles toward

the basket.


Flash nods to Winthrop, who elbows Peter and knocks the ball

away.  Flash gets it. Peter blocks Flash legally, but Flash

jumps up, makes a basket and purposely kicks Peter in the

belly.  Flash grins at Peter, who doubles over to catch his

wind.


Norb recovers the ball, passes to Chip, who passes to Peter. 

Winthrop covers him, giving him a rough time, smiling.  Peter

smiles right back, shoulders Winthrop, sending him flying

backward into Norb; they both fall backward.  Peter dashes

for the hoop.  Flash hooks Peter's ankle to trip him, but

Peter jumps up, flipping Flash to the concrete.


He leaps up for a lay-up, clinging with his fingertips to the

backboard for a second, and slam-dunks the basketball.  He

drops to earth with a spring.


PETER

Thanks, guy.


He grabs his pack, leaving by the gate.  The four preppies

stare at him.




INT.  STUDENT UNION - DAY


A super-modern cafeteria with video games, bulletin boards,

an atrium.  Alone, Peter sips his coffee, reading the Times,

the remains of a salad before him.  Liz and Adele join him

with their lunch trays.


LIZ

Eat alone, gotta read. Social

defense tactic 17

(beat)

Peter, that jacket is foul.  Lose

your glasses?


PETER

Hi, Adele.


Adele looks at him, then at Liz.


LIZ

Brrr.  It's colder than New

Hampshire in here.


PETER

I'm sure you kept warm.


ADELE

(falsetto)

Sexual tension...


LIZ

Oh, beware of jealousy, my lord,

the green-eyed monster...


PETER

Don't misquote Othello at me. 

Besides, you'd have to care about

somebody to strangle them.


LIZ

What's your problem?


PETER

I've got no problems.


ADELE

(looks at her watch)

Time to get my bowling ball re

drilled.


LIZ

Peter Parker, you have no idea what

I did this weekend.  Or didn't do. 

It's no business of yours either

way.


Peter zips up his pack, rises.


LIZ

Sit down and stop being such a

child.


PETER

This from a girl who still plays

with dolls.


LIZ

(hurt)

That wasn't clever.  That was just

nasty.


Peter heads off.  Liz dumps her glass of milk over her plate

and stifles a scream.




INT.  ROSOMOFF'S OFFICE - DAY


An old room in the library building.  Star charts and an

ancient sextant; books; a telescope; a large revolving model

of the solar system; an antique spinning wheel and a

harpsichord.  Odd, but inviting.


Roz leans over a large table, examining a precise NYC street

and subway map.  He glances at a news clipping:  "Bronx Video

Arcade Goes Tilt."  With a colored marker and a protractor,

he traces a curved line on the map through the Bronx street. 

Other waveform lines in different colors criss-cross the map.


PETER

(sings)

The Bronx is up and the Battery's

down.


Roz turns with a distracted smile.


ROZ

Peter, what can I do for you?


PETER

An extension on that astronomy

paper?  Because, uh...


ROZ

Your dog ate it.


PETER

Actually, I got this spider bite


ROZ

Pretty lame for such a smart kid.


PETER

Really, Professor, I--


Roz turns back to his map.


ROZ

You have until tomorrow.  Skip the

excuses.


Peter picks up one of the news clippings:  "'Wall Crawler'

Spotted Across NY," and another, "L.R.R.R. Train Detours to

Mongolia."  Roz notice Peter's interest.


ROZ

Fortean phenomena.  Anomalies in

our so-called reality. Weirdness,

my boy, and lots of it.


PETER

Caused by Doc Ock's experiment?


ROZ

How much do you know about it?


PETER

Not a lot.  I saw inside of the

Science Center.  What exactly

happened?


ROZ

Only Octavius knows for sure.  And

last time I spoke to him, he was on

the planet Whiz-Bang.


Lucy enters with a computer print-out.  Roz compares it with

an earlier one.


LUCY

See? With enough energy on this

side of the equation, the slope

approaches infinity.


Roz scribbles several numbers on a pad, hands the page to

her.


ROZ

Run it again with these smaller

values.


LUCY

Why bother? Nobody takes Ock's

equations seriously.


ROZ

I do.  Run it again.  Please.


She shrugs with her eyebrows and leaves.


PETER

Need any more help?


ROZ

No, thank you.  I'm sure you've got

your own problems.


Roz reviews the print-out, and, as Peter turns to leave:


ROZ

Peter... that is one godawful

jacket.




EXT. BANK - DAY


In front of the "First National Bank of Scarsdale," a

uniformed GUARD slams the steel doors of a Brink's truck.  He

climbs in the cab beside a DRIVER.


GUARD

Beers after the last pick-up?


DRIVER

Sounds good.  We'll be done in a

half-hour.


GUARD

Not at this rate.


The Driver revs the motor-- it's not moving.  The Guard

unsnaps his holster. Without warning, two waldos SMASH

THROUGH the thick glass on both sides.




EXT. BANK- DAY


Ock holds the truck aloft by the rear bumper; the rear wheels

spin.  Two other waldos surround the truck, squirming into

the cab.  GUNSHOTS and panicked SCREAMS from within.  With

his fourth waldos Ock tears open the rear door and grabs

several money bags with his hands.


In the bank, witnesses stare goggle-eyed.  A teller pulls the

drapes for protection.




INT. COMPUTER ROOM - DAY


Low ceilings, terminals, WHIRRING air conditioning, the

CLICKING of students entering data.  Roz enters,

uncomfortable and claustrophobic here.  Roz crosses to Harry

at a snazzy graphics terminal.


HARRY

I've drawn up your graphics, but...

what is this all about, anyway?


ROZ

Just a theory.  Let's see it.


Harry strikes a few keys, runs the program.


HARRY

Okay... I hope I'll get some

brownie points for this, I could

really use them...


ROZ

I'll do what I can.


ON SCREEN-- a graphic of stars in space.


HARRY

Standard chart of our cosmic

neighborhood-- and--


The graphic zooms quickly in on the solar system, Earth, then

an aerial view of the Northeastern US.


HARRY

Home sweet home. First your

original set of values--


Bluish pulses appear sporadically in a spiral in the New York

area, then stop.  Computer-generated TONES like the THROB of

Ock's experiment.


HARRY

Sporadic pulses, petering out in 96

hours or so.  But when we crank up

the energy variable, we get three

distinct phases--


He pushes a button; the screen clears and resets.


HARRY

Phase One:  the same pulses.  If

the energy input keeps rising and

we reach a critical point-- here--

into--


Spiral flashes as before. The spiral pulses multiply and

coalesce, forming a blue funnel over New York, growing and

intensifying.


HARRY

Phase Two:  An energy vacuum,

sucking power into itself.  If it

gets enough juice, we go into Phase

Three:  a chain reaction.  Here's

where it gets really good.


The image pulls back for a wider view as North America-- the

Earth-- the solar system-- then the surrounding stars implode

and dissolve into the blue pulse.


HARRY

Zzzz-Zap.  Big Bang in reverse, end

of the universe. This'd make one

hell of a video game.


Rosomoff's face registers growing dread.




INT. SUBWAY PLATFORM - NIGHT


Passengers pour out of an uptown local; a sign in BG reads

"49th ST.  ROCKEFELLER CENTER."  Peter edges away from the

crowd toward the end of the platform, looks around, then hops

down into the train bed, jogs into the tunnel.




INT.  SUBWAY TUNNEL - NIGHT


Peter looks up, then springs backward, head over heels--


--and lands upside-down, feet clinging to the grimy tunnel

ceiling. He starts to unbutton his shirt-- we see  the Spider

Man costume.  Coins fall from his pants and clang on the

rails below. Peter mutters to himself, pulls the mask over

his face.




ON PETER'S CLOTHES


Spider-Man squirts a stream of webbing to tie up the bundled

clothes.  A train approaches. Spider-Man  nonchalantly

attaches the stick bundle to the ceiling.




EXT. ROCKEFELLER CENTER - NIGHT


Spider-Man emerges from the subway, strolls toward

Rockefeller Plaza.  A pedestrian mutters, "What an asshole,"

and Spider-Man's walk becomes tentative, embarrassed.  A

child:  "Look, Mommy, the circus!" Another by-passer:

"Excellent." Spider-Man's walk becomes more self-assured.




INT. TV STUDIO - NIGHT


Backstage hubbub.  Reiss and Spider-Man wait in the wings, a

female A.D. nearby, a mix of LIVE and FILTERED SOUND from the

stage.  MONITOR shows LETTERMAN watching a "stupid human

trick," a man playing music on his teeth.


REISS

Where'd you get the clown suit?


SPIDER-MAN

Like it?


REISS

Nah.  The big mask was better.


A.D.

Ten seconds.


The A.D. leads the nervous Spider-Man toward the curtain.

Reiss watches the MONITOR, where we see Letterman reading

from a card--


LETTERMAN

But wait, there's more. For

arachnid lovers everywhere, here's

"The Amazing Spider-Man."  How

about a tacit round of applause.


ON STAGE as Spider-Man shuffles out from behind a curtain. 

The tight costume earns him surprised WHOOPS from the

audience.  Letterman shakes Spidey's hand, then winces at his

sticky palm.


LETTERMAN

Is that bug juice, or are you just

glad to see me?


SPIDER-MAN

Sorry. I'm still getting the hang

of this.


LETTERMAN

I see.  So, Amazing Spider-Man--

I'll assume that's not your given

name--


SPIDER-MAN

Just call me Spidey.


LETTERMAN

Can I get you a snack-- a housefly,

maybe?


SPIDER-MAN

Thanks, I already ate.


LETTERMAN

I'll hate myself in the morning for

asking, but what exactly makes you

any more amazing than the average

jerk on the street?


SPIDER-MAN

Well...


He leaps straight up, somersaulting in mid-air and sticks on

a Klieg light lattice.  The audience REACTS, suitably

impressed.  Letterman cocks his head.


LETTERMAN

Oh, boy.  Must come in handy for

changing light bulbs.


Spider-Man shoots a long strand of webbing to the ceiling

above the audience.


SPIDER-MAN

And for my next impression-- Errol

Flynn!


He swings out over the boggled crowd and clings to a wall. 

Even Letterman is dumbstruck, leans cross-armed against his

desk.  Spidey does a horizontal dance.


LETTERMAN

Hold it.  Are you a shill for

Velcro?


The cameras swirl to track Spider-Man as he sings back to the

stage.  Letterman sits on the edge of his desk, shakes his

head.


SPIDER-MAN

Ta-daaa!


The BAND reprises Spidey's "Ta-daaa!"  The audience CHEERS,

Spidey bows.


LETTERMAN

All right, amazing.  Are you quite

finished?


SPIDER-MAN

Just about.  You see, I also have

this amazing strength...


With one hand, Spider-Man lifts the desk-- and Letterman--

above his head.  The audience goes wild.




INT.  TV STUDIO LOBBY - NIGHT


Reiss and Spider-Man come out of an elevator, cross the lobby

to the door.


SPIDER-MAN

So they're airing this tonight?


REISS

Yup.  Oh, here's your check, minus

my commission.  Solid, solid

novelty act.


Spider-Man puts the check in his waistband. They head into

the revolving door.




EXT. FIFTH AVENUE - NIGHT


Spider-Man stands dead still outside the building, shudders--

street NOISE fades to SILENCE, TRACK IN to his face. 

DISTORTED SOUNDS:  a window SMASHING, Ben's VOICE-- "Hey,

what--"  This is Spider-Man's first experience of "spider

sense," a warning of danger.


REISS

(fading in)

... a couple a drinks at Sardi's?


SPIDER-MAN

What?


REISS

I asked if you felt like a drink--


SPIDER-MAN

(distracted)

No.  No, I-- my aunt and uncle. 

Something's wrong  --  I need to

make a phone call.


REISS

Okay, kid. Call me tomorrow.


Reiss heads off.  Spider-Man stops at a phone kiosk, picks up

the receiver--


SPIDER-MAN

Mr. Reiss-- I need a quarter--


REISS

I just gave-- yeah, sure.


He gives him the coin and walks off.  Pedestrians gawk at the

costumed figure as he quickly dials.  BEHIND HIM, across the

street, there's a cut-rate electronics store.


SPIDER-MAN

Ben, is everything all right?

...Are you sure?

(relieved)

No, I guess it was nothing-- I just

had this feeling-- no, don't wake

her up... just watch Channel 4 at

12:30--


ALARM from store in BG.  A huge and menacing THIEF races into

the street, a paper bag full of cash on one hand, a small TV

under his arm.  Spider-Man leans into the kiosk to be heard,

speaks loudly.


SPIDER-MAN (CONT.)

Right, tonight. I know it's late,

but it's worth it--I'll be on

television!  It's a long story--


An Armenian STOREOWNER chases the thief, who dodges cars and

buses and heads straight toward Spider-Man.  Brakes SCREECH,

horns BLARE.


STOREOWNER

Stop him!  Somebody stop him!


Spider-Man dodges as the thief runs right past him and

hurries down the subway. The winded Storeowner stops by

Spider-Man, cursing him in Armenian.


SPIDER-MAN (ON PHONE)

Isn't that great?  You won't

believe it...


STOREOWNER

Whatsa matter with you!


SPIDER-MAN (ON PHONE)

Okay. Okay.  See you, Ben.


He hangs up, turns calmly to the irate Storeowner.


STOREOWNER

You coulda stopped him!  Done

something-- Stuck your leg out,

tripped him-- anything!


SPIDER-MAN

Oh, gimme a break.  Do I look like

Charles Bronson?


Spider-Man walks off, leaving the Storeowner to his apoplexy.




EXT.  BANK MACHINE - NIGHT


Clothes under his arm, Spidey pulls out the check, an

impatient businessman and a fishwife behind him.


SPIDER-MAN

Can I borrow somebody's pen?


The businessman mutters, "Flake" under his breath, hands him

a pen.  He starts to sign "Peter," then flips it over.  It's

made out to "Spider-Man."


SPIDER-MAN

Wonderful.  I guess I can still

make a withdrawal.


FISHWIFE

Hey, nutbar, move it!




INT.  DISCO - NIGHT


Colored lights throb with the MUSIC.  Young trendies clap

with the beat as Spider-Man puts on a fabulous show of

acrobatic breakdancing.


In mid-move, Spider-Man freezes-- the tingle of his "spider

sense" again.  SILENCE and TRACK IN.  We hear GUNSHOTS, a

man's GROAN, distorted.


Ambient SOUNDS of the disco return.  The crowd urges Spider

Man to continue, but he pushes through them toward the bar. 

He lifts the lower portion of his mask over his nose to

finish his Coke.  KIM-- the sexpot Peter saw in Washington

Square Park--  watches him hungrily.


KIM

I love the way you move.  What made

you stop?


SPIDER-MAN

Second time tonight this weird,

weird feeling, like a kick in the

stomach


She runs her hand over his masked face, then over his chest

and stomach.


KIM

I want you.


SPIDER-MAN

Uh


KIM

You'll leave your mask on.


SPIDER-MAN

Uh-hu, right... excuse me...


He edges away from her stroking hand and scoots into the

crowd.  She shrugs.




EXT. PLAZA - NIGHT


A public plaza in the theater district, with a large metal

Calder-esque sculpture.  A light crowd:  elegant theatre

goers, a few hookers, vendors, and street people.  Spider

Man, his web-wrapped clothes under his arm and a champagne

bottle in his hand, tries to hail a cab.  A VENDOR pops open

his sample case.


VENDOR

A watch, man.  You look like you

need a watch.  These real Rolexes,

man.  20 bucks.


A cab pulls over. The vendor hangs in there.


VENDOR

You want a red one?  Red Rolex,

right here, ten bucks.  Matches

your tux.


Spider-Man leans into the cab.


SPIDER-MAN

Can you take me to Forest Hills?


CABBIE

Twenty-five bucks over the meter. 

You pay tolls.


VENDOR

Hey, you buy three watches for

that, man!


Spider-Man gets in, the cab starts off.  The vendor goes

after a well-dressed YUPPIE COUPLE, starts his rap again.


The peculiar THROB fills the plaza.  People turn toward the

metal sculpture, which PULSATES.




INT.  CAB - NIGHT


Spider-Man faces front, the plaza behind him.  The cab moves

very slowly.


SPIDER-MAN

I'm in a hurry.  I've got to see my

aunt and uncle--


CABBIE

Fella, my foot's all the way to the

floor!




EXT.  PLAZA - NIGHT


The sculpture has become a huge magnet.  In quick succession,

every small metallic object in the area sails toward in from

all directions:


The vendor's watches fly from out of the sample case-- the

man's car keys rip through his trousers-- his shirt studs--

the woman's bra from within her evening dress-- a bag lady's

shopping cart-- a hooker's metal belt and purse-- her pimp's

"gold" chains and rings-- a fat man's buckle.


All fly to the sculpture and stick magnetically.  The THROB

and PULSE abruptly cease; the objects clatter to the plaza

pavement.


Spider-Man's cab-- suddenly released-- peels rubber with a

SCREECH.  We see his face looking out the rear window.




INT.  MIDTOWN TUNNEL - NIGHT


The cab shoots out of the tunnel into Queens.


CABBIE (VO.)

Ah, ain't any crazier than usual. 

Albino alligators in the sewers,

subway mutants wit' no faces,

spontaneous human combustion.  See

it alla time.




INT. CAB - NIGHT


Through the cab window as it turns into May's block.  Two

squad cars and a detective's sedan surround the house. 

Spider-man leans forward, concerned.




EXT. MAY'S HOUSE - NIGHT


NEIGHBORS in nightclothes cluster on the street, a uniformed

COP keeping  them back.  AD LIB CONFUSION.  "The

neighborhood's gone all to hell, I tell ya," "Such a nice

man," "What happened?" "They're animals," "No respect for

nothin'," etc.


Spider-Man, champagne in hand, collars an old lady.


SPIDER-MAN

Mrs. Shapiro, what happened?


She sees the masked face, lets out a quick SHRIEK and backs

away into the milling crowd.  MAROTTA, a homicide detective

in his 40s, waddles over.


MAROTTA

What's going on here?


SPIDER-MAN

Somebody tell me what happened!


NEIGHBOR

A burglar!


TEENAGER

They shot him.


SPIDER-MAN

Shot who?  Shot who!?


WOMAN

I was doin' the dishes--


TEENAGER

Right in the guts, blood all over.


MAROTTA

Wait.  Lieutenant Marotta, NYPD. 

What's--


SPIDER-MAN

WHO?!


NEIGHBOR

Ben, Ben Parker.  Lived in that

place for, oh, fifteen, twenty

years.


TEENAGER

Like a stuck pig, moanin', wow.


OLD MAN

Ambulance took him away and May

went--


The bottle breaks in Spider-Man's clenching fist, the rest

SMASHES to the sidewalk.


SPIDER-MAN

What hospital?


OLD MAN

Oh, I think St. Francis--


Spider-Man dashes back to the cab.


WOMAN

I was just doin' the dishes when I

heard--


MAROTTA

(yells after Spider-Man)

Hey, who the hell are you?




INT.  HOSPITAL WAITING ROOM - NIGHT


Sterile, lonely, harshly lit.  May sits stiffly on the couch,

hiding emotion.  The impersonal sounds of the paging system;

a TV drones in BG.


Peter runs in, street clothes covering the Spider-Man outfit. 

His hand bleeds from the smashed bottle.  May looks at him,

disturbingly calm.


MAY

Peter, you're bleeding.


PETER

It's fine.  Tell me what--


MAY

Oh, Ben gets through everything.


PETER

Aunt May, what happened?


MAY

I was napping on the couch.  There

was a voice and a shot.  I woke up. 

Ben was looking at me.


PETER

How is he?


MAY

He'll be fine. They won't tell me

anything, but I'm sure he'll be

fine.


He sits beside her, watching her.  He hugs her, she responds

by patting his head.


MAY

Stop that.  He'll be fine.


Peter looks stoically across the lobby.  It slowly dawns on

him:  he is watching Spider-Man on the Letterman show. 

Marotta and a uniformed cop enter the hospital waiting room,

move to Peter.


MAROTTA

You the nephew?


Peter nods, dazed.


UNIFORM COP

Your uncle's a brave old dude. 

Evidently the guy was comin' at

your aunt, so he jumped him. 

Caught a bullet, but chased the guy

away.  Lucky thing a black-'n'

white was--


MAROTTA

Not now.


From the other side of the waiting room, a grim-faced DOCTOR

crosses slowly toward them.  May stands up slowly, looks at

his face and shudders.


DOCTOR

Mrs. Parker, I'm sorry.  We tried--


A desperate sob.  May clutches her chest, gasps for air.  The

Doctor runs to her side.


DOCTOR

Jesus-- Code Blue!  Crash cart in

the lobby, Stat!


A blur of action:  orderlies, nurses, a stretcher.  Marotta

gently pulls Peter out of the line of "fire."


UNIFORM COP

We'll get the bastard who did it,

Mr. Parker.  He's trapped in a

warehouse, see, over on 112th--


Marotta silences him with a dirty look, sighs.  He puts his

arm around Peter.


MAROTTA

Kid, leave it.  You can't do

anything.


Peter pulls away, then runs out into the night.  Marotta

looks at the cop.


UNIFORM COP

Hey, I figured he oughta know!


Marotta shakes his head, walks down the hall toward the

doctor.  The Uniform Cop slumps stupidly in a chair, looks at

the TV:  the end of the Spider-Man segment.


LETTERMAN

(filter)

Are you quite finished?


SPIDER-MAN

(filter)

Just about.  See, I also have this

amazing strength.




EXT. PAINT WAREHOUSE - NIGHT


A SWAT team surrounds the dilapidated structure;

searchlights, snipers. FLASHES OF GUNFIRE from a middle story

of a tall warehouse.  A TV NEWSWOMAN broadcasts a live report

from behind the barricade.  Other reporters babble in BG.


NEWSWOMAN

-- is holding the police at bay

with a wall of automatic weapons

fire--


More SHOTS ring out in BG.


NEWSWOMAN (CONT.)

-- but because of the flammable

chemicals, the SWAT team is

helpless for now.


High above her, Spider-Man clings to a wall facing the

warehouse.  He musters his courage.


SPIDER-MAN

(to himself)

Just do it, you chicken.


He shoots a long web up to the warehouse roof, loops the

strand around his hand, and swings--


-- above the stunned police. Reporters try to catch him on

film as--


-- he arcs across the street to the warehouse, CRASHES

through a window--




INT. PAINT WAREHOUSE -NIGHT


--and SCATTERS a pyramid of stacked paint cans, splattering

paint everywhere in the dimly-lit loft.  The gunman FIRES

after the elusive shadow, strobe-like streaks of light

illuminate Spider-Man-- a vat of turpentine EXPLODES into

flame.


On the other side of the cavernous room, Spider-Man kicks

over a huge bucket of red paint, which floods across the

floor like a blood river.  The gunman, only half-visible in

the dim, smoky light, whirls and FIRES again at Spider-Man.


GUNMAN

I'll kill you-- I'll kill you!!!


Bullets spray in every direction, exploding paint cans in a

crazed rainbow of fluid and flames.


GUNMAN

WHERE ARE YOU!?


SPIDER-MAN

Up here.


The gunman looks up, aims at the ceiling-- Spider-Man hangs

from the rafters.  Just as his trigger finger clenches, a jet

of webbing shoots into the barrel of the gun, which BACKFIRES

in his hands.  Spider-man leaps down, his boot connects with

the man's jaw.  Spider-Man pulls his mask off, stands above

the unconscious gunman.


SPIDER-MAN

Get up!  I want you to look into my

eyes when I--


Spider-Man hoists the gunman off the floor in fury and

prepares to smash the man's skull. He hesitates and sees the

face of the Gunman in the dancing firelight.


SPIDER-MAN

Oh, no...

(desperate)

NO!




EXT. FIFTH AVENUE - NIGHT


FLASHBACK:  Spider-Man on the phone.  The Thief rushes toward

him and we FREEZE-FRAME on his face-- the Thief and the

Gunman are the same man.




INT.  PAINT WAREHOUSE -NIGHT


Police rush in, guns drawn.  Silence, but for the crackle of

flames and bursting of paint cans. Through the smoke, they

see something large hanging from  the rafters like a yo-yo. 

It's the Gunman, moaning, completely enveloped in webbing.




EXT. COURTHOUSE ROOF - NIGHT


Dawn starts to break over Manhattan.  CAMERA CRANES DOWN to

pick up Spider-Man on the peak of a marble facade, looking

very small indeed.



CLOSER


He tears off the mask.  Peter's eyes are red-rimmed, past

tears.  He pulls off his gloves:  one hand still bleeds from

the crushed bottle.  He pulls the check from his waistband,

stares at it then slowly rips it into small pieces.  He

stands, watching the confetti-like bits flutter downward--

then violently rips the tunic from his chest.  He pauses:  we

see the web-shooters still taped to his arms.  Peter throws

the mask, gloves and tunic down toward the street.


As the blue and red costume drifts in the wind, pas an

engraved motto:  WITH GREAT POWER COMES GREAT RESPONSIBILITY.




EXT.  CEMETERY - DAY


A chilly morning.  An urban cemetery in Queens.  In a black

suit, Peter tosses a flower into an open grave.  Several

MOURNERS, including some neighbors, bid him good-bye.  He

looks numb.


MRS. SHAPIRO

May would have liked the eulogy. 

How is she?


PETER

(absently)

Okay the doctors say no shocks for

a while.  She needs rest.


MRS. SHAPIRO

You could use some too, honey.


Peter nods, she hugs him.  A hefty, blue-collar FRIEND of

Ben's, looking awkward in a suit and tie, shakes Peter's

hand.


FRIEND

Ain't nothing you coulda done,

Peter.


No nod to this one.  Peter watches the man walk off, then

looks at the grave.




EXT.  ELECTRODYNE FACTORY - DAY


A loading bay to the vast warehouse.  The salesman checks off

a list as workers load electrical equipment into the back of

a rented truck.  A huge section of aluminum pipe sits nearby. 

Ock watches.  The salesman waves the workers away.


SALESMAN

Okay, boys, we need a forklift for

that pipe.

(To Ock)

Where do you want the bill sent?


Ock pulls a wad of crisp bills from his trench coat, hands it

to the astonished man.


SALESMAN

I'll... uh... get you a receipt...


He starts off into the warehouse, counting the cash, then

stops, hearing a heavy CLANK behind him.  He turns to see:


The enormous section of pipe sitting in the truck bed.  Ock

climbs into the cab and drives away.




INT.  STUDENT UNION - DAY


Peter, still in his suit and looking burned out, sits with

Harry over coffee.  Liz and Adele, carrying breakfast trays,

approach from the cashier in BG.


HARRY

Jesus Christ.


PETER

Mm-hmm.


HARRY

And you let me go on about Rosomoff

working me too hard?  I feel like a

complete idiot.


PETER

You're not half the idiot I am,

Harry.


Adele and Liz set their trays on the adjoining table.  Flash

enters in BG.


LIZ

Well, look who's dressing for

success.


ADELE

At least this ensemble doesn't glow

in the dark.


HARRY

Let him be.


LIZ

Why? He knows how to defend

himself.  Maybe too well.


Flash sits by Liz, waving a copy of the Bugle.  Peter's photo

of Spider-Man on page one-- with a barely perceptible rip

down the middle.  The headline reads: "TV CLOWN ESCAPES CRIME

SCENE," and subhead, "'Spider-Man' sought for questioning."


FLASH

Hey, guys.  Check it out-- I saw

this dud on the tube last night. He

is incredibly cool.


LIZ

I saw him too.  He was silly and

obnoxious.


ADELE

And Flash isn't?


LIZ

Be nice.


HARRY

Yeah, take pity on the feeble

minded.


FLASH

(the insults pass him by)

No, no, listen. They're tryin' to

say he was in cahoots with this

killer--


HARRY

Flash, drop it--


FLASH

-- but they got it all wrong.  Any

fool can figure it out.  Spider-Man

nailed this guy!


Flash guzzles Liz's glass of milk, to her annoyance.


FLASH

I mean, Spidey is one guy I'd like

to meet!


ADELE

Toads of a feather


Adele notices the photo credit.


ADELE

Peter-- you took this picture?


LIZ

Let me see.


Liz takes the paper, Flash reads it with her. Peter gets

ready to leave.


FLASH

Parker, you amaze me!  You know

this guy? Who is he, anyway?  Where

did he come from?  Is he a cop, a

martial arts freak?


PETER

He's a mistake.


Peter walks away.


FLASH

Mistake?  Hey, guy, get back here!


LIZ

Hm.  What a lump.


ADELE

What's with him?


HARRY

Nothing much.


Harry rises with his and Peter's coffee cups.


HARRY (CONT.)

His aunt had a coronary.  His uncle

was murdered by that guy Spider-Man

caught.  No, nothing much at all.


Harry exits, letting the news sink in.




INT. ROSOMOFF'S OFFICE - DAY


Roz leans on his desk by the map; Marotta tinkers with the

antique sextant.


MAROTTA

You were the last one to see

Thorkel.  In Octavius' hospital

room.


ROZ

So you've found Thorkel?


MAROTTA

Some of him char-broiled bones.

Teeth. We ruled out suicide.  Any

bad blood between him and Ock?


Roz gently takes the sextant away from him.


ROZ

Octavius wasn't the murderer type.


MAROTTA

But you said he went off a little,

after the accident, when those

mechanical arms--


ROZ

Waldos.


MAROTTA

Right. We have reason to believe he

also robbed an armored truck and

killed two men. With the waldos.


Roz reacts to this, then leans over the map.  Marotta joins

him.  Peter enters and stands politely by the door. Neither

man notices him.


ROZ

Lieutenant, I've triangulated

recent bizarre events-- the Bronx,

Jersey, Brooklyn-- all rippling out

from--

(points)

Here.  The E.S.U. Science Center. 

Octavius' experiment seems to have

opened a hole in space-time,

drastically changing the

interrelation between molecular

binding, electromagnetism and

gravity--


MAROTTA

Yeah, that's fascinating, but I'm

just a fat, dumb cop lookin' for a

psycho killer--


ROZ

There's an infinitely greater

danger. If--

(sees he won't get

through)

Listen.  The only thing Octavius

cares about is repeating his

experiment.  To do that, he needs a

radioactive catalyst, SL 270.


He hands the cop a list.  Marotta nods.


MAROTTA

Toxic dumps, huh.


ROZ

And he'll need a cyclotron.  He

can't use ours-- he's already

destroyed it.

(hands him a second list)

Guard every nuclear accelerator on

the Eastern Seaboard.  New Haven,

Long Island, two in Cambridge--


MAROTTA

You sure about all this?


ROZ

(nods)

I know him.


Marotta recognizes Peter; Roz looks at him as well. They

stare at him.


PETER

Hi.  Professor, I'm here about

another extension.  My uncle died.


Roz looks at him dubiously, then sees he's telling the truth. 

Marotta slips the lists into his coat.


ROZ

Of course.


MAROTTA

It's a lot of ground to cover.

We'll try.

(to Peter)

Funny coincidence, huh?


ROZ

No such thing as coincidence.  "God

does not play dice with the

universe."


MAROTTA

Einstein, right?  We'll see ya.


ROZ

Peter-- my condolences.


Marotta walks out. Peter nods, turns to leave.  Roz picks up

the day's Bugle.


ROZ

This photo you took of "Spider-Man"

-


PETER

Luck.  The right place at the right

time.


ROZ

Really.  I'd like to speak with

him.


PETER

I don't think I'll be running into

him.


ROZ

You never know.  Go get some sleep.


PETER

I'll try. Thanks.


Roz turns back to his map.  Peter watches him for a moment,

then exits.




INT.  PETER'S APARTMENT- DAY


On the phone, tie loosened. We hear Reiss' angry SQUEALS

through the receiver.


PETER

No No, thanks, but... No, Mr.

Reiss-- I'm finished with the

act!... Okay, I'm a fool... Look,

that's it, no more Spider-Man-- I'm

sorry. Good-bye.


He hangs up and flops face-down on the mattress, burying his

face in the pillow. The PHONE RINGS. He glares at it, but

answers.


PETER

What.




INT.  JAMESON'S OFFICE - DAY


All smiles, Jameson sits on his desk, a copy of today's Bugle

in one hand.


JAMESON (ON PHONE)

Parker, I love you.  We scooped

every paper in the country on this

Spider-Man jerk!  I want more,

Parker. I want more!


A beat.  Jameson glares.


JAMESON (ON PHONE)

What?  Aww, don't be an ass!  Get

pictures of him robbing a bank, or

kicking a dog-- anything!  This

guy's the best bad guy since

Mengele, or Son a' Sam, or J.R.

Ewing!... Eh?  Get outta here,

nobody wants a hero!




INT.  PETE'S APARTMENT


Peter looks at the SQUEAKING receiver, hangs up and unplugs

the phone.




INT. JAMESON'S OFFICE - DAY


Still on the phone. Betty, excited, enters and hands Jameson

a sales report.


JAMESON (CONT.)

Get this-- we sold out!  I'll

double the print run!  I'll slot

you on page one for the next month,

buddy!  I'll--


He finally notices the dead line.


JAMESON

Parker?

(hangs up; to Betty)

What a newsman, on the job already!




INT. PETER'S APARTMENT - DAY


Peter stands with the open costume box in his hands, looking

at the second red-and-blue outfit.  He decides something,

then stuffs it in the "LEIBER'S NOVELTIES" bag, along with

the web-shooters and the obnoxious new-wave jacket.




EXT.  EAST VILLAGE STREET - DAY


Bag in hand, Peter leaves his building and crosses the

street.


LIZ (OS)

Peter! Wait a minute!


He pauses, Liz runs up to him, a little breathless.


LIZ                        PETER

I was just coming by        I'm sorry if I was --

to apologize.


Each pauses to let the other speak, then--


LIZ                       PETER

No, I didn't know           I've been acting like

about--                     a--


Both look at each other, then giggle. The tension eases. 

They walk together.


LIZ

What's in the bag?  Garbage?


PETER

Sort of.  I'm returning the-- that

outfit that you hated so much. 

Maybe I can get my money back.


LIZ

Oh, don't do it on my account--


PETER

No, it wasn't only you-- it -- it

just wasn't my style.  Hey, look--

let's go to lunch.  Someplace nice

for a change.


LIZ

This from a man who winces at the

cost of a pretzel?


PETER

That was then.  I'm better since

the lobotomy.


He points to an imaginary scar on his forehead; they laugh

and walk off.




EXT.  ELECTRICAL SUBSTATION - DAY


A waldo thrusts INTO FRAME, penetrating a mass of circuits,

wires and switches.  Sparks and ozone fill the air. 

All four of Ock's arms work at once, cutting and resplicing

high-tension wires in the caged transformer.  Ock's eyes

frenetically scan a series of voltmeters; one registers

escalating levels while others jump, then drop.


A LINEMAN sees Ock from the rear, the waldos stretching from

his torso.


LINEMAN

Hey!


Ock ignores him.  The Lineman pulls a heavy wrench from his

toolbelt and brandishes it, approaching warily.  Without

turning around, Ock extends a waldo backward, grabs the

wrench and crushes it in two. The Lineman runs off.


Near the fence, the panicked Lineman slams into two GUARDS,

male and female.


LINEMAN

My wrench!  He-- it-- arms!


The guards draw their guns as he clambers over the fence.


Another voltmeter needle swings as Ock throws a switch.


FEMALE GUARD

Freeze!  Hands up!


Ock turns, the waldos waving like Medusa's hair.  The guard

steps forward, her bullet RICOCHETS off a telescoping metal

arm.  It grabs the gun and the woman's hand, squeezing.  A

second waldo whips around the male guard's neck, shakes him

like a terrier with a rat, then hurls him into a wall of

wires.


Electricity jolts his body and knocks him out.  Ock's

attention returns to his work.  Released, the woman falls to

her knees in pain, crawls to her fallen comrade.  Her hand

extends for his revolver.  But her body is dragged away from

the gun-- a waldo had her ankle.  She SCREAMS.  Another waldo

slaps her head, knocks her out.


A voltmeter reads zero.  Ock frowns-- then spies a locked

metal cabinet marked "Third Rail Circuit-- NY Transit

Authority."  Ock considers this.




INT. CHIC FRENCH RESTAURANT- DAY


An imperious WAITER sets dessert before Peter and Liz, out of

place in the refined environment.


PETER

-- but at least Aunt May's okay

now. I really have to stop by the

hospital this afternoon.


LIZ

Do you mind if I come too?


PETER

I think I'd like that.


He ignores his dessert, stares out the window.


PETER

They keep saying there's nothing I

could've done.  That's a lie.  I

could've done something.  If only

I'd paid attention to my feelings.


LIZ

You're not trained for that.  None

of us are... I mean, sometimes I...

(practical)

Okay, let's say you had gone back. 

What then?  Are you bulletproof?


PETER

Well, no.


LIZ

So?  The next day I'd read, "Peter

Parker murdered," and I'd feel...


PETER

You'd feel what?


LIZ

(covering)

Listen.  You think you're

responsible for everything that

happens.  Don't flagellate yourself

- and don't flatter yourself,

either.  You're not the center of

the universe. You're just... Peter.


PETER

Am I?  I'm not so sure.

(looks at her)

I used to be sure of a lot of

things.  Oh, different things from

week to week, but now-- I'm not

sure of anything anymore.


LIZ

I know what you mean.  I...


He looks a little queasy-- the spider-sense again.  Liz's

voice and the restaurant SOUND drop out, TRACK IN TO TIGHT

CLOSE-UP on Peter.  We hear the Ock THROB and PANICKED CRIES

of people in a subway car.


Abruptly, we're back to reality.  And Liz is being oddly

inarticulate,


LIZ

Maybe unsure is-- good.  Maybe you

feel more that way.  Like I was

sure you and I were just friends--

and that's it.  But-- last weekend,

when I was with Flash-- all I could

think of was--


She sees Peter is paying absolutely no attention.  She bangs

her spoon against her glass.


LIZ

Hello.  Earth to Peter.  Are you

listening?


PETER

Unh-huh.  Excuse me.  I've gotta

go.


He grabs the Lieber's bag and hurried out.  The waiter sets

the check down before the boiling Liz.


LIZ

I think I really do hate him.




EXT.  OFFICE DISTRICT - DAY


Such as Wall Street.  "Walk" and "Don't Walk" signs blink

simultaneously, stoplights flash with no pattern then EXPLODE

in series down the street.  Pedestrian and vehicle traffic

snarls, HONKING HORNS, frazzled nerves.


The THROB begins-- low, muffled, under the street cacophony. 

At an intersection, two cars coming from opposite directions

suddenly swerve toward each other. The drivers spin their

steering wheels to avoid a crash, but magnetic attraction

makes them slide through the intersection, smash together

sideways and stick.  The drivers, inches apart, look at each

other, baffled.


A taxi swerves around the wreck--




EXT.  WARPED STREET - DAY


--and down this less-crowded street.  The THROB swells.




THROUGH THE WINDSHIELD


The PULSE spreads through the asphalt ahead, rippling mirage

like.


The taxi's wheels sink into the liquefying street, now the

consistency of quicksand.  The driver crawls out his window

and leaps to the sidewalk as the gooey street swallows the

cab.


Spider-Man swings to the edge of an overlooking building,

watches the cab sink.  An earthquake-like RUMBLE from below.


From beneath the street, a subway train BURSTS UP, arcs into

the air with a ROAR--


-- the three-car train sails through the air past Spider-Man--


-- a huge hole opens like an iris in the facade of a nearby

modern office building


-- the train thrusts into the shimmering hole, which clamps

shut around it.


The THROB and PULSE cease. The street below re-solidifies,

trapping half-buried cars.  SCREAMS, HONKS, SIRENS.




INT.  OFFICE BUILDING - DAY


Businessmen and secretaries peek from under desks and around

doorways.  One-and-a-half subway cars sit incongruously in

their office.  The passengers clamber out windows, pry doors

open.




INT.  MIDDLE CAR - DAY


Solid structural glass bisects the middle car.  Commuters in

the outside half of the car press their faces against the

glass, pound for help.




EXT. OFFICE BUILDING - DAY


The other one-and-a-half cars of the subway protrude from the

sheer face of the building, the last car dangling vertically

by its hitch, ten floors above the street.




INT.  LAST CAR - DAY


Vertical.  A pile of a half-dozen COMMUTERS on the "bottom

end."  AD LIB panicked cries: "Give me a hand--" "What--!" 

"I was going to take the bus!" "Not the door!"  A wild-eyed

teenager pulls open the rear door, a bag of fruit spills down--




EXT. WARPED STREET - DAY


and SPLATTERS on the pavement. A crowd gathers, points up. 

More AD LIB cries:  "This city's nuts!"  "Get the fire

department!"  "Oh, my God!"




EXT.  OFFICE BUILDING - DAY


Spider-Man shoots a long stream of webbing and swings to the

glass-front building.




INT.  MIDDLE CAR - DAY


Spider-Man's head pops in an open window.


SPIDER-MAN

Hello.


The passengers stare as he climbs in, backs them away from

the glass wall.


SPIDER-MAN

Okay, folks, stand back!


He kicks it--nothing.  Frustrated, he grabs a metal railing. 

Two passengers help him uproot it.  Spider-Man uses the pole

as a battering ram, punching a hole in the window.  Office

workers aid the passengers. Spider-Man runs toward the last

car.




INT.  LAST CAR - DAY


The 2nd and 3rd car are at right-angles to each other. Spidey

opens the door at the "top" of the car, scampers down the

grab-handles to the people below.  The half-dozen passengers

cling to seats.


SPIDER-MAN

Cavalry's here-- get the wagons in

a circle.


He hefts a ROTUND WOMAN over his shoulder.


SPIDER-MAN

Have you tried Weight Watchers?


She whacks him with her purse as he scampers straight up the

floor.




EXT.  LAST CAR


The door between cars.  Spider-Man pushes the woman up--

helping hands from the middle car lift her to safety.




EXT. WARPED STREET - DAY


The crowd parts as a hook and ladder truck rumbles up over

the sidewalk.




EXT. LAST CAR - DAY


Spider-Man pushes another passenger to safety.  The thick

iron link between the cars CREAKS, bending under the strain.




EXT. WARPED STREET


The fire ladder rests against the building, below and to one

side of the swaying car.




INT. LAST CAR


The subway car lurches perilously.  Spidey returns to the two

remaining people.


SPIDER-MAN

Let's take  the scenic route.




EXT.  LAST CAR


Spider-Man lowers a web-wrapped girl down through the door,

swings her like a pendulum.  After a close miss, a FIREMAN

atop the ladder grabs the girl.


The iron link bends nearly open.


Spider-Man fastens a thread of webbing to the outside of the

car.


SPIDER-MAN

First floor, ladies lingerie,

sporting goods...


He grabs the terrified man around the waist, then lets out

the line of webbing in short bursts to lower himself and the

man to the sidewalk.




EXT.  WARPED STREET


Firemen rush to help, a white Mercedes limo pulls up.  The

chauffeur opens the door for the POLITICO, who beams for the

news cameras.


POLITICO

Where's the hero?  I want to thank

him personally for his fine--


An ominous GRATING of iron from above.


SPIDER-MAN

Get back! It's coming down!


He scatters the crowd.  The Politico looks up at the subway. 

The chauffeur runs.


POLITICO

Oh, no-- my limo-- my Mercedes!


He scrambles to his car.  Spidey intercepts him, hefts him

like a sack of potatoes and runs to cover as--


-- the subway car rips away from its link--


-- and falls, flattening the limo. Pieces scatter in every

direction.


Cameras click as Spider-Man sets the whimpering Politico

down.


POLITICO

My Mercedes...


SPIDER-MAN

This is all you need.


He hands him the Mercedes hood ornament.


REPORTER

Hey, you some kind of superhero?


SPIDER-MAN

Actually, I'm just trying to do as

little harm as possible.


BUSINESSMAN

Can I get your autograph?  Er-- for

my kid, he's a fan.


SPIDER-MAN

Fans? I have fans?


He starts to sign "Pete--, " crosses it out, signs "Spidey"

with a flourish.


BYSTANDER

He was here before it happened!  I

bet he caused the whole thing!


SPIDER-MAN

What!?


POLITICO

He assaulted me!  I want him

arrested!


FIREMAN

Councilman, this guy just saved a

whole buncha lives--


COP

Okay, Zorro, assume the position.


The cop pushes Spider-Man spread-eagle against a car.


FIREMAN

Give the guy a break!


POLITICO

Take off his mask!  He destroyed my

car!  That's city property!


The cop, fireman and politico argue, ignoring Spider-Man, who

shakes his head and scampers up the wall.  The crowd

APPLAUDS; he waves and disappears over a roof.




INT. JAMESON'S OFFICE - DAY


Jameson leans back in his chair by an open window, reading a

competitor's paper. Like Kilroy, Spider-Man peaks over the

sill, then leans in to tap Jameson's shoulder.


JAMESON

Ak!


He spins up out of his chair and backs away, horrified.


JAMESON

Don't hurt me, you Thing you!  I've

got scummy lawyers like you

wouldn't believe--


Spider-Man crawls the rest of the way in and sits on a wall,

chin in hand.


SPIDER-MAN

Relax, Jameson.  This is business. 

I know you want photos of me, so

I'll give your boy Parker an

exclusive.  On one condition--


JAMESON

I don't submit to blackmail!  The

first amendment protects my freedom

to tell the news as I imagine it,

and--


SPIDER-MAN

Would you cool it already?


JAMESON

Police, help!  Po-- mmph.


Web goo shoots out and covers Jameson's mouth.  Jameson

inches to the door.


SPIDER-MAN

Thank you.  Now, repeat after me--

Spider-Man is a good guy. On the

side of right, and niceness, and

cute baby animals and all that.


JAMESON

Frmpph-yrr.


SPIDER-MAN

Fine.


Spider-Man webs the door locked as Jameson grabs the knob. 

Betty and others gather at the glass partition, amused.


SPIDER-MAN

Your friendly, neighborhood Spider

Man could use the good p.r. at the

moment.


He heads for the window.  Jameson points frantically at his

glued-up mouth.


SPIDER-MAN

Oh, that?  It'll come unstuck in a

half-hour or so. Your mouth needs

the rest.  Bye.


JAMESON

Hmf-hrr?


Spider-Man waves at the laughing Bugle employees and drops

out.




INT.  MAY'S HOSPITAL ROOM - DAY


A four-person ward.  May's corner already reflects her

personality: bright flowers, the photo-cub of Peter, a

patchwork comforter.  She sits up in bed, alert but tired. 

Liz sits beside her on the bed.  An OLD CRONE in the next

bed, watching a muted TV news across the room-- featuring

Spidey footage.


LIZ

He left.  I couldn't believe it--

he just left!  It's as if he's

somewhere else... I'm only getting

a piece of him.


MAY

When Peter was little, he loved to

hide.  In closets, under the sink. 

He needed a secret place.  But when

I'd look for him, he'd laugh... he

wanted to be found.


LIZ

I don't think he wants me to find

him.


AGED CRONE

Sure he does, toots.  May, gimme

dat changer thingie.


May flings the remote control across to the Crone's bed.


MAY

Television is for idiots.  Read a

book.


AGED CRONE

Read this.


The Crone gives May a "fongoo" bent elbow.  Liz draws the

curtain between the beds.


MAY

I wish Ben said that to me, just

once.  I never let up, always

needling him, telling him what to

do.


Liz takes May's hand.


MAY

Maybe I was hiding.  For years, I

never told Ben the one important

thing.


LIZ

He knew.


MAY

Some things you should say anyway.


LIZ

Even if they're not clever.


MAY

Even if you've heard them a million

times in every stupid pop song ever

written.


LIZ

What if you get hurt?


MAY

What if the world ends tomorrow?


They look at each other.  We hear the TV--


NEWSCASTER (FILTER)

-- still baffled as to the cause of

the subway disaster.  The alleged

"Spider-Man" is still wanted for

questioning.  In other news, police

have a suspect in yesterday's

armored truck robbery and double

murder--




EXT.  NEW YORK STREETS - DAY




WITH SPIDER-MAN


Swinging from skyscraper to skyscraper-- reeling, like a

roller-coaster through the concrete canyons.


From street level, looking up as Spider-Man swings like

Tarzan. Pedestrians react:  "Wowie," "Check that out,"

"What's he advertising!" "It's that jerk Spider-Man," etc.




EXT. CROWDED STREET - DAY


Ock, trench-coated as usual, drives his rented truck. It

sputters to a halt in the middle of traffic.  HORNS,

impatient YELLS.




INT. RENTAL TRUCK - DAY


The gas gauge reads Empty.  Ock climbs out, leaving the truck

blocking the street.




EXT. CROWDED STREET- DAY


SPIDER-MAN'S POV:  DIFFUSE, except for Ock in FOCUS as he

walks through traffic, oblivious to the uproar he's caused.




STREET LEVEL


A waldo tears off the driver's door of a commuter's Cadillac. 

Ock slides in.


OCK

Out.


COMMUTER

Sure thing.


He scrambles out the passenger door.


Spider-Man swoops down and across the street, still above

Ock.




EXT.  NEW YORK STREETS - DAY


The Caddy shoots around traffic, through red lights-- while

Spidey swings right behind it, losing ground.


To avoid congestion, Ock drives on the sidewalk, scattering

panicked pedestrians.


Spider-Man clings to a wall, shaking his head.  He leaps down

and --


-- lands on the roof of a fast taxi paralleling Ock.  The

cabbie ignores the CLUNK.


Ock rounds a corner, Spider-Man leaps from the taxi to the

rear seat of a motorcycle ridden by a BIKER CHICK in leathers

and helmet.


SPIDER-MAN

Could you do me a favor and, er--


BIKER CHICK

-- follow that car?  Love to, but

you gotta wear a helmet. It's the

law.


He takes the spare helmet from the sissy bar and fastens it

on.


They trail Ock's car through downtown, drawing stares.




EXT.  GEORGE WASHINGTON BRIDGE - DAY


Ock's Caddy speeds up an on-ramp.  The Biker Chick, close

behind, pulls over.


BIKER

I don't do Jersey.  Bad vibes.


SPIDER-MAN

I'm hip.  Thanks for the lift.


He hands her the helmet and she screeches off. Spider-Man

spies an approaching semi, runs-- and leaps, clinging to the

side of the trailer.


The semi moves over the bridge.  Ock's Caddy is several cars

ahead, halfway over the bridge.  Spider-Man crawls up to the

top of the trailer.  A cloudy sky, an impending storm.




EXT. JERSEY TURNPIKE - DAY


Standing atop the trailer with hands on hips, Spider-Man sees

Ock veer onto an exit.  As the truck passes the exit, Spidey

swings on an overhead exit sign toward the overpass.


Spider-Man lands on the overpass. Ock's car recedes out of

sight. There are no buildings to swing from, no vehicles to

cling to.  It starts to rain.  Spider-Man sighs and starts

walking.




EXT.  MUDDY STREET - NIGHT


Sunset. Drizzle.  A sleazy area of wrecking yards and dumps. 

A police car with two gaping holes in the windshield -- and

two patrolmen dead inside.  CAMERA RISES over a concrete wall

with rusting signs: "Toxic Waste Dump #49," and "Hazard--

Radioactive and Poisonous Materials," with a radioactivity

symbol and skull and crossbones.  Over the barbed wire atop

the wall, we see within.




EXT. TOXIC WASTE DUMP - NIGHT


A nightmarish industrial landscape:  giant vats over-brimming

with rancid chemicals; stacked, rusting drums; puddles of

viscous fluid on the gravel bedding.


In an open concrete bunker, Ock uses his human hands to pull

open a vault-like drawer. Inside are dozens of sealed

canisters, all bearing "Danger-- Radioactivity" warnings.  He

checks through them, discarding unwanted canisters

haphazardly.  One near the back catches his eye:  "SL 270" is

scrawled on the stained label. He plucks it out, examines it,

nodding.


SPIDER-MAN (O.S.)

Open that now and you'll spoil

Christmas.


Ock whirls around. Spider-Man drops down from atop a chemical

vat, clucking his tongue and sauntering toward him.


SPIDER-MAN

Surprise!


OCK

Surprise...


He pulls open his overcoat-- all four waldos telescope toward

the astonished Spider-Man.  They encircle his body, squeezing

like pythons. Spider-Man gulps for air, struggling

desperately against the steel arms.  He wriggles a hand free,

shoots webbing up and pulls himself from Ock's clutches.


Ock grabs the small canister-- but a stream of webbing shoots

down and jerks the container up to Spider-Man on the roof of

the bunker. He springs down to the ground on the run.


Ock's waldos lift an oil drum and hurl it over his head. The

drum BURSTS ahead of Spidey, spraying a greasy cloud of

noxious gas and sizzling liquid.  Spider-Man gags as Ock

rumbles toward him.


OCK

You are an insect!


SPIDER-MAN

Doc, you know better than that. 

Insects are a completely different

order from spiders--


Spider-Man ducks as a waldo shoots out, puncturing a hole in

a metal vat, which EXPLODES.  He rolls under a flaming stream

of napalm-like fluid.


A waldo grabs the SL 270 container; a third arm backhands

Spider-Man, knocking him through the air into a concrete

wall.  Shaken, Spider-Man gets to his feet, stumbles after

Ock.


SPIDER-MAN

Well?  Had enough?


Ock uses the waldos to pull himself over the retaining wall. 

Spider-Man leaps onto Ock's back, throws him in a head-lock. 

Ock sputters, strikes backward with his real fists, to no

avail.


SPIDER-MAN

Aren't we both too intellectual for

this?


A deep, ugly roar echoes from Ock's chest. Two waldos whip

backward, grab Spider-Man and fling him violently over the

top of the wall--




EXT.  MUDDY STREET - NIGHT


and onto the roof of the patrol car.  He bounces off and

splashes into a puddle. Painfully, he rolls over, struggling

to his hands and knees.  Out of nowhere, a waldo claw

clutches at his throat, squeezing.  Spider-Man presses the

web-shooter triggers-- they spurt blobs of goop, then air,

out of webbing.


Ock thrusts Spider-Man against the wall, rears back with

another arm and aims a deadly blow. Spider-Man jerks his head

- the metal fist misses by inches, punching a crater in the

concrete.  Ock laughs maniacally, prepares for the final

blow.


ROZ (O.S.)

Octavius!


Ock turns and sees Roz, getting out of his vintage Porsche.


ROZ

Please.


The wild violence drains from Ock's face, replaced for a

moment by sanity. He looks at Rosomoff, then at the metal

arms, then again at Roz, pitifully.  With an anguished cry,

he loosens the grip on the choking Spider-Man.  Ock rushes to

the Cadillac, drives off.  SIRENS wail in the distance as Roz

helps Spider-Man to his feet.


ROZ

I sent for  the police.  We can

explain.


SPIDER-MAN

Explain that some jerk in a mask

and costume fought a mad scientist

with four tentacles?


ROZ

Right.  Let's go.




INT.  ROZ'S CAR - NIGHT


Spider-Man opens his window for air as Roz drives the bridge

to Manhattan.


ROZ

You're sure you're all right.


SPIDER-MAN

(coughs)

Yeah, just a lung full of New

Jersey.  Lucky you showed up when

you did.


ROZ

Logic.  Lot 49 is the closest

stockpile of SL 270--

(looks at him)

I do feel foolish talking with a

man dressed like a--


SPIDER-MAN

Imagine how I feel.


ROZ

Excuse me if I'm impertinent, but--

how did you become whatever it is

you are?


SPIDER-MAN

The usual.  Heredity and

environment.  What's the deal with

Doc Ock?


ROZ

He'll try to finish his experiment.


SPIDER-MAN

And blow up the universe just to

prove he's right?  Bit egotistical,

isn't it?


ROZ

A messianic complex is nothing new

to Octavius. In  his universe,

there's only one mind-- his own. 

It must be very lonely.


SPIDER-MAN

Forgive me if I don't feel too

sympathetic right now.


They drive south to Lower Manhattan on West End Avenue in the

rain.


ROZ

I listened to him talk of eternal

truth and thought of the Bhagavad

Gita, the Indian holy book-- "I am

become Shiva, Death-- the destroyer

of worlds."  Octavius was...


SPIDER-MAN

Bonkers.


ROZ

Loonytunes.  And yet...


SPIDER-MAN

Just drop me off here.




EXT.  WATERFRONT DISTRICT - NIGHT


The car pulls over near the eerie wharves under the elevated

West Side Drive.  Spider-Man gets out and leans in the

window. The rain has stopped.


ROZ

Do you... live around here?


SPIDER-MAN

No, but I've got this secret

identity to worry about. I'll swing

the rest of the way.


ROZ

I see.  Well, Octavius won't get

much further. They'll catch him

and... put him away.  Sad.  He

might very well have the truth.


SPIDER-MAN

Phooey on that.


Roz drives off.  Spider-Man raises his arms to shoot a web--

it makes PHFFT noise, still out of webbing.  He groans

disgustedly, heads down a rain-slicked street.




EXT.  NEW YORK STREETS - NIGHT


Spider-Man trudges cross town toward home. Quick images of

nighttime New York:  warehouses; tenements; Chinatown; the

Bowery. Spidey walks by a group of gang kids, who laugh and

point.


He stops a robbery by tiredly flipping the mugger into a

dumpster. He avoids a police car by leaping and clinging to

the side of a building.  Inside a window he sees a couple

kissing passionately.  He looks away and drops to the street.




EXT. PETER'S APARTMENT BUILDING - NIGHT


Spider-Man stands on the landing, slaps his thighs for his

keys-- nothing.


SPIDER-MAN

(mutters)

I gotta get pockets.


He hops on the wall and climbs upward.  Near the roof, he

hears the RUMBLE of an MG engine and VOICES below.  Harry,

Liz, Adele and Flash tumble out of the tiny car and head to

the front door.


FLASH

Aww-- we forgot the beer!


ADELE

I'm not sure this is a great idea.


HARRY

(ala Garbo)

Maybe he vants to be alone.


LIZ

Come on.  He needs friends now.


Groaning, Spider-Man crawls onto the roof, opens the

skylight.




INT.  PETER'S HALLWAY - NIGHT


Flash brings up the rear on the stairs. Everyone's puffing

from the climb.


FLASH

Is this worth it?  He's so damned

dull.  And I bet he doesn't have

any beery treats.


Peter answers Liz's knock.  In his bathrobe, his face

bruised, he looks a mess.


LIZ

Peter!  You poor baby, what

happened?




INT. PETER'S APARTMENT - NIGHT


Flash claps Peter on the back, pushes past to the kitchen. 

Peter winces when Liz touches his bruise.  She shakes her

head and goes to the bathroom medicine chest.


ADELE

What did happen to you?


PETER

It's nothing.  Look--


HARRY

You get mugged or something?


PETER

Listen, I do appreciate your

concern, but--


HARRY

I got you a present.


He pulls a colorful can from his jacket pocket-- Peter

unscrews the lid and spring-snakes fly out.  Peter looks at

Harry tiredly.


HARRY

(lamely)

Thought it might cheer you up.


Flash closes the fridge and returns from the kitchen.


FLASH

Let's go somewhere and get ya

blotto.


ADELE

I'm sorry about your uncle


FLASH

Guess Uncle Ben got his rice

converted--


Flash yoks it up. Liz enters from the bathroom with cotton

swabs and a bottle of rubbing alcohol.


LIZ

Flash, get lost.


FLASH

Come on, laughter's the best

medicine!


Adele pushes him out the door.  Liz looks at Harry, who nods

and follows the others into the hallway.  Liz eases Peter

down onto the mattress.  Flash tries to look back inside--

Adele closes the door.


Liz dabs Peter's bruises.  His head's on the pillow, her face

is close to his.  He's totally exhausted.


PETER

I'm sorry about being a jerk this

afternoon.


LIZ

Just shut up and close your eyes. 

This'll hurt.


Eyes shut, he hardly has the energy to wince as she dabs a

cut on his temple.


LIZ

May's much better. She'll be out

soon.


PETER

Oh, God, I forgot to--


LIZ

Ssh.

(dabs him again)

I always thought she was a strong

person.  She is-- but not for the

reasons I thought.


PETER

(half-asleep)

Strong...


LIZ

Her cleverness, that hard edge--

maybe they're the weakest part of

her. The strong part is what's

underneath.  The part she was

protecting.  There's no reason to

protect it... I think she's just

finding that out now.


Peter's features relax.  Liz puts down the bottle of alcohol.


LIZ

Peter?


PETER

(far away)

I'm here...


He's out.  Liz sees this and smiles.


LIZ

So am I.


She kisses him tenderly on the lips, then curls beside him on

the bed.




EXT. HIGH-TECH CYCLOTRON - NIGHT


Barbed-wire barricades, searchlights and National Guard

troops surround a sprawling, futuristic accelerator lab.  An

OFFICER leans out of a patrol car marked 'SUFFOLK COUNTY

POLICE."


OFFICER

Is there an NYPD Lieutenant here? 

It's a Professor Rizzo, or Rosta,

or--


With an all-night beard, Marotta comes to the car, a

Styrofoam cup of coffee in hand, grabs the mike.


MAROTTA

Yeah, Roz.


ROZ (FILTER)

Any sign of our friend?


MAROTTA

Nope.  Maybe he skipped to Rio. 

Feds got troops surrounding every

cyclotron on the continent.  Are

you absolutely positive that one at

E.S.U. is kaput?




INT.  ROSOMOFF'S OFFICE - NIGHT


Roz, fully dressed, sits on the desk.


ROZ

You didn't see it, Lieutenant. 

You'd need a half a dozen men,

precise equipment.  They'd have to

rebuild the transformer from

scratch.  There were...


His voice trails off-- he realizes Ock's plan.  Marotta's

voice frantically squeaks through the phone.


MAROTTA (FILTER)

Roz? Rosomoff?  What is it?


ROZ

Precise equipment such as waldos


The lights flicker and the phone RINGS madly, then EXPLODES.




EXT.  HIGH TECH CYCLOTRON - NIGHT


A high-pitched WHINE on the radio.


MAROTTA

Roz? What's goin' on?




EXT.  NEW YORK SKYLINE - NIGHT


Lighted buildings flash dark in clusters.




INT.  PETER'S APARTMENT - NIGHT


Peter sleeps, Liz, fully dressed, asleep beside him.  TRACK

IN ON PETER; we hear the Ock THROB growing LOUDER and FASTER,

CACOPHONY of SCREAMS, EXPLOSIONS, the end of the world. 

SOUNDS STOP, Peter sits bolt upright in bed.  He extricates

himself, goes to the window.  The lights in his apartment go

OUT, as do those throughout the neighborhood.


PETER

Doctor Octopus, I presume.


In the dim light, we see QUICK CUTS of Peter strapping on his

web-shooters, loading fresh cartridges, pulling on his

gloves, pulling down the Spider-Man mask.  Liz half-opens her

eyes sleepily.


LIZ

Peter...?


Spider-Man leaps up to the skylight and slips out.




EXT.  NEW YORK STREETS - NIGHT


Spider Man's form swings against the night sky through the

blacked-out city.


A baseball bat SMASHES a jewelry store window. Three LOOTERS

fill their arms with sparkling rings and necklaces.


The leader turns, and catches a red boot in the chin that

knocks him end over end.  Spider-Man's fists quickly dispatch

the other two.


Across the street, three more LOOTERS run out of a pawn shop,

carrying an assortment of radios, instruments, cameras, etc.


SPIDER-MAN

There's no time!


He takes a running jump, bounces on a car roof like a

trampoline, and tackles two of the looters.  On the ground,

he shoots a jet of webbing at the third looter's back, then

pulls hard and yanks him down.


People of all colors and social strata scramble down fire

escapes and into the streets to chase off the looters. 

Spider-Man clambers up a wall and swings off.




INT.  EXPERIMENTAL CHAMBER - NIGHT


Makeshift repairs-- patches of fresh metal plating, jerry

rigged wiring, even repairs made with gaffer's tape.  All is

still strangely warped.  The experiment's already going: 

BRILLIANT LIGHT from the focusing cone again concentrates on

the gram weight, which shivers.  Ock stands in the middle of

it all, waldos working feverishly at an improvised control

board.  He's lost in his mad rapture.




INT.  CONTROL ROOM - NIGHT


Still showing the effects of the original implosion:  the

glass wall melted, dials and controls warped and useless. 

Roz leans against the twisted glass, shielding his eyes from

the glare within the chamber.


ROZ

(hoarsely)

My God, Otto, you have to hear me! 

The world we know will collapse! 

Everything we have devoted our

lives to-- all patterns, all

harmonies-- will be destroyed!


OCK

Truth.  Truth alone exists. Truth

must be released...


ROZ

You have no right!  This is cosmic

suicide!


In desperation, Roz climbs through the melted glass into the

chamber, grabbing a waldo and trying to pull it from a huge

rheostat.  Ock, watching the gram weight, pays no attention

to Roz's futile struggle.  The arm, moving to another part of

the room, swats Roz aside and knocks him to the floor.




ON THE GRAM WEIGHT


The tiny cylinder rises very slowly from the scale, the THROB

rises in pitch.  Suddenly, the weight "falls upward,"

accelerating toward the ceiling as if dropped.


Spider-Man's hand catches the gram weight.  He's clinging to

the ceiling.


SPIDER-MAN

Hey, Doc-- you dropped something.


Spider-Man leaps onto Octavius and kicks him in the chest,

knocking him backward, into a pile of acetylene tanks and

torches.  Roz gets to his feet.


ROZ

Spider-Man, be careful!  He's quite

mad.


SPIDER-MAN

I'm not so happy myself.


Without warning, a waldo springs out and wallops Spider-Man

in the head.  The blow sends him flying, knocks him up

against the focusing cone.   He falls on the floor in a heap--

unconscious.


The BLUE-WHITE BEAM focuses on the floor.  Roz runs for the

cone and tries to right it, but a waldo grabs him by the

collar and flings him away.


Ock smiles and cranks up the power.  The PULSE ripples

through the tiles, sends them falling to the ceiling.  The

cement floor beneath begins to glow.




EXT.  NEW YORK STREETS - NIGHT


SIRENS in the distance; running; shadowy figures. The beam of

a flashlight in Liz's hand cuts through the darkness:  she,

Harry and Adele hurry through the streets.


HARRY

(sleepily)

This is a great way to get killed.


ADELE

New York is a big place, Liz.


LIZ

He was hurt-- he might be delirious

or something.  We have to find--

(beat)

Listen!


She hears the faint THROB, runs up the street to locate it.




EXT.  SCIENCE CENTER -  NIGHT


Light spills from the torn-open front door, the only

illumination in the area.  The PULSE spreads through the

sidewalk, the cement paving ripples and THROBS.  Liz runs

toward the building-- Adele grabs her.


ADELE

Uh, Liz, I don't think--


Liz breaks away from Adele and dashes up the steps.  Adele

hurries after her-- a crevice opens as the building's steps

crumble.  Harry pulls Adele away.




INT.  SCIENCE CENTER MAIN FLOOR - NIGHT


The building CREAKS, hunks of ceiling fall downward.  Liz

runs upstairs to a corridor with many doors.


LIZ

Peter!  Peter, where are you?!


A crack opens in the corridor's floor beneath Liz.  She leaps

out of the way, twists open the knob of a door marked

"Biology Lab," gets in just as a hole opens in the floor

where she'd been standing.




EXT.  SCIENCE CENTER - NIGHT


Adele and Harry back away as the structure shakes and

RUMBLES, the brick walls slowly sliding upward, the concrete

foundation rising into view.  The sidewalk buckles, trees

uproot and fall over.




INT. EXPERIMENTAL CHAMBER - NIGHT


The room vibrates.  Roz drags the unconscious Spider-Man

toward the control room.  The PULSE envelops the entire

floor, the light casts eerie shadows upward on Ock's face.




EXT.  SCIENCE CENTER - NIGHT


The building pulls free from the ground.  Adele, Harry and

others in the area take cover as water mains burst, spewing

fountains.




INT. BIOLOGY LAB - NIGHT


Liz steadies herself as chairs and tables slide from one end

of the room to the other. A cageful of white mice tumbles to

the floor and snaps open, the mice scurry in panic.




EXT.  SCIENCE CENTER - NIGHT


Heavy electrical cables stretch upward to the rising

building, then snap in showers of sparks.  The Science Center

rises further, now airborne-- the electrical cables point

upward, shooting arcs of power directly at the building.




ANGLE UP


as the Science Center hovers above the surrounding buildings

like a brick spaceship.




INT. BIOLOGY LAB - NIGHT


Liz clutches a window sill, looking out-- and down.




HER POV-- RISING


The E.S.U. neighborhood recedes, hundreds of feet below. 

Dawn begins to show in the distance, silhouetting Manhattan.




EXT. SUBSTATIONS - DAWN


In rapid succession, power stations around the city EXPLODE

and shoot rivers of electricity toward the building ascending

in the distance.




EXT.  NEW YORK SKYLINE - DAWN


Twisting, rope-like beams crack through the sky, ripping

holes through skyscrapers in their path.


The bolts of power shoot at the concrete foundation--




INT. EXPERIMENTAL CHAMBER - DAWN


--and rip gaping holes through the walls and floor, directly

to the whining cyclotron transformer, which pulses and

THROBS.  Curling arcs of power dance crazily around Ock. He

watches in ecstasy, his waldos twitch and curl in pleasure.




INT. CONTROL ROOM - DAWN


The twisted banks of electronics BURST. Roz shakes Spider

Man.


ROZ

Get up!  The second phase!




EXT.  NEW YORK- DAY


An energy cyclone erupts and whirls beneath the rising

structure, sucking objects from the street:  tine cans-- bus

benches-- trees-- newsstands-- parked cars.  All swirl in the

inverted funnel growing beneath the building.




INT. EXPERIMENTAL CHAMBER - DAY


Spider-Man leaps around the energy streams to catch Ock's

attention.  Intensely absorbed in the experiment's progress,

he reacts slowly.  His waldos probe toward Spider-Man, who

dances and whirls away from their grasp.


Roz makes his way toward Ock's control board.


Spider-Man hurls an acetylene tank at Ock, who deflects it--

an energy bolt hits it and the tank EXPLODES, tearing a door

sized hole in the floor behind Spider-Man.  Roz, at the

controls, nods to Spider-Man.


SPIDER-MAN

Come and get me, squid-breath


OCK

You annoy me!


Ock lunges for him, but Spider-Man jumps down through the

hole in the floor.  Ock falls after him.




EXT.  SCIENCE CENTER - DAY


Looking up from the bottom of the building: arcs of energy

crackle through the cloud cover and shoot into the basement. 

Falling, Ock thrusts a steel tentacle through the concrete as

an anchor, and vaults arm over arm after Spider-Man.


Spider-Man scrambles around the edge of the foundation--


--and onto the front facade.  A waldo clamps around his ankle

and tugs violently.  Spider-Man resists, pulls against it,

but a second waldo clutches his arm and peels him completely

off the wall.


The two waldos shake and whip him around like a rag doll.




SPIDER-MAN'S POV:


The sun and the horizon swirl crazily, Manhattan far below

through a gap in the clouds.


Ock smiles.  The waldos release Spider-Man-- he falls-- but

immediately shoots a jet of webbing onto a metal tentacle. 

The sudden weight causes Ock to waver precariously.  Spider

Man shoots another web and swings up to the front facade.




INT.  EXPERIMENTAL CHAMBER - DAY


Roz, in a sweat, throws the rheostat-- an ear-splitting

SCREECH--




EXT.  SCIENCE CENTER - DAY


Several of the energy streams dissipate.  The building halts

its ascent, then lurches.  Is facade tilts toward the

horizontal.  Ock's arms thrust into brick to hold on.  Spider

Man clings flat against a glass doorway.  The horizon reels

drunkenly around them.  Spider-Man hangs on by his

fingertips; waldo-fists slam into his hands, shattering the

glass.




INT.  BIOLOGY LAB - DAY


Liz hurtles across the slanted room, furniture and laboratory

equipment crash toward her as she crawls up the floor toward

a wall of windows.  A case of formaldehyde-filled bottles

SMASHES inches from her head, spilling grisly preserved

specimens.  She suppresses a scream, keeping her wits about

her.




EXT.  SCIENCE CENTER -DAY


The building hovers and pitches unstabely in mid-air.


Spidey rips loose a drainpipe to defend himself against Ock's

arms:  a bizarre sword duel ensues, a ten-foot pipe vs. four

metal tentacles.


The building pitches violently in the opposite direction.




INT.  BIOLOGY LAB - DAY


Everything that's not tied down falls across the room and

SMASHES past Liz through the windows, which now face down on

New York-- a mile below.




EXT. SCIENCE CENTER -DAY


The building spins, debris spills out the window.


Ock lands a hard blow to Spider-Man's jaw. Stunned, Spidey

hugs the wall.


Ock claws his way across the brick surface to finish him off.


Behind Ock, Liz tumbles through an open window, clutching at

Venetian blinds.  She releases a pent-up SCREAM of terror,

dangling a mile above ground.


SPIDER-MAN

Liz!


He seizes the offensive, swings at Ock with the drainpipe.


The building reels, vertical walls nearly upright.


Spidey heaves the drainpipe like a javelin, hitting Ock in

the belly.  The pipe hurtles downward.  Double-jets of

webbing shoot out to cover Ock's livid face.


Spider-Man swings around Ock toward Liz, shoots webbing to

secure her to the face of the building.


Spider-Man dodges and ducks the flailing waldos, weaving a

web to bind them to the wall.  More and more web-fluid-- the

net draws tighter.


SPIDER-MAN

You could use a nice, long rest.


At last near enough to Ock's body, Spidey clips him with a

quick blow-- he's out.  Spider-Man scrambles to Liz and pulls

her inside.




INT.  EXPERIMENTAL CHAMBER - DAY


Roz runs from one bank of controls to another.  Spider-Man

and Liz enter from the control room.


ROZ

What's she doing here?


LIZ

This building is flying.  I'm in a

flying building


SPIDER-MAN

Professor, you ever fly one of

these things before?


ROZ

Sure, in the war.  Pull those

cables--


Spider-Man runs across to the transformer, now glowing less

brightly.  He pulls a thick electrical cable-- the cyclotron

GROANS, the PULSE diminishes further.  Spider-Man grabs

another cable.


ROZ

One at a time!  We'll drop like a

bomb!


Spider-Man lets go as if it were red-hot.




EXT. SCIENCE CENTER -- DAY


Some energy streams sputter into nothingness.  The building

gently descends toward the clouds below.




INT.  EXPERIMENTAL CHAMBER - DAY


Liz watches as Spider-Man and Roz work together.


LIZ

I'm in a goddamn flying building...


The PULSE in the floor "unspreads" toward the focusing cone.


Liz's earrings flutter-- the fly off her ears, sailing to the

curved wall of the cyclotron.  Other metal objects-- pliers,

a welder's torch, etc.-- join them there.


ROZ

Magnetism-- phase one.  We're

returning to normal.


Ock's waldos ERUPT through the floor.  Seething, he pulls

himself into the room, loose strands of webbing hanging from

his face and arms.


SPIDER-MAN

(exasperated)

Oh, come on!


All four waldos surge out at Spider-Man.  He barely leaps

away, a waldo lashes after him and pulls loose another

electrical cable--


-- the room pitches


-- Liz and Roz fall to the floor, she pulls Roz away from the

glow.


-- Spider-Man leaps to the ceiling above the cyclotron.  Ock

strikes out-- the magnetism sucks an arm against the

accelerator tube and holds it fast.


-- The Pulse shrinks further to an area below the focusing

cone.


-- Ock's remaining arms strike madly at Spider-Man, Roz,

everything.


-- A waldo crosses the beam of power from the focusing cone--

concentric rings of energy shoot down the length of the arm--

the waldo BURSTS APART, scattering wire and metal.


-- Ock YOWLS in pain, a two-foot remnant of a waldo flops

limply at his torso.


-- Spider-Man leaps to the ceiling above the focusing cone.


SPIDER-MAN

Up here, Docky Ocky!


ROZ

(desperately)

No, no!  Not there!


-- Ock's remaining two waldo arms thrust madly at Spider-Man--

he springs away.


-- The waldos SMASH the cone.


-- Unearthly SOUNDS.


-- The fibrous BLUE WHITE BEAM envelops Doc Ock's entire

body.


-- A dark, completely alien slit opens in space where the

focusing cone had been.


-- The widening gap draws Ock into its weird Beyond. He

reaches toward it with his human hands.


-- Liz & Spider-Man struggle to resist the gap's pull.  Roz

watches in horror as--


-- Ock's body warps, twists inside itself.  He HOWLS-- agony,

pleasure, enlightenment, death.


-- The gap implodes Doc Ock's body and...


-- disappears, closing and sucking the last of the energy and

PULSE into it.


Eerie silence, except for the growing WHISTLE of air.


ROZ

(hushed)

He found his truth.


LIZ

We're falling...


SPIDER-MAN

Okay, I blew it-- let's move!




EXT. SCIENCE CENTER- DAY


The energy has completely disappeared. The building plummets

into the clouds.




INT. SCIENCE CENTER  HALLWAY - DAY


Spider-Man and Roz help Liz toward the staircase.  The WIND

WHISTLES louder as gravity accelerates the plunge.




EXT.  SKYLINE - DAY


The Science Center falls out of the clouds toward Central

Park.




INT.  STAIRCASE - DAY


Pitching and rolling, Spider-Man, Roz and Liz move

weightlessly up to the emergency exit.




EXT.  SCIENCE CENTER - DAY


The door swings open in the hurricane wind.  Fire

extinguishers and other objects are sucked past the trio,

they leap away from the building--


SPIDER-MAN

Hold tight, kids!




EXT.  CENTRAL PARK - DAY


Central Park accelerates toward them as they plunge to earth.


The Science Center disintegrates on impact with Central Park

Lake.




EXT.  SKY - DAY


Falling, with Liz hanging onto his neck, Roz under one arm,

Spider-Man shoots webbing downward--




EXT.  CLEOPATRA'S NEEDLE - DAY


-- to the top of the obelisk--


-- and swings gracefully down in a spiral around the

monument.


He touches ground, sets Roz and Liz on their feet.  They look

around  them:




EXT.  CENTRAL PARK - DAY


A hailstorm of debris-- papers, books, bottles, bricks.  The

lake's surface churns and calms.




EXT.  CLEOPATRA'S NEEDLE - DAY


The trio stands for a moment, stunned.  Liz's knees buckle as

she faints.  Spider-man catches her.


SPIDER-MAN

I can handle it.


He hefts her into his arms and walks off into the gathering

crowd.




INT.  LECTURE HALL CORRIDOR - DAY


Norb and Chip leans against the wall, hanging out. They read

a copy of the Times.  The bold headline:  "SCIENTISTS EXPLAIN

TORNADO/ EARTHQUAKE/ELECTRICAL STORM."  Flash swaggers up,

swacks their Times with a copy of the Bugle.


FLASH

Use that to wrap fish.  I got the

real story.


He shows them the tacky Bugle headline:  "SPIDER-MAN SAVES

UNIVERSE."  Chip and Norb break up laughing.  Students pour

out of a classroom behind them.


FLASH

Hey!  This is the truth!  Look, Doc

Ock had this, uh, experiment thing,

and the Science Center crashed into

Central Park, and--


He spots Peter and Harry, holds up the Bugle.


FLASH

Parker, Osborn--true, am I right?


PETER

(bemused)

Oh, of course.


HARRY

I was there.


FLASH

See?


HARRY

(wild-eyed)

Or was it all a dream?


Peter and Harry laugh and head out the door.




EXT.  LECTURE HALL - DAY


They walk out and past the boarded-off pit that was the

Science Center.


HARRY

Oh, I need your notes from the

classes I missed.


PETER

Well, I've missed a lot of classes

myself...


HARRY

Oh. Well, hang in there, amigo.


He crosses away.  Roz catches up to Peter from the lecture

hall.


ROZ

Peter-- I'm so very proud of you. 

I must apologize for doubting that

you could do it.


Peter eyes him, wondering what he knows.  Roz eyes him back.


ROZ

The paper, my boy.  A solid B-plus.


PETER

Oh. Yeah.  Thanks.


ROZ

If you really apply yourself,

you'll get an A next time.


Roz smiles wisely.  Peter watches him walk off.


PETER

Next time...


The idea of doing it all again makes Peter whistle lowly.  He

sees someone across the street.




EXT.  WASHINGTON SQUARE PARK - DAY


Smiling, Peter runs up to Liz.


PETER

Hello, Liz.


LIZ

Hello.  So very boring.  Peter

Parker, how do you feel about me

this morning?


PETER

I... I like you.  A lot.


LIZ

Hm.  Well, I like you, too.  I like

your aunt.  I like your shoelaces. 

I like--


He holds a fingertip to her lips.


PETER

Hold it.  Can we stop being clever,

just for a moment?


LIZ

Why?


He kisses her.  She looks at him bittersweetly.


LIZ

This may be the end of a beautiful

friendship, you know.


PETER

Nah.


She kisses him back.  They walk off into the park, holding

hands... and we


FADE OUT.
