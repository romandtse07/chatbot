    "In writing fiction, the more fantastic 
    the tale, the plainer the prose should be. Don't ask your readers to 
    admire your words when you want them to believe your story." -

--==[ WHITE CHRISTMAS LYRICS ]==--



THE OLD MAN

We'll follow the old man wherever he wants to go

Long as he wants to go opposite to the foe


We'll stay with the old man wherever he wants to stay

Long as he stays away from the battle's fray


Because we love him, we love him

Especially when he keeps us on the ball


And we'll tell the kiddies we answered duty's call

With the grandest son of a soldier of them all



SISTERS

Sisters, sisters, there were never such devoted sisters

Never had to have a chaperone, "No sir"

I'm there to keep my eye on her


Caring, sharing ev'ry little thing that we are wearing

When a certain gentleman arrived from Rome

She wore the dress and I stayed home


All kinds of weather, we stick together, the same in the rain or sun

Two diff'rent faces, but in tight places, we think and we act as one


Those who've seen us know that not a thing could come between us

Many men have tried to split us up, but no one can

Lord help the mister who comes between me and my sister

And Lord help the sister who comes between me and my man


[Male version, not in film]

Brothers, brothers, there were never such devoted brothers

When there comes a glamour girl who's nice and trim

He watches me and I watch him


Caring, sharing, ev'ry little thing that we are wearing

When a certain signorina came from Rome

He wore the blue serge, I stayed home


All kinds of weather, we stick together, the same in the rain or sun

Two diff'rent faces, but in tight places, we think and we act as one


Those who've seen us know that not a thing could come between us

Many girls have tried to split us up, but no one shall

Lord help another who comes between me and my brother

And Lord help the brother who comes between me and my gal



COUNT YOUR BLESSINGS INSTEAD OF SHEEP

When I'm worried and I can't sleep

I count my blessings instead of sheep

And I fall asleep

Counting my blessings


When my bankroll is getting small

I think of when I had none at all

And I fall asleep

Counting my blessings


I think about a nursery and I picture curly heads

And one by one I count them as they slumber in their beds


If you're worried and you can't sleep

Just count your blessings instead of sheep

And you'll fall asleep

Counting your blessings



WHAT CAN YOU DO WITH A GENERAL?

[verse]

When the war was over, why, there were jobs galore

For the G.I. Josephs who were in the war

But for generals things were not so grand

And it's not so hard to understand


[refrain]

What can you do with a general

When he stops being a general?

Oh, what can you do with a general who retires?


Who's got a job for a general

When he stops being a general?

They all get a job but a general no one hires 


They fill his chest with medals while he's across the foam

And they spread the crimson carpet when he comes marching home

The next day someone hollers when he comes into view

"Here comes the general" and they all say "General who?"

They're delighted that he came

But they can't recall his name


Nobody thinks of assigning him

When they stop wining and dining him

It seems this country never has enjoyed

So many one and two and three and four star generals

Unemployed



LOVE, YOU DIDN'T DO RIGHT BY ME

Love, you didn't do right by me

You planned a romance that just hadn't a chance

And I'm through


Love, you didn't do right by me

I'm back on the shelf and I'm blaming myself

But it's you


My one love affair didn't get anywhere from the start

To send me a Joe who had winter and snow in his heart

Wasn't smart


Love, you didn't do right by me

As they say in the song

"You done me wrong!"


[Alternate line for male:]

To send me a Jane who had thunder and rain in her heart



GEE, I WISH I WAS BACK IN THE ARMY

[verse]

When I was mustered out

I thought without a doubt

That I was through with All my care and strife

I thought that I was then

The happiest of men

But after months of tough civilian life


[1st refrain]

Gee, I wish I was back in the Army

The Army wasn't really bad at all

Three meals a day

For which you didn't pay

Uniforms for winter, spring and fall


There's a lot to be said for the Army

The life without responsibility

A soldier out of luck

Was really never stuck

There's always someone higher up where you can pass the buck

Oh, gee, I wish I was back in the Army


[2nd refrain]

Gee, I wish I was back in the Army

The Army was the place to find romance

Soldiers and WACS

The WACS who dressed in slacks

Dancing cheek to cheek and pants to pants


There's a lot to be said for the Army

A gal was never lost for company

A million handsome guys

With longing in their eyes

And all you had to do was pick the age, the weight, the size

Oh, gee, I wish I was back in the Army


[3rd refrain]

Gee, I wish I was back in the Army

The shows we got civilians couldn't see

How we would yell for Dietrich and Cornell

Jolson, Hope and Benny all for free


[alternate line from sheet music]

Crosby, Hope and Jolson all for free


There's a lot to be said for the Army

The best of doctors watched you carefully

A dentist and a clerk

For weeks and weeks they'd work

They'd make a thousand dollar job and give it to a jerk

Oh, gee, I wish I was back in the Army



A MAN CHASES A GIRL (UNTIL SHE CATCHES HIM)

A man chases a girl until she catches him

He runs after a girl until he's caught

He fishes for a girl until she's landed him

It all comes out exactly the way she thought


Uncertain, he tags along behind

Uncertain, till she makes up his mind


A man chases a girl until she catches him

But don't run too fast while you are saying "No"

And once you've caught him, don't ever let him go



BELLS

[verse]

Very many years ago

Mister Edgar Allan Poe

Wrote a little poem I know

Called "Bells"

When I read those clever rhymes

Of the many different chimes

I could almost hear them ringing

Ding dong dinging


[refrain]

Phone bells, sleigh bells

And very merry Christmas day bells


The brazen fire bells that ring with fear

And happy New Year bells that ring out once a year


Cow bells, door bells

For All I know there may be more bells

But the poet tells

That wedding bells

Have the sweetest little ding dong of All



WHITE CHRISTMAS

[verse not in film]

The sun is shining, the grass is green

The orange and palm trees sway

I've never seen such a day

In Beverly Hills, L.A.

But it's December the twenty-fourth

And I am longing to be up north


[refrain]

I'm dreaming of a white Christmas

Just like the ones I used to know


Where the treetops glisten and children listen

To hear sleigh bells in the snow


I'm dreaming of white Christmas

With every Christmas card I write


May your days be merry and bright
