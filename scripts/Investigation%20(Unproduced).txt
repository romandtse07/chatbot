"INVESTIGATION"


Screenplay by


Paul Schrader


1987 Draft Script


UNPRODUCED




INT. PARKING STRUCTURE - DAY


JUDE MAZZO, United States Attorney for the District of 

Columbia, 45, trim, dark full hair. Hey, Jude. It's a name 

you remember. It sticks in mind. Jude the Obscure.


Jude Mazzo adjusts his tailored suit, crosses underground 

structure. The first thing you notice is the walk. The Jude 

walk. Something between a stroll and a strut. The balls of 

his feet carry his weight effortlessly; his heels follow, 

scrapping the concrete in precise hypnotic rhythm. The walk 

of confidence. His walk presumes order in the space through 

which it moves, creates an allusion of order if none exists. 

It says: this space has purpose because I am passing through 

it.


This isn't the confidence of unthought arrogance. It's the 

considered arrogance of a leader. People want order; they 

crave it like bread or water. Those who create order are 

avatars, above judgement or suspicion. Their walk, their 

bearing, the echoing sound of their approaching footsteps 

are manna for the masses.


* Mazzo unlocks his metallic navy blue 1987 Beretta, sits 

in. Stereo blasts "Chantilly Lace," Big Bopper's 1959 rock 

hit, as he revs engine. Telephone RINGS from speakers. The 

Big Bopper answers in ersatz negroid:


"CHANTILLY LACE"

(jaunty)

"Hel-lo, ba-by,

Yeah, this is the Big Bopper speakin'

(demonic laugh)

O-oh, you sweet thang! Do I what?

Will I what?

O-oh, ba-by, You kno-ow what I like!"


Jude squeals off. Sometimes it's not enough to be a born 

leader. Sometimes you gotta flaunt it.


CUT TO:


EXT. RESIDENTIAL STREET - DAY


Grey structures squat behind iron gates and lush magnolias. 

Mazzo's coupe approaches, parks between dark sedans. Jude 

gets out, tightens his silk tie as he steps toward sidewalk. 

The tie's just the right touch, obtrusive yet elegant: a sky 

blue gash neck to navel.


Mazzo turns at corner, continues down sidewalk. The score 

picks up where "Chantilly Lace" cuts off. Music surrounds 

Jude, always pulsing, pushing forward. Screen credits 

continue.


CUT TO:


EXT. KARIN'S APT. BLDG. - DAY


Jude steps into shadow of six-story Post-modern condominium 

complex. Enters.


CUT TO:


INT. LOBBY - DAY


Steps to elevator, presses button. Hawaiian paintings adorn 

far wall.


CUT TO:


INT. FIFTH FLOOR - DAY


Exits elevator, looks both directions. Hallway empty. Jude 

walks softly to 5C. He pauses outside door; he pats his hair 

in place, straightens suit and tie.


Jude removes key from coat pocket, unlocks door slowly, 

silently. He tiptoes inside.


CUT TO:


INT. KARIN'S LIVING ROOM - DAY


Jude enters silently. Chain-latches door.


Jude surveys room with familiar eyes. The only light comes 

from drawn yellowed window shades; thin strips of exterior 

green foliage glow underneath.


The decor jumps out at you: an eclectic jungle of plants and 

paisley. A wall cluttered with clippings butts into a verdure 

tapestry. Second Empire chaise strewn with books. Cheap salsa 

music enhances Green Mansions effect.


One thing is certain: a woman lives here. Intellectual: 

definitely. Young: probably. Impulsive: compulsively.


Light shines from open bedroom. Sheets rustle within. Mazzo 

lowers salsa muzak, enters. Screen credits continue.


CUT TO:


INT. KARIN'S BEDROOM - DAY


KARIN SCHREIBER, 25, wrapped in pink bed sheet, approaches 

Jude seductively. Dirty blond hair, pale complexion. Either 

Dutch or German. She could be a model.


Karin opens sheet, drapes it shroud-like over Jude's 

shoulders. He glimpses her nudity. She smiles:


KARIN

(teasing)

How will you kill me today?


JUDE

I'll slit your throat.


END CREDITS


Jude removes his blue tie, turns on large TV directly facing 

Karin's bed. He dials cable box to C-Span: hearings live 

from Capitol Hill -- on screen, inaudible, some duly elected 

asshole pontificates. Karin sits on mattress, stretches.


Jude removes suit jacket, folds it over chair, rhythmnically 

weaves sex fantasy scenario:


JUDE

It's a political scandal. Misused 

funds. Pivot this way, toward the 

TV. Kinky sex, ruined career, media 

rumors, ridicule -- the Senator was 

one of the most respected on the 

Hill...

(Karin swivels)

...yes, just like that. Member of 

the Judicial Committee. Considered 

above reproach.


Karin lies facing foot of bed. Random mirrors reflect all 

four walls. Erotic painting of elaborate coitus, executed in 

Soviet Social Realist style, hangs beside rack of nightgowns. 

Stained glass lamps, oddly placed, provide pastel light. 

This is boudoir, not bedroom.


Karin watches Mazzo disrobe. He places dress shoes -- black, 

polished, Italian -- neatly under chair, tucks Picasso pattern 

socks inside. Folds, stacks shirt and trousers. Karin fluffs 

her pillow.


Jude removes bikini briefs, tucks them from sight, slips in 

bed. Karin welcomes him with a smile.


CUT TO:


INT. KARIN'S BEDROOM - DAY


TIMECUT: salsa music BLARES from stereo. Jude and Karin fuck 

energetically atop wide oceanic bed. Panting, they change 

positions, restart. TV casts cathode glow across bed.


Karin, astride Jude, silhouetted in C-Span. She grips his 

buttocks, guides penal thrusts. Her breath quickens. His 

panting breaths echo. She digs her fingers into Mazzo's 

thighs.


Jude's hands rise along her torso. Karin shivers at onset of 

orgasm. She elongates her climax with slow crescendoing 

SCREAM, each octave a new plateau of pleasure. Karin's voice 

fades as she slumps forward, GASPING. Her chest flattens 

upon his. She wheezes, then stops.


Mazzo pulls himself up beside her -- only then do we notice 

the blood across his chest and face. Karin is dead. Her throat 

has been slit. Jude eases Karin's body to sheets as he swings 

his legs to floor. He stands pulling sheet around waist. 

Karin watches blank-eyed in pool of blood.


Jude waddles from bedroom.


CUT TO:


INT. KARIN'S BATHROOM - DAY


Jude showers. Blood washes down drain.


CUT TO:


INT. KARIN'S BEDROOM - DAY


Mazzo, wrapped in sheet, returns to Karin's bed. He rumages 

through bloodied bed covers until he finds safety razor blade, 

the murder weapon. He hardly notices Karin. Jude wipes razor 

blade on bed cover, walks away.


CUT TO:


INT. KARIN'S KITCHEN - DAY


Jude takes a glass from cupboard, opens refrigerator door. 

He removes, uncaps bottle of dry vermouth. He fingers the 

glass as he fills it. Jude lifts vermouth to his lips, 

swallows, shivers.


CUT TO:


INT. KARIN'S LIVING ROOM - DAY


Mazzo enters with bottle and glass, walks to windows. He 

raises a center shade, looks outside: traffic passes in 

sunlight. He steps to bookshelf, turns off stereo. The salsa 

stops.


Weary, Jude lowers himself onto Karin's sofa. He lies still, 

wrapped in sheet, cradling vermouth bottle and glass, staring 

at ceiling. Jude's eyes close. He slips lightly to sleep.


CUT TO:


INT. KARIN'S BEDROOM - DAY


TIMECUT: 30 minutes later. Jude is awake and dressed, his 

spirits replenished. Music score sets him in motion.


Mazzo puts on Sahara-brown suit coat as he crosses to bureau. 

Blue silk tie hangs loose around his neck.


He pulls white handkerchief from pocket, wraps it around 

right hand. He opens bureau drawer with covered hand, leaving 

no fingerprints. Inside, Karin's cash and jewelry lie amid 

personal possessions.


Mazzo lifts inlaid box, sets it down. He flips through folded 

tens and twenties, puts money back, then examines antique 

jade and silver necklace. Jude pauses to review his strategy. 

He carefully wraps handkerchief around necklace, places 

necklace in coat pocket.


Jude turns to bed where Karin lies twisted in the covers -- 

still but still beautiful. He pulls tie from neck, turns it 

over.


He crouches beside Karin, lifts her hand. Jude gingerly drags 

the silk tie across Karin's long fingernails. A blue thread 

catches under her index finger. He pulls tie away, releases 

her hand. Karin's fingers reflexively curl around the sky 

blue thread.


CUT TO:


INT. KARIN'S KITCHEN - DAY


Jude enters tying tie.


He presses his shoe against tile floor, then raises foot to 

reveal faint bloody footprint. He steps again, leaving fainter 

and fainter footfalls.


Jude lifts receiver from wall phone, dials number from memory. 

He squats against wall, receiver pressed to his ear. He waits, 

fiddles impatiently. Paperback books are stacked everywhere. 

Someone finally answers. Jude speaks with cadence of one 

conditioned to command:


JUDE

Hello?

(pause)

Hello. Homicide, please.

(pause)

They ought to be answering, unless 

they're asleep. A girl has been 

murdered.

(pause)

A girl was killed, I tell you!

(pause)

2085 M Street.

(pause)

M Street, not N Street, you idiot!

(pause)

Who was she? Karin Schreiber. On the 

fifth floor.

(pause)

You got all that? Read it back to 

me.


Mazzo listens, nods, checks watch. Satisfied, he stands to 

hang up phone. It's time to go.


He turns back to frig, opens door. Jude removes bottle of 

Moet champagne, tucks it under his arm. He walks away, leaving 

refrigerator door ajar.


CUT TO:


INT. LOBBY - DAY


Jude exits elevator, walks to main entrance. His eyes flit 

side to side. Otherwise, his face's a blank mask.


The front door opens as Mazzo reaches for handle. He's 

suddenly face to face with RIA MALED, 24, about to enter. 

They freeze. Have they met? Do they know each other?


Ria's dressed chic/casual. Either Arab or Italian. Slightly 

built with piercing eyes. Suspicious type -- like those 

longtime students who never graduate.


RIA

Excuse me.


JUDE

Huh?


RIA

Excuse me, please, I'd like to get 

through.


JUDE

Sorry.


Mazzo steps back as Ria passes. Jude exits, proceeds to 

sidewalk. Ria pauses in lobby to watch him. No doubt: he 

knows our Jude.


CUT TO:


EXT. JUSTICE DEPT. - DAY


* MOVING POV from inside Jude's Beretta: Justice Dept. complex 

looms immediately ahead. Washington D.C. Capitol Dome crowns 

the six-story skyline.


The Justice Department, built 1931-35, a monumental Art Deco 

structure halfway between the Capital and the White House. 

It's granite facade is richly decorated with columns, friezes 

and inscriptions. Military personnel patrol the sidewalks. 

All visitors are screened. D.C. seems under siege. Pink plexi 

sign at entrance warns: "Caution, Power Doors Swing Out."


The FBI Building, 1974, Hoover's monolith, engulfs the 

neighboring block. Its brutal design dwarfs human scale and 

feeling.


SCREENWRITER'S NOTE: Special consideration is given to 

architecture throughout the script. The story is set in visual 

brave new world. Post-modern structures, such as Washington 

Harbour (under construction), U.S. News, Westin and Grand 

hotels, are favored. International Style buildings are also 

prefered: L'Enfant Plaza, AFL-CIO, FBI headquarters. 

Architecture of film need not be beautiful, it need only be 

new. Historic Washington is irrelevant. Jude Mazzo's a new 

creation; he needs new space.


CUT TO:


INT. JUDE'S JUSTICE DEPT. OFFICE - DAY


White collar workers crowd impressive corner office 

overlooking Pennsylvania Avenue. No flies on this bunch: 

they exude self-righteousness of underlings on the rise. 

Today's idealists aching to be tomorrow's bureaucrats.


A mounted Justice Dept. seal, flanked by U.S. flags, sets 

the tone. Grid of framed photos feature Mazzo posing with 

politicians past and present. Two objects stand out from the 

government-issue decor: a bright Memphis chair and 

Neoexpressionist map of D.C. Just the right hip.


The office workers watch CNN. Generic NEWSCASTER speaks framed 

by blue screen pic of smoking subway platform. Bloodied woman 

lies in photo foreground.


CNN NEWSCASTER

...The government has taken great 

pains to remain calm throughout the 

crisis, convinced any appearance of 

panic would only encourage terrorists. 

The President conducted business as 

usual as pressure for action continues 

to mount in the wake of the Statue 

of Liberty bombing...


* CNN cuts to file footage of bleeding, frightened tourists 

streaming from smoke-filled entrance to Statue of Liberty. 

Paramedics and police hustle them away under glare of TV 

cameras.


CNN NEWSCASTER

...Rumors of the U.S. response are 

the talk of Washington. This we now 

know for certain: the Attorney General 

will announce, perhaps as soon as 

tomorrow, the formation of an ad-hoc 

anti-terrorism agency, an elite inter-

departmental unit headed by an anti-

terrorism "czar." The name most 

mentioned...


YOUNG JUSTICE EMPLOYEE improvs dramatic drum roll.


CNN NEWSCASTER

...is that of Jude Mazzo, the high 

profile United States District 

Attorney from the District of 

Columbia. Steve Dunn has compiled a 

background report on Attorney Mazzo. 

Steve --


REPORTER DUNN narrates bio over clips from Mazzo's career. 

They include:


-- Jude as young lawyer on courthouse steps.


-- Jude unveils chart of underworld crime activities.


-- Jude sworn in.


-- Jude, in leather jacket and jeans, tells of undercover 

drug buy.


-- Jude receives VFW commendation.


-- Jude at White House reception.


-- Jude jumping from helicopter, followed by FBI.


Clips cover five years. In early footage, Jude's dress and 

manner are bland. Later, he's the opposite: snazzy, confident, 

charismatic.


REPORTER DUNN (O.S.)

...first burst on the scene with his 

vigorous organized crime and drug 

prosecutions, breaking all the 

unwritten rules. The politicos all 

stood their distance, waiting for 

Mazzo to take his fall. Instead, 

came a wave of convictions. Not 

surprisingly, Mazzo turned his 

attention to city corruption. Within 

eight months, 16 state and local 

officials had resigned...


Mazzo's cohorts joke, wisecrack to screen. Jude's very much 

a hero here -- both loved and respected.


REPORTER DUNN (O.S.)

...Even those opposed to the new 

agency seem to have no objections 

concerning Attorney Mazzo. He is, in 

the words of the President, "an 

American hero."


Door opens. All eyes turn.


Jude strides in, Moet bottle under his arm. Office staff 

bursts into spontaneous applause. Mazzo pops cork, sending 

spray across room. He speaks rapid-fire:


JUDE

Get some glasses, they're in the 

cupboard -- not too many. And turn 

that thing off. Sandy? I'll never 

understand how seemingly intelligent 

people who spend their days planting 

stories and manipulating coverage 

can turn around, flip on the news, 

sit there and watch it like God was 

sending it down fresh from Mt. Sinai. 

Manna!

(looks)

Great, over here.


YOUNG OFFICE WORKER distributes plastic glasses as SANDY, an 

"Executive Assistant," turns off TV. Jude spills champagne 

as he pours from glass to glass.


YOUNG OFFICE EMPLOYEE

Congratulations, sir.


Others echo congratulations. Jude pours:


JUDE

Here, here. Thank you.

(suddenly harsh)

Stop!


They all freeze. Awkward silence.


JUDE

This is no time for celebration.

(pauses for effect)

And you can quote me on that.


Jude breaks into laugh, takes swig. Impromptu party resumes. 

Staff divides into threes and fours.


ALAN, 29, speaks with fellow EXECUTIVE ASSISTANT out of 

earshot:


ALAN

Who's Mazzo taking to the new agency?


EXECUTIVE ASSISTANT

Get in line: that's what everybody 

wants to know. That's where the 

action's gonna be. And Jude ain't 

talking.


Jude, working crowd, approaches:


ALAN

We're going to miss you.


EXECUTIVE ASSISTANT

It won't be the same.


JUDE

I'll be around. You can't get rid of 

me that easy. Besides, Milton will 

step right in.


EXECUTIVE ASSISTANT

It won't be the same.


SECOND EXECUTIVE ASSISTANT joins them. Jude turns to him:


JUDE

What's green with four legs and does 

impressions?


ALAN

(to 2nd Ass't)

Don't answer.


JUDE

I want it on my desk in the morning. 

Clayton, right?

(walks off)


ALAN

That's how he gets his jokes.


Jude steps beside ASSISTANT U.S. ATTORNEY AVERY MILTON, Jude's 

right-hand man and confidant. Ass't Attorney Milton, late 

fifties, seems more suited to office than courtroom. He's 

quite content to stand in Jude's shadow.


MILTON

So, congratulations once again.


JUDE

Thanks, Milt.


Mazzo, smiling, calls to unseen staff member:


JUDE

You're coming with me, don't forget!


Milton suppresses sting of slight: he hasn't been asked. 

Nearby, TWO ATTORNEYS dish breaking murder:


1ST ATTORNEY

...it's this really hot babe. You 

know, sweater meat for miles. Embassy 

connections all over. The whole 

package. Zapped.


2ND ATTORNEY

The Thai girl -- ?


1ST ATTORNEY

No way Homicide get this juiced over 

a gook. They're 'Nam-heads --


Mazzo and Milton walk over. Second Attorney brightens, fawns:


2ND ATTORNEY

You hear this, boss? Gorgeous girl, 

diplomatic connections, then zi-ip --

(throat cut gesture)

Page one all the way.


1ST ATTORNEY

No other marks on body. Mint condition 

from the neck down.


JUDE

Where's this from?


1ST ATTORNEY

Precinct gossip. Real sketchy. We're 

gonna get called in -- to check out 

the "political angle." Probably 

banging Embassy Row like Mother 

Theresa --


2ND ATTORNEY

(correcting)

-- Mata Hari --


JUDE

(cuts in)

Where?


2ND ATTORNEY

N Street. Two thousand something.


JUDE

(disgusted)

What did your brain do while your 

dick was going to law school? 2000 N 

is a vacant lot! And don't be so 

fast to jump to judgement.

(calls to others)

There's only one guilty person around 

here!


All stop silent. Second Attorney shrivels in pinstripes, his 

career hanging by a thread. Jude laughs:


JUDE

And that's me!


Two Attorneys, relieved, join laughter. Mazzo resumes 

conversation with First Attorney:


JUDE

They want us there? The Justice 

Department?


1ST ATTORNEY

That's what I hear. Request en route.


JUDE

(to Milton)

Well, let's dig it out. Thank God, I 

thought I was going to have to spend 

my last day here drinking champagne -- 

I don't even like champagne. Com'on, 

Milt, let's go.


They walk off. Second Attorney turns to First:


2ND ATTORNEY

Tell me I'm wrong. Tell me I didn't 

fuck my promotion.

(slaps head)

Damn!

* Beretta coupe exits wrought deco gates, heads west on 9th 

past FBI Building. Black-on-white Justice Dept. license plates 

distinguish Jude's coupe from surrounding cars.


CUT TO:


EXT. KARIN'S APT. - NIGHT


Jude/Milton MOVING POV inside car: 2085 M Street appears 

amid flashing red and yellow lights. D.C. police cordon off 

reporters and onlookers. TWO PARAMEDICS rest against 

ambulance, as if awaiting instructions.


* PATROLMAN recognizes Jude as Beretta parks. He escorts 

Mazzo and Milton through crowd as pushing newsmen call, "Judi, 

Judi." Mazzo acknowledges photo flashbulbs as he enters.


CUT TO:


INT. KARIN'S LIVING ROOM - NIGHT


"Evidence Gathering Technicians" take notes, collect 

fingerprints, label evidence. Policeman crosses from living 

room to kitchen. No one seems in a hurry. Faint red light 

flashes below partially drawn window shade.


Two plainclothes officials chat casually near bedroom door. 

DECT. GILBERT GIDEON, 48, FBI, speaks in tones befitting 

seniority. LT. MICHAEL WEISS, 37, District of Columbia 

Homicide Division, listens to Gideon, defers, smiles. Both 

men, conservatively dressed, exude careerism: intense, 

intelligent, well-exercised.


Jude's arrival causes immediate stir. They've been waiting 

for him. Mazzo nods to others as he and Milton join Gideon 

and Weiss, exchange handshakes:


DECT. GIDEON

Thanks for coming yourself, Mr. 

Attorney. I know you're busy. You 

know Lt. Weiss, D.C. Homicide -- ?


JUDE

(nods)

What took you so long to call in the 

request, Gideon?

(to Weiss)

Just look, Lieutenant, and hope you 

never know the hell of a FBI man 

asking for help --


DECT. GIDEON

(defensive)

The Bureau can't afford mistakes. I 

had to be certain of the foreign 

policy ramifications. Then we found 

this. Look.


Gideon takes bound leather address book from shelf, hands it 

to Mazzo:


DECT. GIDEON

Her address book: diplomats, lefties, 

lobbyists -- goddamn Who's Who. Just 

look at the first name under "B." 

Your name is even in there.


LT. WEISS

She cut out clippings of political 

events, terrorist incidents, the New 

York subway bomb --


JUDE

That too?


LT. WEISS

Post.


JUDE

Where is she?


DECT. GIDEON

In the bedroom.


JUDE

Let's take a look.


CUT TO:


INT. KARIN'S BEDROOM - NIGHT


Jude and others enter "boudoir" as Technicians collate 

evidence. Jude, expressionless, scans room as if seeing it 

for the first time. Adjusts his tie.


Bed furnishings, measured, labeled, remain as before. Karin's 

body lies unmoved under pink sheets.


LT. WEISS

Karin Schreiber, 24, Dutch passport.


Jude pauses at portable tape player atop TV, depresses "play" 

lever. Tape hiss followed by phone RING. Big Bopper answers 

from two-inch speakers: "Hel-lo, ba-by. Yeah, this is the 

Big Bopper Speakin.'"


JUDE

Pull back the sheets.


Mazzo watches as EVIDENCE GATHERING TECHNICIAN #1 unveils 

Karin's body. Dry blood forms Rorschach stain beside her 

neck. Jude tilts his head to study corpse: very sexy, very 

Madame Tussard.


DECT. GIDEON

Clean razor wound. No trace of the 

murder weapon.


JUDE

Cover her up. Who's name was the 

apartment in?


Mazzo steps into bathroom, turns shower nozzle on and off. 

Gideon ejects "Chantilly Lace" as others observe from bedroom.


LT. WEISS

Hers. The victim.


JUDE

The neighbor?


LT. WEISS

A doctor... A man completely above 

suspicion. The other apartment vacant --


JUDE

And who gets everything? The husband?


LT. WEISS

Separated three years.


Mazzo examines tile floor; pink stain washes down drain.


JUDE

Bring him in for questioning.


Weiss eyeballs Gideon: whose case is it? D.C.P.D. or FBI? 

Mazzo retraces steps through bedroom:


JUDE

Who's conducting the investigation?


LT. WEISS

Homicide --


DECT. GIDEON

FBI.


LT. WEISS

D.C. Homicide will continue its 

investigation.


Gideon shrugs. Local cops are Gumbies in FBI world view. 

Mazzo continues into kitchen.


DECT. GIDEON

Her address book?


CUT TO:


INT. KARIN'S KITCHEN - NIGHT


Jude opens refrigerator door:


JUDE

Keep it. I want no coverup.


EVIDENCE GATHERING TECHNICIAN #2 approaches with stack of 

black-and-white glossies.


TECHNICIAN #2

(eager)

Look, the victim posed for these 

crime scene photographs. Like some 

cheap magazine. Obviously taken by 

an amateur.


Technician displays 8x10 "crime scene" stills. In each Karin 

Schreiber is the "victim." Jude's eyes fix on photos. They 

feature:


-- Karin, fully clothed, slumped against toilet bowl.


-- Karin, in bra and panties, face-down on carpet, plastic 

fish in her mouth.


-- Karin, wearing only mini-skirt, draped over bed. Her body 

covered with record albums and tapes.


Laughing VOICES initiate flashback.


CUT TO:


INT. KARIN'S BEDROOM - DAY -FLASHBACK-


A year before. Jude and Karin at play, laughing as they stage 

"crime scene" photos. Big Bopper sings on stereo.


Mazzo, hair tussled, wields Nikon like work tool. Barefoot, 

he wears white shirt, dark trousers. He's ten pounds heavier. 

Karin leans head against bureau.


JUDE

Don't move!


Jude snaps picture. FLASH!


CUT TO:


INT. KARIN'S BATHROOM - DAY -FLASHBACK-


TIMECUT. "Seventy-six Trombones" plays as Karin poses over 

toilet. She twists head, drops jaw, stares vacantly. Jude 

moves erratically, testing camera angles, speaking as if 

spellbound:


JUDE

...She was a SAS stewardess. Having 

an affair with two different pilots -- 

both at 37,000 feet! We found her in 

the ladies room at JFK, choked, just 

like that. A real beauty. Hold it.


Mazzo snaps another pic -- FLASH! -- pulls Karin to feet:


JUDE

Who do you want to do now?


KARIN

The rock and roll singer! Julie!


JUDE

Right.


* SCREENWRITER'S NOTE: The choice of pop source music (with 

the exception of "Chantilly Lace") is indicative, not 

proscriptive. Jude is the product of rock and roll, more 

Presley than politics. Source music should also provide ironic 

counterpoint to action, reinforcing symbolic drama -- keeping 

viewer at arm's length. Alternative titles, equally effective, 

spring to mind: "Changes" by David Bowie, "Hanky Panky" by 

Tommy James and the Shondells, "Man Machine" by Kraftwerk, 

"Imagine" by John Lennon, etc.


CUT TO:


INT. KARIN'S BEDROOM - DAY -FLASHBACK-


TIMECUT. Karin, mini-skirted, hangs half-naked over bed. 

Joan Jett sings "I Love Rock and Roll." Jude narrates 

scenario:


JUDE

...she's found in a cheap motel 

outside Crisfield. Her tongue ripped 

out, body covered with record albums 

and tapes -- all sacred music...


Mazzo yanks albums from shelves, places them on Karin as she 

hums mantra "om."


JUDE

...her boyfriend was a religious 

fanatic, divinity school dropout --


KARIN

(objects)

No, he was an artist --


JUDE

-- we found him two blocks away in a 

local bar, listening to her beautiful 

voice coming from the jukebox like 

an angel's.


He snaps again. FLASH! Karin returns to life:


KARIN

The revolutionary!


CUT TO:


INT. KARIN'S LIVING ROOM - DAY -FLASHBACK-


TIMECUT. Jude places Karin, wearing grey skirt and black 

bra, on chaise as Village People repeat, "I'm a macho, macho 

man..." Mazzo bounds about, ecstatic. Karin howls with 

laughter.


They grow frenetic with each enactment. Their psyches meld 

for a moment: is it sex or is it symbiosis? Jude circles:


JUDE

A young coed. University of Maryland. 

Murdered by her sociology professor, 

suffocated by $100 bills. Then raped 

after she was dead...


Mazzo stuffs Kleenex in Karin's mouth, spreads her knees:


JUDE

...Spread your legs. Now don't move.


Click. FLASH! Karin removes tissues from mouth:


KARIN

But don't you get excited when they're 

found like this?


JUDE

I was very excited by a case several 

years ago.

(kneels beside her)

He had a device...

(voice trails off)


KARIN

Tell me about it.


JUDE

(embarrassed)

No, no, I can't.


Technician #2'S VOICE returns us to present:


TECHNICIAN #2 (V.O.)

Obviously the work of an amateur.


END OF FLASHBACK


CUT TO:


INT. KARIN'S KITCHEN - NIGHT


U.S. Attorney Mazzo turns from "crime scene" photos, walks 

over bloody footprints (now covered with plastic). Gideon 

joins him from bedroom:


DECT. GIDEON

He must have been an idiot.


JUDE

Who?


DECT. GIDEON

The killer.


JUDE

Why is he an idiot?


DECT. GIDEON

Because of the way he acted. Stupidly 

and arrogantly. He empties her jewelry 

box but dosen't take the money. He 

kills her, then marches into the 

john to shower. Puts shoes on, leaves 

footprints across kitchen. Just 

stupid.


JUDE

According to you.


Mazzo and Gideon stare eye to eye; their rivalry rises to 

surface. Gideon bites lip, represses resentment. "Just wait," 

Gideon's eyeballs say, "I too will have my day."


Jude puts his arm around Detective Gideon:


JUDE

You know I have put together a task 

force for NATA, the new antiterror 

agency, Gid, and I was thinking I 

might have something that would 

interest you.


Gideon's honored but wary. He quickly calculates pros and 

cons:


DECT. GIDEON

God knows I'm flattered. Honest, 

Jude. I'm just not sure I could work 

for you --


JUDE

Name a position.


DECT. GIDEON

(shakes head)

I'm willing to be swallowed but not 

digested. I don't want to end up in 

the rectum.


JUDE

I respect that. I can respect dumb.


Mazzo walks back toward bedroom.


CUT TO:


INT. KARIN'S BEDROOM - NIGHT


Jude watches as Paramedics lower Karin's body onto stretcher, 

looks to Milton and Weiss:


JUDE

I really wish it were the husband, 

too. It would be easier.


CUT TO:


INT. LOBBY - NIGHT


Hawaiian silkscreens now top lit, hang on wall. Mazzo and 

Milton cross as cops screen incoming residents. Ahead, TV 

lights glare blindingly through front doors.


CUT TO:


EXT. KARIN'S APT. BLDG. - NIGHT


Reporters yell questions as Jude/Milton squeeze through press 

gauntlet without comment. Mazzo turns to favor "Eyewitness 

News" crew, recognizes dim profile in crowd: Ria Maled. Jude 

quickly continues; Milt follows.


Mazzo subtly motions to SAM ZEGNER, 23, peach-fuzzed "print 

journalist," as he and Avery approach Beretta. Jude points 

to pay phone, dials in pantomine. Sam responds with nod as 

Mazzo and Milton enter car, drive away.


Sam scurries to phone booth, inserts coin, punches dial 

buttons: the Jimmy Olson illusion vanishes -- just another 

headline whore.


CUT TO:


INT. BERETTA - NIGHT


Carphone RINGS. Jude picks up receiver as they drive south 

through Georgetown. Sam speaks from M Street phone booth, 

sometimes OFF SCREEN, sometimes ON SCREEN:


SAM

Rumor says we got a scandal. Great 

going away present, huh, Attorney? 

Or should I call you Director? 

Congratulations by the way. So? So?


JUDE

It's still "Mr. Attorney" and no 

comment, Sam.


SAM

Jude, please. I've got a lot of dirty 

minds to feed.


JUDE

Just this -- but it didn't come from 

me...


SAM

Of course not -- I'm not even on the 

phone.


JUDE

The place reeked of sex. You can't 

imagine. Unnatural acts. Really 

disgusting -- and one other thing. 

We didn't find any underwear in the 

apartment. None. Not anywhere.


SAM

Sex crime?


JUDE

No, she just didn't wear any. Your 

readers oughtta like that.


SAM

Great, I'll lead with it. Any names 

involved? Diplomatic corps, I bet. 

Right? Why else would you be there? 

Must be big --


JUDE

False alarm, nothing there. The Bureau 

and D.C.P.D. will investigate -- if 

they can stop pissin on each other.

(a beat)

Go for the crime-of-passion, Sam. 

Lead with the domestic angle, follow 

with the kink. Play up the husband. 

He's the key. Trust me. Do this for 

me, okay?


SAM

Great, thanks.

(Jude hangs up)


Mazzo doesn't bother with goodbyes. Conversation terminated. 

Never transpired.


Georgetown U. shops and bars pass right and left. Milton 

hasn't spoken for some time. Jude turns to him:


JUDE

I want you to keep me informed on 

this Schreiber case, Milt. Keep on 

it.


MILTON

From the Justice Department? I don't 

even know what my job will be after 

you leave. I may not have access. I 

may not have a desk.


JUDE

What do you mean, Justice Department?

(a beat)

Didn't I tell you?


MILTON

(confused)

What?


JUDE

Do you think I'd let someone as good 

as you slip through my hands? You're 

coming with me to NATA -- as first 

or second assistant, unless something 

else, of course. I told you weeks 

ago.


Avery's palpably relieved. His fear of being left behind had 

become an obsession. He would have, of course, remembered an 

earlier offer -- that's for sure! -- no matter now.


MILTON

I remember now...


JUDE

Maybe I wasn't clear.


MILTON

I appreciate the faith you have in 

me. I won't let you down.


CUT TO:


EXT. WASHINGTON HARBOUR - NIGHT


Later that night. Beretta drives under Whitehurst Freeway, 

turns in sprawling commercial/residential complex -- the 

"Washington Harbour" development, completion date 1987, 

Postmodern equivalent of Watergate Office Building: just as 

ugly, twice as trendy. On the Potomac, south of Georgetown, 

Washington Harbour boasts Cuisinart mix of arches, ariels, 

bays and balconies -- a yuppie Watts Towers.


Jude parks in assigned space, enters door flanked by 

ornamental columns. Lawn lights exaggerate structure's fairy 

tale architecture.


CUT TO:


INT. 1ST FLOOR HALL - NIGHT


He passes mirror of trompe l'oeil wallpaper, waits for 

elevator, steps in as doors close.


CUT TO:


INT. 2ND FLOOR HALL - NIGHT


Jude rounds corner, approaches through corridor of "Etruscan" 

murals. Each floor has distinct decor -- each a tier of 

tackiness.


Mazzo withdraws keys, unlocks apartment door.


CUT TO:


INT. JUDE'S LIVING ROOM - NIGHT


Jude strides across rectangle room overlooking Potomac. 

Arlington County glistens out the window. Furniture and found 

objects sit at odd angles; behind, a Shaker pew is stacked 

with file cartons. "Superman" pinball machine stands behind.


Brian Ferry croons "The Stroll" from vintage Rockola jukebox; 

Jude's footsteps echo Ferry's beat. He loosens his tie.


CUT TO:


INT. JUDE'S OFFICE - NIGHT


Jude closes door, sits at custom-made desk -- crescent slab 

of green marble atop Mission Style base. Faded "Washington 

Senators" pennant hangs between celebrity photos. Bookshelves 

blanket the adjoining walls. CNN plays silently on desktop 

TV.


Jude removes Karin's purloined necklace, unwraps it. After 

brief glimpse, he rewraps necklace in handkerchief, locks it 

in desk drawer.


Mazzo stares at black phone. It RINGS OFF SCREEN.


CUT TO:


INT. JUDE'S BEDROOM - NIGHT


Mazzo rolls around sheets, unable to sleep. OFF SCREEN 

telephone RINGS. Karin speaks in flashback:


KARIN (V.O.)

Mr. Attorney? You don't know me. How 

could you? We never met. Think I go 

around with cops?...


INT. KARIN'S BEDROOM - DAY -FLASHBACK-


Eighteen months before. Karin, wearing brown negligee, sits 

on bed, speaks on phone. Poising finger over disconnect 

button, she laughs into receiver. Dialogue continuous from 

previous scene:


KARIN

(Taunting)

...Who am I? Maybe I'm a terrorist. 

One of the two thousand terrorists 

running free you talk so much about. 

Bet you think you're sexy in those 

discount suits that bulge up the 

crotch?

(a beat)

What's my name?

(laughs)

Why don't you find out? You're so 

smart. Always giving interviews, 

being photographed -- speaking of 

which, you should lose some weight.

(hangs up)


CUT TO:


INT. KARIN'S BEDROOM - DAY -FLASHBACK-


Similar day. Karin, half in negligee, stretches through sheets 

as she speaks to Jude, insinuating phone sex like sorority 

cockteaser.


KARIN

...Mr. United States Attorney. Such 

a man. Can't even find a horny 

terrorist sympathizer. Can't even 

find an obscene caller, the most 

obvious thing in the world, an obscene 

caller, naked, lying here, feeling 

herself, thinking about Mr. U.S. 

Attorney thinking about me in his 

ugly black shoes all cops wear, with 

Vibram soles...


CUT TO:


INT. KARIN'S BEDROOM - DAY -FLASHBACK-


Similar day. Karin, in open robe, bolts upright in bed. Her 

phone montage continues:


KARIN

(faking fear)

...Oh, help me, help me! Mr. Attorney, 

someone is breaking into my apartment. 

He's crazy. I think he's tapping my 

phone. He's trying to get me! He 

wants to rape me!

(looks up)

He's here now! And he has no pants 

on!

(falls back)

I'm all alone with the man who will 

rape me. That's my destiny. I need 

you...


CUT TO:


INT. KARIN'S BATHROOM - DAY -FLASHBACK-


Similar day. Karin, on phone, smoking cigarette, soaks in 

steamy tub. Bath water reveals her body.


KARIN

...always in black -- did somebody 

die on you?

(a beat)

Don't kid yourself. You don't appeal 

to me. You're just a typical little 

man with a typical belly, a 

bureaucrat. I imagine you must sweat 

and wear cheap musk aftershave -- 

certainly not my favorite...


CUT TO:


INT. KARIN'S BEDROOM - EVENING -FLASHBACK-


Similar day. Last sun glows through translucent window shades. 

Karin, nude but for lace shawl, leans cross-legged on bed. 

Brown phone rests strategically atop her crotch. Black cord 

runs between her thighs, across her breasts. Karin steadies 

base with one hand, fingers cord with other as she continues 

in medias res:


KARIN

...a D.A. must know a million secrets, 

just like a priest. Actually it's 

your mind I like. I admire all police. 

I'd love to be a stoolie. If you 

gave me the third degree I would do 

anything.

(listens: flares)

Do that with your mother 'cause she's 

used to it!


On screen, old building burns inaudibly -- it could be a 

news report, it could be a movie.


SOUND: front door opening. Squeaky FOOTSTEPS. She flips off 

tube, twists head:


KARIN

Who is it?


Door latches shut. Black shoes enter screen left. With Vibram 

soles. Jude steps in, speaking on wireless phone. He has 

been conversing en route.


JUDE

Police.


Mazzo, sweaty, Nixon-eyed, enters in ill-fit black suit, 

white shirt, wrinkled tie. Matted clump of hair hangs on 

forehead. Stomach paunch stretches shirt. No cool Jude, this.


He crosses living area, stands in boudoir. Karin slams 

receiver down, makes no attempt to cover herself:


KARIN

It's you, Mr. Attorney. I thought it 

was either the police or a junkie.


Jude rests receiver on table, suspiciously sniffs hand-rolled 

cigarette, replaces butt in ashtray. Karin rolls over, 

wrapping bod in bed sheets. Mazzo circles:


JUDE

What do you want from me?


KARIN

Just a little fun.


JUDE

Why didn't you call the Vice 

Department?


KARIN

(insulted)

What kind of girl do you think I am?


Jude withdraws a stapled stack of phone bills from vest 

pocket, displays them:


JUDE

Your phone calls this year. You know 

these people? 244-4832? Huh?


KARIN

They're friends.


JUDE

They're terrorists -- suspected 

terrorists, or sympathizers.


KARIN

I don't care about politics.


JUDE

They're criminals. Murderers.


Karin leans back.


JUDE

Did you really think you were going 

to get away with it?


She shifts onto side, revealing bare breast, aroused aureola, 

nipple. Soothing strip of naked skin runs length of Karin's 

body, over hill, over dale. She turns to Jude with o-so brutal 

bedroom eyes:


KARIN

What are you going to do with me now 

that you found me, Mr. Attorney? 

Torture me? Just a little?


END OF FLASHBACK


CUT TO:


INT. JUSTICE DEPT. RECEPTION HALL - DAY


TV lights harshly illuminate the Grand Reception Hall: a 

press conference is underway. Deco room is dominated by WPA 

aluminum statues, one on either side of stage. Semi-nude 12-

foot figures, male and female, symbolize "The Spirit of 

Justice" (female) and "The Majesty of the Law" (male).


On stage, Jude Mazzo stands out in a line of look-alike 

bureaucrats. The more inconspicuous he tries to appear, the 

more conspicuous he is. He's the star here and knows it.


Press listens patiently as ATTORNEY GENERAL WILLIAM GABRIEL 

reads prepared remarks. Gabriel, 60, bald, counter-points 

jutting jaw with sympathetic expression. ASSISTANT A.G., 

40ish, button-down career type, stands beside him.


ATTORNEY GENERAL

Just as the early years of this 

century demanded a new law enforcement 

bureau, the FBI, so these difficult 

times require a new, independent 

antiterrorist agency, NATA, which 

will coordinate efforts of the Justice 

and State Departments, Army, Navy, 

Air Force, Marine Corps, FBI, CIA, 

NSC and agencies of friendly 

governments...


TIMECUT. Jude, at podium, concludes statement with "Thank 

you."


Press jumps to life. Questions fly. Here's a man to their 

liking. Here's a man who can sell newspapers.


Jude is at ease, confident. He mixes sincerity with affability -- 

the mark of a political star. We hear, in JUMP CUTS, his 

answers:


JUDE

There may be some inter-agency 

friction at first -- even "rivalry" 

as you suggest. NATA isn't the 

problem, it's the answer.

(jump cut)

My father was a proud man, not wealthy 

but proud. It hurt him so much to 

hear and read the things people said 

about Italian-Americans. He wanted 

his son to be a lawyer so others 

wouldn't think we were gangsters, so 

others would know we loved America 

too.

(jump cut)

My "high profile"? I'm glad you asked 

that -- again. I've always felt law 

enforcement is meant to be high 

profile. The United States shouldn't 

hide from terrorists -- they don't 

respect cowardice or vacillation. 

Terrorists know who I am and where 

to find me. If you want to call that 

high profile -- well, go ahead. I 

have no desire to be high profile 

for myself. My goal is to become 

unknown. The better I do my job the 

sooner I'll be unknown. In five years 

I plan to be a trivia question.


Reporters laugh. Others, younger, watch enrapted.


CUT TO:


EXT. NATA HEADQUARTERS - DAY


West Washington is Capitol's current architectural showcase. 

Post-modern structures stand shoulder to shoulder along M 

Street from 24th to 22nd. Similar buildings -- replete with 

arches and domes -- dot surrounding streets.


NATA headquarters occupies three-story townhouse near 24th 

and M. Its facade has been restyled to match neighborhood. 

No identifying sign or plaque. Only a concrete curbside 

barrier indicates nature of building. Uniformed officer in 

doorway.


CUT TO:


INT. NATA CORRIDOR - DAY


Inside, townhouse is maze of renovation. Building has been 

gutted and redesigned, custom-fitted with latest law 

enforcement technology.


Workmen paint unfinished trim as Director Mazzo leads phalanx 

of subordinates down corridor. The new staffers, young, 

unflapable, radiate self-confidence. Jude has chosen the 

best and brightest. Milton and Alan, Executive Assistant 

from scene 17, follow him.


They wear laminated identification tags around necks. All 

federal employees and visitors must display color-coded tags 

indicating their department and security status. Jude, Milt 

and Alan pass through metal detector as guard glances at 

their tags.


Additional staffers stand outside conference room as Jude 

and others enter, exchange greetings.


CUT TO:


INT. NATA CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY


Assigned representatives from various law enforcement agencies 

sit at lined rows of tables. Name cards identify each: State 

Dept, Defense Dept, Joint Chiefs, FBI, IG/T, NSC, various 

state and local police. NATA staffers occupy chairs behind 

them.


Vacant folding table faces the others. NATA seal hangs behind 

table. Room is quiet, as if gossip were a security breach.


Then, suddenly, Jude strides through, laughing and talking. 

Everyone rises. Jude calls out:


JUDE

Sit down, please! And loosen up! It 

feels like goddamn Bulgaria in here.


They chuckle, comply. Jude takes a beat, says as he sits:


JUDE

Just remember to loosen up real tight.


Laughter. Mazzo unfolds prepared remarks as he surveys room. 

He's seen from many points of view, some quick, some in 

motion:


JUDE

I wanted to bring all the agencies 

and departments together if only for 

this first meeting. We're all now 

part of NATA.

(speaks from notes)

I'm not a politician but I've been 

put in charge of a political agency. 

That's different from my old job of 

prosecuting criminals. Isn't it 

significant to you that this 

administration choose a man like me 

at a time like this to direct so 

sensitive an agency? Consider the 

reasons they singled me out. Let's 

glance at criminal acts and political 

acts. The simple basic truth is there 

is no distinction at all today -- 

they're alike, the activist and the 

criminal.

(passionate)

Here's a rule and you better start 

to memorize it! In every criminal 

there is a subversive and in every 

subversive there is a criminal! No 

wonder we find terrorists so often 

involved in crimes like kidnapping 

and robbery. The difference between 

those who rob banks and those 

spreading terror is too small to be 

taken into account. They have the 

same objective, the criminal and the 

terrorist, even though they use 

different means: they want to overturn 

our present social order, our way of 

life! The Law shall prevail against 

upheaval. The Law is permanent and 

timeless, like sculpture, like a 

temple. They call this "The Age of 

Terrorism" -- and it's easy to see 

why. Governments cower as their 

leaders wheel and deal with criminals. 

Nations are held hostage by thugs 

and vandals. Cowardice is called 

diplomacy. The Law is mocked. Justice 

walks the streets like a whore. And 

what do we do? We defenders of the 

Law? We watch in disarray, play 

politics, blame each other.

(emphatic)

No more. Remember this day. It marks 

the end of the Age of Terrorism. The 

Law will be redeemed!

(stands)

The Law is the answer! America is 

back!


Others burst into spontaneous applause as they rise.


CUT TO:


INT. NATA COMPUTER CENTER - DAY


Mazzo and VICTOR, 30, NATA archivist, enter micro-chip brain 

bank center. They pass high-tech cubicles, each with computer 

terminal. The room's almost ready. A few employees are already 

on the job. Across room, electricians rewire switch box.


All rows lead to "supercomputer" with four bug-eye screens. 

They approach as COMPUTER TECHNICIAN programs console. Victor, 

all business, speaks with deceptive drawl:


VICTOR

Each terminal feeds into the super-

computer, we call it "Big Moma," 

which connects to NCIC at FBI and 

select access at Langley. NCIC alone 

can handle 400,000 requests a day. 

Cross-filed information on every 

organization in the world. Every 

felon, every taxpayer. Every time 

anybody ever plugged into the system -- 

it's all here. Completely legal, too -- 

with memory hide just in case.


Technician steps away as Jude examines supercomputer:


JUDE

How is it cross-filed?


VICTOR

For the core group we index 

everything: political hist, psych 

pro, explosives, sex, money, travel, 

friends, hairstyle -- you name it. I 

can give you a list of all known 

radicals with bowel problems. You'd 

be surprised how many there are.


JUDE

They say information is power.


VICTOR

Then you've got a lot of it.


JUDE

This is the real revolution, eh? Can 

I give this thing a whirl?


VICTOR

It's a little tricky, Director.


Vic sits, activates quad screens:


VICTOR

What's your pleasure?


JUDE

(pacing)

Let's try the Schreiber case. First 

name Karin. Born 7-22-63. Murder. 

Motive was political. M Street--


VICTOR

(punching keyboard)

Address?


JUDE

2085. Apartment 5C.


Victor enters data at wiz kid speed. Lower monitor flashes 

with facts.


VICTOR

Let's start there. Known political 

contacts. Occupant history of 

building.


Jude watches as info fills second screen:


JUDE

Any luck?


VICTOR

Who is this girl? Looks like she 

banged every Red group in Europe -- 

plus a couple I never heard of. You 

want this on screen or should I print 

it out?


JUDE

Print it out.


Victor flicks switch. Mazzo reads from printer as it rat-tat-

tats toilet roll of data re Schreiber.


VICTOR

There's probably some fabrication. 

Realized she was under surveillance. 

God knows how much time we spend 

filing disinformation. Okay, here we 

go. Schreiber contact, anarchist, 

now resident 2085 M Street.


JUDE

Were they lovers?


VICTOR

Not here.


JUDE

Let's see him.


VICTOR

No color.


JUDE

Black and white's fine.


Vic reads screen aloud as picture rises from photofax. 

Enlarged snapshot shows young Ria Maled amid protesters, his 

face circled.


VICTOR

Born Torino, 9-11-64. Most this from 

Interpol. Red Brigades. Four arrests 

in Italy, one Germany. No convictions. 

Been quiet last couple years.


Jude rips photo fresh from machine. CLOSE-UP of Ria.


JUDE

Do we have a tap on his phone?


VICTOR

(checks)

Since 1985.


Mazzo scrunches up his face with hand:


JUDE

Look at that face! A real killer's 

face! I'll see to it the bastard 

gets put away.


CUT TO:


EXT. JUSTICE DEPT. - DAY


Out-of-context legend "Framed Through Mutual Confidence"

A mural tribute to the common man surrounds deco entrance: 

"Office of the Attorney General." A cleric passes. VOICES

CUT TO:


INT. ATTORNEY GENERAL'S OFFICE - DAY


Attorney General Gabriel warmly greets Jude at his desk. WPA 

decor is discretely carried over into office.


Assistant A.G. stands beside bookshelves. Gabriel dismisses 

him with flick of eye. Assistant exits with lacky alacrity.


ATTORNEY GENERAL

So, Jude? Satisfied?


Mazzo sits straight in Eileen Gray chair. Jude's tone varies, 

at times impassioned, other times hurt, coy, ingratiating -- 

but always calculated:


JUDE

Fine. Though sometimes I think I'm 

being set up, you know, the scapegoat 

for all this inter-agency feuding. I 

wouldn't want a scandal. I know the 

President views this seriously --


ATTORNEY GENERAL

(wisecracks)

The President views movies seriously.


JUDE

What I really need is a great many 

more permanent members at my disposal -- 

perhaps a hundred. The country is 

frightened. And more funding so we 

could pay our informers better.


Gabriel paces, examines object d'art, returns to seat:


ATTORNEY GENERAL

I'll bring it up.


JUDE

And what I would like, really like...

(hesitates)


ATTORNEY GENERAL

Go on.


JUDE

...really like maybe three apartments 

in various capitals, in quiet 

neighborhoods, practical, my 

informants could be there and 

establish the kind of relationship 

that is more... confidential than it 

is now. Terrorists have state 

sponsors, more resources --


ATTORNEY GENERAL

It's not that bad. You act like they 

blew up your office.


JUDE

I'd rather act than react, sir.


ATTORNEY GENERAL

(stung)

You can have your apartments. But, 

officially, my office must know 

nothing.


JUDE

My staff has prepared a list of 

another 200 suspicious persons and 

taps must really go on their phones. 

Now I don't know how the Department 

okays this. Must I make an official 

request or what?


ATTORNEY GENERAL

Taken care of.

(looks up)

Anything else?


JUDE

Oh yes, there's that extraordinary 

killer they're trying to find.


ATTORNEY GENERAL

The Schreiber case.


JUDE

Mrs. Karin Schreiber.


ATTORNEY GENERAL

Beautiful woman. I've seen her 

photograph.


JUDE

(sheepish)

Well, I, ah, used to know her. In 

fact she and I had... a little... 

affair.


Gabriel smiles, impressed:


ATTORNEY GENERAL

Not bad.

(lascivious)

How was she? Good?


JUDE

(awkward)

Well... not bad...

(hesitates)

Well, I wanted to know if I should 

inform the agents who are on it. I 

don't know, I really don't.


Gabriel stands without comment, terminates meeting:


ATTORNEY GENERAL

(pleasant)

Good day.


JUDE

Is that all?


Attorney Gabriel escorts Mazzo to door like proud father:


ATTORNEY GENERAL

That's it.

(shakes Jude's hand)

They're all watching you, Jude. You've 

made quite an impression. You've got 

the press like this:

(cups hand)

There's one thing I don't understand. 

Why do you think people like you so?


Jude answers without hesitation, as if stating a simple fact:


JUDE

(ingenuous)

I make 'em feel good.


Gabriel nods, walks toward desk, turning to Jude as Mazzo 

exits:


ATTORNEY GENERAL

The husband. It must be him.


CUT TO:


INT. JUDE'S JUSTICE DEPT. OFFICE - DAY


Lt. Weiss watches as Mazzo packs memorabilia in Bekins box: 

ceremonial paperweight, photos, etc. His office is half-empty, 

stripped of non-institutional furnishings. Jude's moving to 

NATA.


LT. WEISS

Sure I can't help, Director?


JUDE

Almost done. First rule of public 

service: pack quick. I'll be at NATA 

tomorrow. You started to brief me on 

the Schreiber case -- I hate to see 

my last case unsolved. It's like 

leaving dirty laundry -- Milt shoulda 

been here by now.


LT. WEISS

You know there's this jurisdictional 

thing between us and FBI. Day to 

day, D.C. gets nothing from the 

Bureau. But come a sexy case and 

they're all over us, pulling rank, 

taking credit. I'm sick of it.


JUDE

Too bad you couldn't come with me to 

NATA.


LT. WEISS

Huh?


JUDE

I wanted you.


LT. WEISS

You know I --


JUDE

It was just that damn N.C. urine 

test. Winston-Salem, 1979, with minute 

traces of you-know-what -- and it's 

not just me who knows.


LT. WEISS

(panic)

It was a college thing, honest. They 

said it was off the books. I know it 

was --


JUDE

Don't worry. It's under control. 

I'll just bring you in later.


LT. WEISS

Believe me --


JUDE

I do. Don't apologize.

(looks up)

Here's Milton.

(to Milt)

Where were you? Lt. Weiss was bringing 

me up to date on Schreiber.


MILTON

(nods to Weiss)

I've already heard.


Lt. Weiss recites report:


LT. WEISS

Looks like you were right on the 

husband. We tracked him, then Gideon 

pulled rank, took him to FBI. I hear 

he's babbling like a brook. Guess 

what? The lab crew turned up a pale 

blue thread from under the victim's 

fingernail. A single strand. It must 

come from the killer's tie.


JUDE

His tie?


MILTON

Yeah, his tie.


JUDE

(scornful)

First you told me the killer was 

nude, in the sex act, now he's humping 

nude with a blue tie on -- right?


Weiss and Milton, chagrined, exchange exculpatory glances.


LT. WEISS

We're waiting for the thread analysis. 

And there are the fingerprints, of 

course. They're at FBI too. There's 

nothing solid there. Only yours.


JUDE

Only mine!

These are Director Mazzo's.


Lt. Weiss leans to examine slides:


LT. WEISS

Here's the shower faucet -- you turned 

it on. The refrigerator handle. 

Several from a drinking glass.


MILTON

(unctuous)

You had a drink of water, remember, 

Director? You weren't feeling well.


Dect. Gideon watches as Weiss and Milton vie to rationalize 

Jude's fingerprints.


LT. WEISS

(describing slide)

The telephone --


MILTON

You made a call. I saw you.


LT. WEISS

The tape deck. You played that.

(to Gideon)

What about the thread? From the tie?


Gideon takes moment to answer:


DECT. GIDEON

At Fiber Analysis. They say it may 

be unique, even traceable -- a long 

shot. Sky blue, silk --

(to Jude)

I seem to remember you were wearing 

a tie like that the day of the murder. 

A coincidence, but do you remember 

by any chance where you bought it?


Gideon stares at Jude: his tone's innocent but his eyes are 

ice. Milton shifts uncomfortably; Weiss coughs. Jude, 

oblivious, wrinkles brow:


JUDE

Boy, I can't..., I'll have to check 

the label...


MILTON

It's all moot anyway. The husband's 

gonna confess. I hear it's just a 

matter of time. Just like you thought, 

a crime of passion.


LT. WEISS

(to Gideon)

What a disappointment for the FBI.


DECT. GIDEON

(to Weiss)

A tribute to superior police work.


JUDE

Where is he?


CUT TO:


INT. FBI CORRIDOR - AFTERNOON


Interrogation is heard OFF SCREEN as Jude walks through 

concrete passageway, turns corner. Gideon, Milton and Weiss 

follow.


CUT TO:


INT. OBSERVATION ROOM/INTERROGATION ROOM - AFTERNOON


Mazzo enters tiny OBSERVATION ROOM, stands before one-way 

mirror. FBI TYPES step back as Milt and Weiss squeeze behind 

Jude.


Framed in Interrogation Room mirror, TWO FBI INTERROGATORS 

grill GEORGES SCHREIBER, 42, Karin's ex-husband -- survivor 

of three revolutions: sexual, political, drug. He lost all 

three.


Gideon bypasses Observation Room, enters INTERROGATION ROOM 

where Georges sits slumped in lone chair. Jude and others 

watch through mirror as Interrogators harrangue Georges:


FBI INTERROGATOR #1

Why didn't you divorce your wife?


FBI INTERROGATOR #2

Let's be blunt. Why mince words? 

Weren't you a practicing homosexual 

at the time you separated from Mrs. 

Schreiber?


FBI INTERROGATOR #1

You faggot!


FBI INTERROGATOR #2

Didn't she catch you taking her money 

to buy little boys on P Street?


Interrogators nod to Gideon as he joins them. Georges 

protests:


GEORGES

It wasn't like that. Don't put it 

like that. I loved her. I really 

did.


FBI INTERROGATOR #1

(circling)

Is that so?


DECT. GIDEON

Make up your mind. You might as well. 

We know everything about you.


Inside OBSERVATION ROOM, Weiss and others watch interrogation 

like it's a play. Milton whispers to Jude:


MILTON

He's trying to get sympathy. He won't 

last long.


BACK IN INTERROGATION ROOM:


DECT. GIDEON

Okay, Georges, you're an artist, a 

decorator, a sensitive person. We'll 

try to help you. Just tell us the 

whole story. Slowly, calmly. Start 

with the morning your wife Karin was 

killed.


GEORGES

I already told you.


DECT. GIDEON

Tell us again.


GEORGES

I had picked up my car. I was back 

on the Beltway. You couldn't get 

where you were going. Traffic was 

backed up, at a standstill --


In OBSERVATION ROOM, man comments:


FBI TYPE

That's the truth.


In INTERROGATION ROOM, Georges continues:


GEORGES

-- millions of cars. Everyone honking 

their horns.


Interrogator #1 snorts with disgust; #2 chuckles: Georges 

plaintively pans from one to other.


GEORGES

I'm answering everything you ask. 

I'm telling you everything Honest.


DECT. GIDEON

(tough)

Hah! Not quite everything. No, you 

haven't talked at all about 

everything.

(grabs Georges' hair)

For example, you haven't talked about 

how you used your wife to push your 

career until she refused. You didn't 

tell us that, a friend of yours told 

us...


OBSERVATION ROOM. Mazzo watches as Karin introduces flashback:


KARIN (V.O.)

I've got a way to wake you up...


CUT TO:


INT. KARIN'S BEDROOM - DAY -FLASHBACK-


Nine months before. Jude, wearing white dress shirt and jockey 

shorts, snores face-up on sheets. Karin, in negligee, bends 

over him, shakes Jude's shoulders.


KARIN

...Third degree me. Get up, do 

something. Don't sleep.


JUDE

Leave me alone.


KARIN

Com'on, I like it when you question 

me. You're so suspicious of me -- it 

reminds me of my father. Com'on, 

third degree me. Interrogate me.


Mazzo bolts up as Karin pushes something under his nose. He 

stands, yanks her off bed:


JUDE

Alright, first get off the bed. Off 

the bed! Now get down on your knees!

(pushes her to floor)

Straighten up! Straight!


Jude steps to bureau, lights cigarette, sits with detached 

cool of experienced interrogator. Karin giggles:


KARIN

The silent treatment, right? That 

comes first to scare them.


JUDE

Straighten up.


She does. Mazzo walks over, circles her closely, looking 

askance like a Caesar:


JUDE

Now imagine the terrible hours ahead 

of you. The cruel questions, the 

constant tricks, the threats. 

Everything. Try to recall the most 

shameful, the dirtiest things you 

ever did. Think about the fact that 

I will discover all these secrets 

because the government offers me the 

means to strip you down to anything 

I want.

(slaps her)

Straighten up! You begin to think of 

all the hidden sins you've committed. 

Your quilt complex takes over.


KARIN

(girlish)

That's not frightening. Third degree 

me. Be my terrorist.


Jude cradles her face in his hands:


JUDE

You want me to interrogate you? To 

frighten you?


Karin nods grinning. He sharply twists her ear; she howls.


JUDE

Talk, talk! Tell me your most shameful 

secrets. Confess everything, the 

little sins you commit everyday. 

Then I'll forgive you and protect 

you.


KARIN

(excited)

You treat them like babies.


JUDE

Everyone becomes a child again when 

confronted by official authority. By 

the power that belongs to the police.

(slaps her)

Sit up straight!

(slaps her again)

Listen. Don't move. The Law. All 

laws, conscious and unconscious laws, 

make the accused become like a child.

(demented)

The accuser becomes the father, the 

perfect father that cannot be 

attacked, that must be pleased at 

any price!

(contorts expression)

My face starts to be God's face to 

you! It's a game staged to touch off 

your deepest fears.


Mazzo glances at Karin's now anxious face. He picks bouquet 

of dried flowers from wastebasket, speaks in soothing tones:


JUDE

Hey, don't look so worried.

(sits alongside)

I'm trying to explain this whole 

mentality because you can't see that 

it's the basis, the whole foundation 

of official authority. Professors, 

doctors, heads of political parties, 

even ticket takers.


KARIN

You're much more like a child than 

any father, believe me, you're --


Jude muzzles Karin with dead bouquet mid-sentence, pushes 

her prone to floor:


JUDE

You shouldn't have said that. The 

others are children. Here...


Jude arranges flowers around her face, says playfully:


JUDE

...Now I'll show you how we found 

that whore in the medical office!


END OF FLASHBACK


CUT TO:


INT. INTERROGATION ROOM - AFTERNOON


Five sweaty Interrogators surround Georges. INTERROGATOR #3, 

apprentice addition, wipes foggy glasses on sleeve. Georges 

Schreiber, dehydrated, maintains innocence:


GEORGES

-- I just told you --


FBI INTERROGATOR #2

(hostile)

When you gonna give up that phoney 

traffic jam story?


FBI INTERROGATOR #1

Fag bullshit.


GEORGES

Please, I told you...


Interrogation's getting nowhere. Gideon backs FBI boys off:


DECT. GIDEON

Okay, okay, wait, wait. Let's leave 

Mr. Schreiber alone for awhile. All 

by yourself. That way you can decide 

what you should do. What the truth 

is. The rest of you, step out with 

me.


Interrogators leave with Gideon.


CUT TO:


INT. INTERROGATION CORRIDOR - AFTERNOON


Jude exits Observation Room, joins as Gideon calms 

Interrogators:


DECT. GIDEON

It's alright, take a break...


JUDE

(to Gideon)

You yell so loud. Why do you guys 

yell so loud?


DECT. GIDEON

(frustrated)

I yell so loud because I learned 

from you. Okay?


Mazzo doesn't answer, walks into Interrogation Room. Gideon 

waits till Jude's gone:


DECT. GIDEON

Why doesn't he mind his own business? 

He's got his own agency now.


FBI INTERROGATOR #1

He likes to interfere.


DECT. GIDEON

Let him try.


CUT TO:


INT. INTERROGATION ROOM - AFTERNOON


Georges, hunched over, turns as Jude squats beside chair. 

Mazzo offers cigarette:


JUDE

A cliché -- take it anyway.

(Georges does)

You decorated Ambassador Arburg's 

house, right? In Arlington?


Georges acknowledges as Jude lights trembling cigarette.


JUDE

I thought so. All modern -- in a 

contemporary way.

(Georges flattered)

Mr. Schreiber, when was the last 

time you saw your wife?


GEORGES

Two weeks prior to the murder. But I 

was in touch cause I was being 

threatened. This man. Somebody who 

called.


JUDE

Who was he?


GEORGES

I don't know. Anonymous phone calls. 

He called me late once, twice. He 

had the tone of someone who commands 

others.


JUDE

Why did they do it?


GEORGES

They had fun making me suffer. 

Humiliating me. I'm so confused. 

Maybe I did kill her.


JUDE

What did he threaten you with? This 

unknown caller?


GEORGES

He would say to me, "I'm gonna tell 

the cops today you're a transvestite." 

I think he's someone important Karin 

knew. An army man maybe, I don't 

know. Or, or a politician. Some people 

said she was a terrorist sympathizer 

but she liked any man with lots of 

power.


JUDE

The name. Tell me what the name is.


GEORGES

I don't know. If I did, I wouldn't 

be here. That man's the murderer.


JUDE

(face to face)

So you never knew his name? Right?


GEORGES

No. The man never told it.


Jude offers his hand. Georges takes it, stands.


JUDE

You'll be getting out. Don't worry 

at all about it.


GEORGES

(confused)

Thanks.


Jude walks out.


CUT TO:


INT. INTERROGATION HALLWAY - AFTERNOON


Gideon and FBI Interrogators meet Jude outside door.


DECT. GIDEON

Well?


JUDE

(effeminate)

The poor boy is innocent.


They all laugh.


DECT. GIDEON

You don't mean that?


JUDE

I promise you he's innocent.


Others watch as he walks off.


CUT TO:


EXT. NATA HDQTS - NIGHT


Only a few lights dot the nocturnal complex.


Jude Mazzo's office window shines particularly bright. THe 

others have gone appropriately home.


CUT TO:


INT. JUDE'S NATA OFFICE - NIGHT


Jude listens to cheap tape cassette player as he does sit-

ups. He's alone with moment of truth:


JUDE'S VOICE

"At 10 a. m., May 7, I entered the 

apartment of Karin Schreiber and 

killed her. Her murder was 

premeditated..."


JUDE

(overlapping)

...meditated...


JUDE'S VOICE

"...There is only one extenuating 

circumstance."


TIMECUT. Later. Jude, in black suit and tie, sits at desk. 

Cassette player continues:


JUDE'S VOICE

"The victim systematically..."


JUDE/JUDE'S VOICE

...made a laughing-stock of me.


JUDE'S VOICE

"...I left clues everywhere not 

purposely to sidetrack the 

investigation..."


Jude cuts off tape, continues confession from memory, his 

arms swinging:


JUDE

...Not purposely to sidetrack the 

investigation but to prove the case. 

To prove the case.


Jude restarts cassette:


JUDE'S VOICE

"I left clues everywhere, not 

purposely to sidetrack the 

investigation, but to prove the case. 

To prove the case."


JUDE

To prove the case. To prove the case.


Mazzo rewinds, restarts recording:


JUDE'S VOICE

"To prove the case. To prove the 

case. The case that I am a man 

completely above suspicion."


Jude rewinds, echos confession from memory, his arms swinging:


JUDE/JUDE'S VOICE

...that I am a man completely above 

suspicion.


JUDE'S VOICE

"...It was an idea that took control 

of me. There were..."


JUDE/JUDE'S VOICE

(tape pause)

...extenuating circumstances.


CUT TO:


EXT. L'ENFANT PLAZA - LATE NIGHT


Mazzo, clutching bulky 8x14 envelope, walks briskly across 

L'Enfant Plaza in south Washington. Square red granite 

structures enclose sterile courtyard. I.M. Pei's International 

Style complex is empty by night, eerie as Ozymandias.


Jude passes fountain lit by yellow globes, stops outside 

Postal Service West Building; he places stamped/addressed 

enevelope in mail box, enters deluxe L'Enfant Plaza Hotel.


CUT TO:


INT. L'ENFANT HOTEL LOBBY - LATE NIGHT


Jude dials from phone cubicle in deserted ostentatious 

"concourse." He hovers over receiver, places handkerchief to 

mouth as call RINGS in earpiece. Sam Zegner, hotshot reporter 

from scene 30, answers sleepily:


SAM (O.S.)

Yes?


JUDE

(disguises voice)

Sam Zegner? Crime desk?


SAM (O.S.)

Yeah, who's this?


JUDE

I can't tell you who this is. They've 

got my phone tapped.


SAM (O.S.)

Is this a joke or what?


JUDE

Listen. D.C. Homicide will tomorrow 

receive an envelope containing the 

necklace of the murdered woman Karin 

Schreiber, the killer's razor blade. 

That rules out the husband.


SAM (O.S.)

Why are you trying to disguise your 

voice? I recognized you right away.


Jude quickly hangs up, heart pounding, face flushed.


CUT TO:


INT. COMPUTER CENTER - DAY


NATA's nerve center is fully operational. Rows of isolated 

young men and women work silently in computer cubicles. Some 

replay wiretap tapes on headphones; others enter data, take 

notes.


Jude and Alan check out cubicles as they stride toward 

supercomputer. Pretty programmer in Fair Isle sweater glances 

at Jude flirtatiously, returns to monitor. Victor and Computer 

Technician work at Big Moma console.


JUDE

(to Alan)

...if the government doesn't attack 

terrorism, pornography, drugs, who 

will? The Civil Liberties Union? The 

press? The ASPCA? Of course we have 

personal rights -- society has greater 

rights! Society has the right to 

defend itself by whatever means 

necessary. Whatever means necessary.


Mazzo interrupts Victor:


JUDE

The new taps should be in -- huh, 

Victor?


VICTOR

About half, Director, but please, 

don't take on more taps without 

additional staff. We're backlogged. 

We just label and file most of them. 

Look --


Vic punches out successive screens of coded info: phone 

numbers, initials, dates, etc.


VICTOR

These are just the current taps. 

There's a million hours in storage, 

known but to God. We pulled and 

collated the Ria Maled taps you 

wanted. About 30 hours. The most 

recent two days ago. They're in your 

office. Great office, by the way, 

Director.


VOICE calls "Director Mazzo." Jude turns as Lt. Weiss 

approaches, tabloid in hand. Avery Milton follows at distance. 

Weiss catches his breath:


LT. WEISS

The killer went to the press. They 

were tipped before we got the evidence --


MILTON

(enthused)

The reporter's home phone was on 

your tap list. Can you believe such 

luck? They're locating it now.


Jude just nods, walks away.


CUT TO:


INT. JUDE'S NATA OFFICE - DAY


Mazzo's new office is even hipper than last: Casa Vogue wall 

to wall. Memphis chair, painted D.C. map, framed photos and 

faded pennant are integrated into Neo-Classical decor. One 

wall's inexplicably barren.


Jude examines log as phone wiretap plays on cassette deck. 

Weiss and Milton, standing, listen to Ria Maled speak bad 

audio with young Hispanic later known as Tomas:


TOMAS (O.S.)

Ria, where have you been? I've been 

trying to reach you.


RIA (O.S.)

I was at police headquarters all 

morning. They were questioning me 

about Karin's murder.


TOMAS (O.S.)

Did they know anything?


RIA (O.S.)

No, they were questioning all the 

residents of the building.


TOMAS (O.S.)

Not even that you'd slept with her?


RIA (O.S.)

Shut up! Don't you know my phone's 

bugged? -- and now that I'm on the 

point, I'd like to speak to the cops 

that are listening. One cop in 

particular. Comrade Officer, you 

have the disgusting job of spying on 

Third World liberation -- which you 

call "terrorism." Give up! You're 

doomed to fail --


JUDE

(rising)

Enough! Shut it off!


Milton cuts off tape. Jude looks out window as Karin's VOICE 

segues to flashback:


KARIN (V.O.)

(cruel)

You're disgusting. Will you throw 

away that undershirt?...


CUT TO:


INT. KARIN'S BEDROOM - DAY -FLASHBACK-


Nine months before. Karin, nearly naked, belittles Jude as 

she applies mascara. He buttons white shirt over undershirt, 

pulls on black nylon socks. His shirt's worn from repeated 

washings.


KARIN

...Everything you wear is impossible. 

Don't worry, I won't tell your mother. 

And change that shirt. You look like 

a head waiter. And those little black 

socks you wear like a priest. Or 

like what you really are, a policeman. 

Don't you have a suit with style? A 

bit brighter? With some life to it?


Mazzo hides behind hard expression:


JUDE

(curt)

No.


KARIN

People cross the street when they 

see you coming because they can tell 

you're a cop. You police stink of 

barracks, jails, courtrooms. Priests 

at least smell like incense. They 

ought to pass out a deodorant to the 

police and teach them to use it.


Karin crosses room as Jude knots cheap black tie. She picks 

up scissors, approaches Jude, cuts his tie slowly. Once, 

then twice. She kisses his blank face, walks to mirror. Mazzo 

waits to speak:


JUDE

I could kill you. With my own two 

hands.


KARIN

(combing hair)

Who'd catch you? You'd control the 

investigation.


END OF FLASHBACK


CUT TO:


INT. JUDE'S NATA OFFICE - DAY


Same day as previous office scene. Mazzo, Milton, Weiss and 

Alan listen to wiretap conversation. Jude's muffled phone 

voice speaks from L'Enfant lobby:


JUDE (O.S.)

...an envelope containing the necklace 

of the murdered woman Karin 

Schreiber...


Weiss turns to others:


LT. WEISS

Listen. Who does this remind you of?


JUDE

Sam Zegner?


LT. WEISS

Yes, but the other?


JUDE

(shrugs)

Where's the envelope he's talking 

about?


MILTON

FBI.


LT. WEISS

Gideon pulled rank. They were all 

over us after the story hit.


JUDE

That's it either way. That proves 

the husband's innocent.


MILTON

Just like you said. He'll be released.


LT. WEISS

(shakes head)

Gideon won't do it. He says he's in 

charge of the case and he's holding 

him and that's that.


JUDE

The man is innocent.

(walks away)

Petty bureaucrat.


CUT TO:


EXT. NATA HDQRS - EVENING


Mazzo waves off Alan:


JUDE

...didn't need security before, don't 

need it now!

(jocular)

Wouldn't I be a hell of a hostage?


Jude laughs heads for assigned space where Beretta sits washed 

and polished. Sam Zegner, lying in wait, intercepts Mazzo.


They inch toward Jude's metallic coupe.


JUDE

Sam, what -- ?


SAM

Did you read my story on the Schreiber 

necklace?

(Jude nods)

What should I tell him?


JUDE

Tell who?


SAM

Detective Gideon at the FBI.


JUDE

Tell him about what?


SAM

He wants me to tell him who tipped 

me about the envelope. You understand.


JUDE

Why are you asking me?


SAM

You made that phone call.


JUDE

Don't be stupid. How could I call 

before the package even arrived?


SAM

But you made the call!


Jude stops beside Beretta, flares back at young reporter:


JUDE

Don't you ever say a thing like that! 

That I call you! I never call you!


SAM

(vacillates)

But --


JUDE

(opens door)

I do favors for you, you know. So 

you just watch out.


Sam retreats as Director Mazzo sits in coupe, slams door, 

starts engine. Zegner's mind reels with rationalizations as 

Jude drives down 24th. File this "Forgotten."


CUT TO:


INT. BERETTA - EVENING


Jude sits behind wheel in cold sweat, suddenly frightened. 

He regulates his breathing: in-out, in-out, calming down. Is 

Jude's cool his cover? Or his turn-on?


Karin's hand flashes before his face as TRAFFIC NOISE 

dissolves to flashback.


CUT TO:


EXT. PENNSYLVANIA AVE. - DAY -FLASHBACK-


Six months before. Jude's MOVING POV through Beretta 

windshield: Karin's hand pulls away, revealing thoroughfare 

running deadend to Rotunda Dome. Pennsylvania Avenue, nation's 

#1 drag strip, stretches from White House to Capitol Hill. 

Rod Stewart sings over dashboard speakers: "Do You Think I'm 

Sexy?"


Mazzo wearing wraparound sunglasses, glances from side mirror 

to rearview to windshield. He breaks for red light. Black 

TRAFFIC OFFICER in white uniform watches intersection from 

far curb.


Karin leans to lightly kiss Jude, whispers teasingly:


KARIN

Go ahead. Go ahead, run it. You can 

do it...


JUDE

(overlapping)

I don't need to run a red light...


KARIN

(overlapping)

...I don't ask about your dirty 

investigations, you don't ask about 

my politics. Everything else is fair. 

Go on. Let's see who wins...


JUDE

(overlapping)

...so, you want me to break the law? 

Right...?


KARIN

(overlapping)

...Let's see who can dance closest 

to the flame. You can do it. Try it. 

You can do anything --


JUDE

(blustery)

Alright, I'll do it. I'm doing it!


Karin laughs as Mazzo accelerates through busy intersection. 

Suddenly, a GERIATRIC with a walker steps into their path. 

Jude prepares to break; Karin, instead, swerves the wheel 

wildly, hits horn and curses. The Geriatric freezes, 

befuddled. TRAFFIC OFFICER waves them to the curb.


KARIN

Here comes the traffic cop. Just 

show him your little card. You're 

important to our security. Show him.


JUDE

Sure, sure.


Traffic Officer stops at window, eyes Jude and Karin:


TRAFFIC OFFICER

(brusque)

Driver's license and registration.


JUDE

(displays ID)

U.S. Attorney.

(a beat)

Let's have it back.


TRAFFIC OFFICER

Director Mazzo.

(steps back)

Sorry sir.


Mazzo pockets ID wallet, drives away. He smirks as Traffic 

Officer recedes in rearview mirror.


KARIN

You could commit any crime, you know. 

You really could.


CUT TO:


INT. KARIN'S BEDROOM - DAY -FLASHBACK-


Six months before. Jude stands against Social Realist painting 

of couple in coitus, undressing as Michael Jackson et. al. 

sing "We Are the World" on stereo. Mazzo, chic in contoured 

suit, looks directly into camera as he unbuttons shirt. His 

figure's trim, his hair styled: the Jude transformation is 

complete.


Karin, propped up by wrinkled pillows, watches nude as she 

mouths words to song: "...we are the children, we are the 

ones who make a brighter day..." Twisted sheets variously 

reveal/conceal her full body tan.


Mazzo removes his trousers and undershorts, climbs across 

bed toward Karin.


Doorbell RINGS as Jude slithers belly to belly.


Karin quickly gets up, pulls on negligee.


JUDE

Don't answer.


Karin takes his hand, tugs him off bed. Jude, frightened, 

turns to hide his erection, cups genitals.


KARIN

(urgent)

Hide.


JUDE

(panic)

I can't be seen here.


Karin strongarms Jude toward large louvered closet. He reaches 

down to scoop up his trousers en route, fails.


KARIN

In here. Quick. I'm expecting an 

express package. I don't want to 

miss it. It'll just be a second.


JUDE

Really, Karin...


She opens closet door, presses reluctant Director Mazzo 

inside. Jude squats naked between hanging dresses and high 

heels. Beside him, a jumble of dirty laundry and discarded 

paperbacks.


Karin closes door with shushing gesture. Jude watches through 

slats as Karin turns off stereo, goes to front door. Bell 

RINGS again.


Schreiber peers across chain latch, smiles as she unlocks, 

opens door for Ria, wearing bright patterned shirt and 

painter's pants. They embrace as she locks door.


KARIN

Don't say a word.


RIA

What's wrong -- ?


KARIN

That's two. One more and you're gone 

for good -- and I'm not a memory men 

forget easy. I leave scars.


Karin unsnaps Ria's pants. He opens his mouth to speak, stops, 

agape.


KARIN

Don't even groan.


Karin helps Maled unbutton his shirt as they approach bed. 

She reaches in his pants holds his stiffening prick.


KARIN

It's like a hot steel pipe.


Ria bends to untie shoes. Karin sets him on bed, stretches 

him out, pulls down his pants.


KARIN

Leave the shoes on.


Karin positions herself atop Ria so that she directly faces 

Jude's hiding place.


Mazzo watches as Karin fucks without foreplay. Her eyes are 

fixed on the closet. She never looks at Ria.


Karin, heaving up, down, side to side, breathes with 

increasing theatricality: the Camille of coitus.


IN THE CLOSET, Jude, wedged into a comfortable position, 

picks a battered university press paperback from Karin's 

dirty laundry, opens it at random, reads in the dim slatted 

lights.


Playing to the closet, Karin achieves an orgasm worthy of 

Verdi.


Karin unceremoniously unstraddles Ria, rolls him off the 

bed, helps him haphazardly dress, ushering him all the while 

toward the door.


Maled, hurt, starts to say something. She cuts him short:


KARIN

Don't spoil it, Bernardo.


Karin latches chain behind Ria, leans flat against door, her 

heart suddenly pounding. Trembling, she turns toward closet.


Karin proceeds step by step into bedroom. Not a sound from 

the closet. Fear heightens her anticipation.


KARIN

Jude?


She opens closet door. Jude sits silently reading. He doesn't 

look up.


KARIN

Jude? I'm sorry.


Mazzo's expression is detached, surreal, as if about to burst 

into unthinking anger. He looks up from his book:


JUDE

Did you know there's a hole in the 

ozone layer?

(a beat)

In fifty years Baltimore will be the 

new Key West.

JUDE

Who was here?


SUEBEE

He should be ashamed.


JUDE

Who should be ashamed.


SUEBEE

Hideon. Mr. Hideon, from the FBI, he 

said. With someone else. He acted 

like you were just nobody. That's 

the way he talked to me. You should've 

heard him. He wanted a blue tie.


Mazzo walks to bedroom; Suebee follows, talking:


CUT TO:


INT. JUDE'S BEDROOM - EVENING


SUEBEE

He shoulda been ashamed, talking 

about you that way. I told him I 

would call NATA immediately if he 

didn't leave. "How dare you?" I said. 

Then they left.


Jude goes through tie rack. He peruses one blue tie after 

another: the silk Missoni is missing.


JUDE

Strange, I remember a tie like -- ?


SUEBEE

It was so wrinkled. Honestly, I don't 

know what you'd do without me. It's 

in that new batch from the cleaners.


JUDE

You didn't tell the police?


SUEBEE

Of course not. Did I do something 

wrong? Why should I?


CUT TO:


INT. JUDE'S BATHROOM - NIGHT


Mazzo extracts sky blue murder tie from dry cleaning sheath, 

cuts it up, places pieces in oversize ashtray. He ignites 

silk shards with stick matches, drops flaming fragments into 

toilet bowl, flushes them away as David Byrne sings 

"Wildlife."


CUT TO:


INT. JUDE'S OFFICE - NIGHT


Jude speaks on telephone:


JUDE

I must know, Attorney General, have 

you ordered an investigation of my 

personal life on the Schreiber case? 

Me? My own life? I must know.


ATTORNEY GENERAL (O.S.)

We can talk about it at dinner next 

week.


JUDE

No, no, excuse me, I need to know 

more.


ATTORNEY GENERAL (O.S.)

We'll talk about it then.

(hangs up)


CUT TO:


INT. KENSINGTON MD. BLOOMINDALE'S - DAY


Mazzo disguised in jeans, baseball cap and sunglasses, 

approaches Missoni boutique. Intense insecure CLERK, male, 

mid-fifties, greets Jude at counter:


CLERK

Yes?


JUDE

A friend bought me a blue silk tie 

here, and I wondered if you have 

another?


CLERK

Azure blue?


JUDE

Pale blue, yes.


CLERK

I think so. Let me check.


Clerk walks off. Jude calls after him:


JUDE

You'll know it if you find it -- a 

real murderer's tie!

(laughs)


Mazzo's hollow laugh betrays his anxiety. He notices OLDER 

WOMAN staring at him.


JUDE

What are you staring at?


CUT TO:


EXT. NATA ALLEY - DAY


Jude turns corner, walks past alley behind NATA headquarters. 

He notices "Gourmet Food" truck parked behind NATA. He pauses 

a moment, continues.


CUT TO:


INT. NATA CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY


Jude, Milton and dozen staffers sit around long table. Alan 

concludes his remarks as LEE REISMAN, 32, good-looking, very 

hip in very button-down sort of way, tiptoes into room. Mazzo 

wears same clothes as morning of murder: Sahara brown suit, 

sky blue Missoni tie.


JUDE

(looks to Lee)

Great. Before going on, I'd like to 

introduce Lee Reisman, formerly of 

the White House press office. He's 

going to be working with us the next 

couple weeks -- and that took some 

doing, by the way. Lee's here to 

protect NATA's inalienable rights: 

life, liberty and the pursuit of 

publicity!


Staffers chuckle as Reisman takes seat against wall. Reisman 

whispers memo into micro-cassette recorder.


JUDE

Now, who's writing up the report?


STAFFER

I am, Director.


JUDE

We'll need a 12 to 14 page summary 

with a half page cover memo for the 

White House. Nothing fancy. Just the 

broad strokes. The Chief of Staff 

wants the gist. More than a half-

page and he'll pass it down to a 

subordinate and later claim he wasn't 

fully informed. The gist of it is 

that, one, the creation of NATA has 

resulted in inter-governmental anti-

terror cooperation beyond all 

expectations. Two, suspects in subway 

bombing are known and being pursued 

by means which cannot be divulged. 

Three, most important, terrorist 

activities are up in every sector 

and demand immediate response in 

both manpower and materiel. Be sure 

to include some anecdotal material -- 

but not Arabs. We want to paint a 

bigger picture. Tell about the FALN 

suspect we caught driving a busload 

of school-kids to Monticello with a 

pants full of plastique. Tell about 

how we laughed when --


BOOM! An EXPLOSIVE NOISE rocks the room. Staffers, stunned, 

look around. Jude leads charge out door.


CUT TO:


INT. NATA CORRIDORS - DAY


Mazzo, Milton, Alan, Reisman, others break briskly through 

freshly painted halls. Confused employees point toward source 

of explosion.


They are joined by NATA POLICEMAN and UNDERCOVER AGENTS. One 

agent attempts to precede Mazzo; Jude elbows him back. 

Corridor buzzes with speculation. Jude continues forward, 

setting pace.


Pungent smell greets them. Smoke seeps through emergency 

exit. Jude rams open rear door, setting off ALARM. He's 

immediately outside.


CUT TO:


EXT. NATA ALLEY - DAY


Twisted Gourmet Food truck in flames, flat against NATA 

dumpster. Windows are shattered up and down alley, a few 

trees are burning. Otherwise, there seems little damage. 

SIRENS wail in distance.


The truck has absorbed most of the blast. It's nothing but a 

flaming shell. Jude's already in action:


JUDE

Tell the D.C. cops to cordon the 

area.


UNDERCOVER AGENT

A radio!


Reisman rushes inside as agents sprint opposite directions 

down alley. Jude scans bomb scene.


SECURITY POLICEMAN

Everyone stand back! It's still alive! 

Get these people back!


Chattering ONLOOKERS edge back, regroup, their ranks swelling.


ONLOOKER #1

Anybody hurt?


ONLOOKER #2

I don't think so.


ONLOOKER #3

An old lady just passed by.


ONLOOKER #4

What happened?


Jude's eyes fix on truck: he sees something. He climbs without 

warning into twisted hot metal. Someone SCREAMS. Milton and 

others yell: "Get out! Get out!"


Jude ignores their warnings, searches dashboard -- inches 

from flaming explosives. NATA agent mounts truck to rescue 

Mazzo, burns hand on strip of steel. More SCREAMS. Jude's 

coattail catches fire. Other agents, joined by D.C. Police, 

prepare to force him out.


Before they can act, Jude retrieves smoldering documents 

from glove compartment, works his way free. Jude clutches 

papers as he drops to pavement -- his jacket aflame, his 

right hand seared. Cops tug off his coat, stomp out flames. 

All eyes on Director Mazzo.


Jude dramatically displays charred documents: photos and 

floor plans of White House, Jefferson Memorial, Capitol.


Reisman returns with camera just in time to catch picture of 

Jude, burnt, smudged by smoke and debris, holding high 

frightening evidence. CLICK!


CUT TO:


INT. BLOOMINGDALE'S - DAY


Camera PANS from Washington Post PHOTO of Jude triumphant to 

reveal Dect. Gideon questioning Missoni Clerk. Gideon holds 

newspaper under arm. Headline reads: "Nata Bomb Bares Terror 

Plot."


CLERK

-- "azure." "Azure Blue." I know 

just the tie you're talking about. 

It's from the Spring Collection.


DECT. GIDEON

How many do you stock?


CLERK

Of the solids? Three or four. Someone 

was asking about that same tie just 

the other day. He bought the last 

one.


DECT. GIDEON

What did he look like?


CLERK

About your height, 45 or 50, I'm bad 

with age. He looked like that guy on 

TV last night. In the truck bombing. 

Wasn't that terrific, what he did?


Gideon places Post on counter, points to Jude's grainy black-

and-white picture.


CLERK

Yeah, that's him.


CUT TO:


INT. TV STUDIO - DAY


Jude is guest on "The Donahue Show." Jude and PHIL DONAHUE 

chat as they watch monitor: beach beauties sell diet soda on 

screen. Reisman stands behind camera crew.


Show returns live. Mazzo sits straight; Donahue waits his 

cue:


DONAHUE

We're back. Our program is on 

"Terrorism: Has it come to America?" 

and our special guest is NATA Director 

Jude Mazzo, the man who's done so 

much to help turn the tide in the 

battle against international 

terrorism.

(to Jude)

I'd like to start by congratulating 

Director Mazzo on the recent arrests --


JUDE

-- they were a group effort.


DONAHUE

What about jumping into a burning 

truck? You can't say that was a group 

effort.


Jude shrugs sheepishly, scans female audience. His eyes fix 

on young blond girl -- a girl not unlike Karin.


DONAHUE

You know, Director, I don't know 

what it is. It's like a gust of fresh 

air from Washington. I feel safer 

just sitting here talking to you.


JUDE

I never set out to be a symbol. I 

only set out to be sensible.


Donahue holds up issue of Time with Jude on cover.


DONAHUE

This is today's Time magazine. There's 

a picture of Director Mazzo and 

alongside the words, "The Jude Mood." 

What do you think of this "Jude Mood" 

that's sweeping Washington?


JUDE

Don't confuse me with the zeitgeist, 

Phil. I don't spend my time worrying 

about the National Mood. I leave 

that to the columnists.


DONAHUE

But don't you aspire to higher office?


JUDE

I've never even thought about that. 

I don't have time for personal 

ambition. I'm just trying to help my 

country. It's my job.


Spontaneous applause.


CUT TO:


INT. GIDEON'S OFFICE - DAY


Gideon watches "Donahue" in large, functional FBI office. 

One wall is covered with mug shots of interrogees in Schreiber 

investigation. Dusty pix of Reagan and Hoover flank FBI seal.


FBI Interrogator #1 and uneasy Missoni Clerk watch "Donahue" 

alongside Gideon. Yellow "FBI Evidence" tag partially blocks 

Sony screen. WOMAN IN TV AUDIENCE asks Mazzo:


TV WOMAN

Who are your heroes?


JUDE

Off the top of my head -- my father, 

of course, President Reagan, JFK, 

Lee Iacocca, Martin Luther King, 

Guglio Marconi -- and Walt Disney.


"Donahue" audience chuckles. Gideon lowers his head.


CUT TO:


EXT. FBI BULDING - DAY


Mazzo, Milton and Alan round corner, sprint up concrete steps.


CUT TO:


INT. FBI BUILDING - DAY


Interrogator #1 greets them at door, escorts Mazzo and retinue 

through security.


FBI INTERROGATOR #1

Follow me. We were just watching you 

on "Donahue," Director. I liked what 

you said. Everybody's beaming around 

here.


ALAN

Why couldn't Detective Gideon come 

to us? The Director's time is very 

important.


FBI INTERROGATOR #1

I just follow orders.


JUDE

It's alright, Alan.


They turn corner, stride in pairs down corridor.


MILTON

What's this all about? This "new 

evidence"?


FBI INTERROGATOR #1

(to Jude)

It's nothing, Director. A compulsive 

liar, if you ask me.


CUT TO:


INT. GIDEON'S OFFICE - DAY


Interrogator opens door for Jude and others, closes it behind 

them. Gideon and Clerk stand facing window. Only Gideon turns 

to Mazzo. Missoni Clerk, frightened, shuts eyes, waits to be 

called.


FBI INTERROGATOR #1

(to Clerk)

This man would like to ask you a few 

questions. Please turn around.


JUDE

Who is he?


Mazzo circles to face Clerk; Gideon stands between. Clerk 

slowly lifts eyes to Mazzo. Jude greets him with cold damning 

stare: the look that kills.


Clerk, turning to jelly, glances at others, looks back at 

Torquemada Jude.


JUDE

Well?


Missoni Clerk would be shitting if his sphincter weren't up 

his throat. He pleads:


CLERK

Excuse me, sir, there's been a 

mistake. I'm sorry. I thought you 

were someone else.


JUDE

Really? Who?


CLERK

I... must have been... I confused 

you with someone else.


JUDE

(to Gideon)

With who then?


FBI INTERROGATOR #1

He was convinced he knew you. He 

said he sold some strange man --


DECT. GIDEON

He said he sold you a silk tie 

identical to the one under victim's 

fingernail -- just twelve days ago! 

He says this man talked about murder 

and --


JUDE

Let him talk.


CLERK

Well, it was just like that. He must 

have been some lunatic or an actor 

rehearsing a role --


JUDE

(to Gideon)

Is that all?


Gideon nods. Mazzo leads Clerk to door.


JUDE

You're free to go. You did the right 

thing. Public service is always 

rewarded. We have your name.


CLERK

Thank you, sir:


Clerk exits. Jude turns on Gideon, his voice rising:


JUDE

You little shit! What did you think 

you were doing?


DECT. GIDEON

He identified your picture! How did 

I know -- ?


JUDE

Thank God I didn't hire you. You 

couldn't have lasted two days under 

me.


Gideon bites tongue, looks away. Jude yells at Milton and 

Alan:


JUDE

You two! Don't you have any respect? 

Get out!


Milton and Alan immediately leave.


JUDE

You still want that tie? It's a little 

charred from the explosion.


Gideon, looking off, shakes head -- almost imperceptibly. 

He's had enough humiliation today. Goddamn tie.


Mazzo notices wall of mug shots:


JUDE

Who are these?


DECT. GIDEON

Everyone questioned in the case.


Jude zeros in on black-and-white blow-up of Ria in protest 

tableau. His face's circled with red grease pencil. Beside 

Ria stands Tomas, 23, Puerto Rican.


JUDE

I recognize him! I saw him in the 

crowd outside her apartment! Who are 

they?


Jude pulls Ria/Tomas photo from wall, begins to fold it. 

Gideon stops him, takes photo from Jude:


DECT. GIDEON

This ain't your investigation, 

Director! This ain't your 

jurisdiction! This ain't terrorism!


JUDE

It will be! Then watch out!


Mazzo bolts out Gideon's office.


CUT TO:


EXT. 9TH STREET - DAY


Mazzo rushes from FBI Building, crosses street. Across 9th, 

Jude rests against improbable row of X-rated peep shows and 

shops -- literally in J. Edgar's shadow.


Mazzo breathes heavily, wipes his face. Even Jude can only 

suppress terror so long. He quickly pulls himself together, 

walks away.


CUT TO:


INT. COSMO CLUB BATHROOM - NIGHT


Jude, wearing tuxedo, washes hands and face in marble and 

gilt lavatory. He senses something wrong. Someone is watching 

him.


He looks at mirror: nothing. Turns his head, looks behind: 

nothing.


Mazzo looks back at mirror, only to be greeted by smiling 

Felliniesque face of LAVATORY ATTENDANT. Jude fumbles in his 

pants pocket for a tip.


CUT TO:


INT. COSMO CLUB BAR - NIGHT


Exclusive club on Mass. Ave. (women can eat but can't join). 

D.C. aristocracy sip watered drinks, wait to be seated. The 

room reeks of power. Decisions made here effect the world.


Director Mazzo and Attorney General Gabriel, also tuxedoed, 

all smiles, work bar. Jude's at the top of his game. He flirts 

with one matron in French, another Russian. Gabriel pulls 

him away:


ATTORNEY GENERAL

Com'on Director. Forgive us.


JUDE

(looks around)

So these are the smokey backrooms of 

political lore? Any tips?


ATTORNEY GENERAL

Don't play favorites. These guys are 

all powerbrokers and each has an ego 

big enough to fill RFK Stadium. Hell, 

why am I giving you tips? If I was 

so smart, I'd be the special guest 

here, not you.

(whispers)

By the way, the truck bomb was a 

stroke of genius. Really.


JUDE

We should act fast. We know all their 

names.


ATTORNEY GENERAL

Of course.


They enter dining room.


CUT TO:


INT. COSMO CLUB DINING ROOM - NIGHT


Jude sits in impressive company: Attorney General Gabriel, 

Assistant A.G., STATE DEPARTMENT UNDER-SECRETARY, PARTY 

CHAIRMAN, FINANCE MOGUL, SENIOR BUSINESS LEADER, CONSTRUCTION 

TYCOON and ASSISTANT. All wear tuxedoes.


Construction Tycoon pitches Gabriel and Jude:


CONSTRUCTION TYCOON

...That's a 2.5 billion saving right 

there. Think of the impact: prison 

space for all drug offenders. Our 

latest poll gives this program an 

84% approval -- higher than Medicare. 

Good for law enforcement, good for 

the economy, good for votes.


ASST. TO TYCOON

Here's an idea that came up: sentence 

all drug offenders to at least one 

year, then let minor offenders buy 

up to 11 months of freedom at $1000 

a day. Let the rich kids pay for the 

prisons. Each thou buys 37 

incarceration days for the next guy.


Gabriel frowns: this is not ethical. It's not even feasible.


ATTORNEY GENERAL

I have some problems with that.


Tycoon quickly changes subject:


CONSTRUCTION TYCOON

Did you read the Time cover on 

Director Mazzo? Really something.


STATE UNDER-SECRETARY

What a puff piece.


ASSISTANT A.G.

It was terrific.


PARTY CHAIRMAN

Just what we needed.


ATTORNEY GENERAL

Hard-hitting in a Princess Di sort 

of way.


STATE UNDER-SECRETARY

How'd you do it? State's been trying 

six months to get some top spin from 

Time-Life.


JUDE

(modest)

They're just selling magazines, like 

everyone else.


Senior Business Leader sets iced tea down with punctuation 

mark. Others turn. He exudes authority:


BUSINESS LEADER

Let me get to the point. I've cleared 

this with Justice, State, Chairman 

Luddy.

(acknowledges them)

You must know, Judi, that we've 

started a campaign fund in your name -- 

you don't have to comment. It's 

something we want to do. Not for 

this year, not for next -- it's just 

an idea we want to drop in the public 

consciousness. See what happens. If 

no response, it'll fade away 

unnoticed. None of us will be involved 

by name.


PARTY CHAIRMAN

We're on the look for leaders. 

Especially now. The President will 

be hard to replace. I wish we could 

just wax him and set him in the Oval 

Office.


ATTORNEY GENERAL

We damn near have.


CONSTRUCTION TYCOON

I still have problems with the family 

issue. Can a bachelor go all the 

way? How about it, Jude? Got anything 

in the works? A fiancé? I'm dead. 

You try to sell an unattached sexy 

mid-forty candidate. A fucking hormone 

bomb. I could live with a steady 

girlfriend -- "Is she or isn't she?" -- 

slash/potential fiancé/slash/wife-to-

be.


STATE UNDER-SECRETARY

I know a girl, 26, gorgeous, she'll 

fuck your brains out, small talk 

with the Prime Minister of Uganda, 

go home and beat you at chess.


JUDE

I have a private life and I'm not 

ashamed of it. Sex if a low priority 

for me. Someday -- soon -- I will 

meet the right woman and marry. The 

issue has never obstructed me. Don't 

under-estimate voters: they know 

essence from ephemera --


CONSTRUCTION TYCOON

Hah! Voters are ignorant -- and they 

make the rules --


BUSINESS LEADER

The rules change, Cal. They used to 

say a Catholic couldn't be President, 

they used to say a divorced man 

couldn't be President. Here comes 

Kennedy, here comes Reagan -- goodbye 

rules.


PARTY CHAIRMAN

The new polls show Jude just a point 

under the President in personal 

approval.


FINANCE MOGUL

"Charisma plus credibility equals 

character."


Jude studies each face. This is for real. Powerbroker central. 

Business Leader resumes conversation.


BUSINESS LEADER

I don't care what anybody says. The 

press can't make leaders. Not real 

leaders. Men the public wants to 

believe. Men who can make people 

believe any screwy thing they say. 

Big money and the media can do a 

lot, sometimes 90%, but it's always 

the 10% that matters. And you can't 

buy it. I oughtta know...

(laughs)

...I've tried often enough!


PARTY CHAIRMAN

There are those who think you have 

that 10%. You got a New Decade vibe. 

You might just be the man for the 

Nineties.


Business Leader breaks mood with robust shrug:


BUSINESS LEADER

Who knows? Now let's change the 

subject before Judi here can respond. 

How's pussy, boys?


A good old boy chuckle.


CUT TO:


EXT. WHITE HOUSE - NIGHT


Jude's Beretta heads west down 15th, circles White House. 

Jude grins -- all's right again. Off screen phone RINGS: Big 

Bopper answers from car stereo:


"CHANTILLY LACE"

"Hel-lo ba-by,

Yeah, this is the Big Bopper speakin'

(demonic laugh)

O-oh, you sweet thang! Do I what?

Will I what?

O-oh, ba-by, You kno-ow what I like!"


North portico of White House is bathed in white light. 11:00 

o'clock news. Network correspondents stand before glowing 

backdrop, file their stories. Jude sings along:


"CHANTILLY LACE"

"...make me feel real loose,

Like a long-neck goose,

Like a girl --

O-oh, ba-by, that's what I like!"


CUT TO:


EXT. NATA ALLEY - NIGHT


Unmarked military transport vans stand behind NATA head-

quarters. Sometime after midnight.


CUT TO:


INT. NATA UTILITY ROOM - NIGHT


Top floor of townhouse has been gutted, stripped back to 

sandblasted brick rectangle. Plainclothes officers line thirty 

DETAINEES, all male, in rows before folding tables. Seated 

clerks process detainees over tabletop computers.


The detainees represent terrorist nationalities: Palestinian, 

Puerto Rican, Libyan, Iranian, Sikh -- Third World all. Some 

are angry and abusive, most are frightened. Detainees reply 

as best they can, each in accent, their babel swelling like 

a mantra.


All in all, an unsettling tableau -- more secret rite than 

penal procedure.


All eyes turn as Jude enters with Milton. Jude reads from 

computer printout as he walks down the rows, inspecting 

suspects. Alan joins them.


JUDE

All my floppy disk friends. I feel 

like I know you all. Like a reunion -- 

what's the name of that film, the 

one with "Heard It Through the 

Grapevine"?


ALAN

The Big Chill.


JUDE

Yeah, it's a good thing I'm not 

sentimental.


ALAN

We've located 31 of the 55 suspects 

you requested.


JUDE

(to detainees)

You all got top grades: "Priority 

Surveillance," "Detain," "Deport." 

All connected to car bomb conspiracies -- 

however trivial.


Jude examines each passing Arab face, checks printout, nods 

as he turns down next row.


JUDE

(to Alan)

Maybe they went out with the wrong 

girl ten years ago, who knows? Most 

will be free in a few hours, but not 

all. This is the sexiest group of 

suspects we've had since Hoover. 

Just wait, something will pop up. 

Sometimes you have to throw a wide 

net.

(looks around)

Ria Maled?


ALAN

No luck.


Mazzo stops before HALUK YORGLU, young Turk in designer 

glasses.


JUDE

This is Haluk Yorglu. He and his 

brother in Ankara figured a way to 

double their drug profits by financing 

terrorism. Now he's got three lawyers 

and a press agent.

(moves on)


ALAN

We did find Tomas Donoso, the boy in 

the photo with Ria. Also on the phone 

taps.


JUDE

Where?


ALAN

Two rows over. With the Puerto Ricans.


Alan leads Jude and Milton to TOMAS DONOSO, 22, slight, 

unkempt. Tomas' boyish face bristles as they approach.


JUDE

Name?


TOMAS

(contemptuous)

So this is America? The "land of the 

free" we sang about in San Juan. 

Where's Lady Liberty now, Herr 

Director?

(clicks heels)


JUDE

(to Milton)

I'll question him tomorrow-maybe. It 

would be advisable to keep him off 

food and drink until then. "Nothing 

by mouth."


CUT TO:


INT. JUDE'S NATA OFFICE - DAY


Jude, at desk, studies Ria Maled file: photos, intelligence 

reports, wiretap transcripts. Milton enters unannounced.


JUDE

How's our boy? Tomas will lead us to 

Ria -- trust me.


MILTON

Good news. We couldn't find Ria 

because the FBI already picked him 

up. He's at the Bureau now.


JUDE

(angry)

Good news!


MILTON

I thought it was good news. Gideon 

is conducting the interrogation 

himself.


This only upsets Jude more:


JUDE

Has Ria talked? How much does he 

know?


MILTON

No idea.


JUDE

Where did you hear this?


MILTON

Lt. Weiss.


CUT TO:


EXT. DOWNTOWN WASHINGTON - DAY


Jude speaks on pay phone near corner of G Street and 10th, a 

marginal district. His voice is urgent:


JUDE

Someone must know what's going on 

over there. Why don't you just go 

and ask around?


LT. WEISS (O.S.)

I tried. The FBI denies it even has 

Maled. Gideon wants Ria all to 

himself.


JUDE

How'd you find out?


LT. WEISS (O.S.)

Two officers tried to assist the 

arrest -- the Bureau boys told them 

to keep quiet. Why don't you just 

get some agents, go over and grab 

him? Flex your jurisdiction.


JUDE

That's just it. I don't have 

jurisdiction. Not til I tie him to 

terror. Gideon's gonna screw 

everything up. I want Ria!


LT. WEISS (O.S.)

Let it go, Director. Let Gideon get 

his glory. It's just a homicide.


JUDE

Yeah, thanks.


Mazzo hangs up, walks down G Street. For the first time we 

see him not affecting a pose. "Jude walk" is now introspective 

slouch. Jude's been weaving a contradictory self-destructive 

web, and the strain shows.


Jude, lost in thought, passes prone wino. Ahead, scraggly 

STREET MUSICIAN, 40ish, wheezes Vivaldi on old flute. Dollar 

bill and several coins lie in open case at his feet: a scene 

straight from Haight-Ashbury era. Street Musician looks toward 

Mazzo expectantly, catches his eye.


Jude returns Musician's stare, slows, stops -- suddenly stoops 

to steal lone bill from flute case! Stunned flutist stops 

playing:


STREET MUSICIAN

Wha -- ?


Jude explodes with distain:


JUDE

You're so fucking bad you're lucky 

you only owe me a dollar!

(points to wino)

People are trying to sleep here!


STREET MUSICIAN

(backing away)

Really, mister, I don't think --


Jude bounces on balls of his feet:


JUDE

What are you going to do about it, 

huh? Call the cops? You're lucky I 

don't take your goddamn flute too! 

What kind of man plays the flute 

anyway?


Mazzo abruptly turns, leaving as quickly and calmly as he 

came. Just a synapse burn-off. He's better now.


Flutist watches dumbfounded. He doesn't know what hit him. 

But we do.


* Jude stops, stares into space. SOUND of breathing.


CUT TO:


INT. KARIN'S BEDROOM - DAY -FLASHBACK-


Six months before. Same as scene 72. Ria and Karin fuck. 

Mazzo peeks through closet louvers.


END OF FLASHBACK


CUT TO:


EXT. DOWNTOWN STREET - DAY


Continued from scene 89. Mazzo looks around, walks away. OFF 

SCREEN phone RINGS.


CUT TO:


INT. KARIN'S BEDROOM - DAY -FLASHBACK-


Three months before. Karin lies in bed as phone RINGS. She 

picks up receiver, listens, sits up:


KARIN

Yes, I'm alone.

(beat)

Yes, alone. I told you I am.

(beat)

What is this? A jealous tantrum on 

the phone?

(beat)

If I were you then, make your men 

tap my telephone. Or they can follow 

me. Or plant a camera between the 

sheets and that sort of thing. There 

are a hundred men at your disposal, 

right? Assign them over here. Then 

you'll always know who I'm with and 

just what I'm doing.

One month before. Jude enters apartment just as he did morning 

of murder. He unfolds letter as he walks into bedroom where 

Karin lies in negligee.


JUDE

Your letter says, "It's over. Let's 

break off our relationship now."

(laughs)

Karin, you can take this dumb romantic 

letter of yours and stick it right 

there!


Mazzo crumples letter, crams it between her legs.


KARIN

Get out!


She jumps from bed, crosses room. He follows:


JUDE

Why you afraid to stay around? Listen, 

I didn't come here to play the jealous 

boyfriend, Karin. If it's up to me, 

you can do whatever you like. If you 

want to sleep with someone else, to 

me it's unimportant...


Jude sits before her. His voice grows plaintive. He pleads 

with his fingertips:


JUDE

...But I've got to know about it! 

You must tell everything. Everything 

you do. Because we're accomplices.

(desperate)

Karin, you just can't put me in this 

sort of situation. You know I'm going 

to be promoted. I represent the Law! 

I represent power, Karin.

(angry)

The first thing you'd better do is 

get down on your knees and kiss the 

ground I walk because you're a slut! 

I want to know who this Ria is, you 

whore! Answer!


KARIN

(defiant)

He's a friend who lives in the 

building. What else do you want to 

know? He's a young man, better looking 

than you and a revolutionary, so?


Karin walks away. Jude scrambles over bed after her.


JUDE

A revolutionary! I'll kill you! Listen 

to me --


She slaps him to his knees:


KARIN

Keep your hands off me, you moron! 

You are not at the station, you are 

at my house! Get out of here!

(hits him)


JUDE

What are you doing?


KARIN

I'm not one of those helpless worms 

you step on everyday. Understand?


JUDE

Karin...


Jude falls to floor, deflecting Karin's swinging arms.


KARIN

You make love like a baby. Because 

that's what you are -- a stupid baby!


JUDE

(cringing)

Don't yell like that.


KARIN

You also wet your bed, you baby! 

You're nobody, nobody at all. As a 

man you are incompetent! You're 

sexually worse than an incompetent!


Karin wildly hits him. Jude covers his face with his hands.


JUDE

Take your hands off me! Karin, get 

your hands off me...!


KARIN

You're terrible! You're nothing, 

you're nothing, you're a baby, 

understand?


JUDE

(overlapping)

...Get your hands off me and keep 

them off me, Karin...


END OF FLASHBACK


CUT TO:


EXT. VIRGINIA COUNTRYSIDE - DAY


Jude drives through foggy Arlington woods. He can barely see 

lights of passing cars. He seems anxious, preoccupied.


Mazzo pulls Beretta off road, cuts headlights. He walks into 

woods, looking for discrete spot to take a piss. Engulfed by 

fog, he walks further than intended.


He stops, unzips, relieves himself. He looks up: towering 

trees thick with mist. He realizes he's lost, turns head 

wildly from right to left.


Panicky, Jude runs tree to tree. His heart's a jackhammer. 

Where am I?


Mazzo bursts through a grove, spots Beretta -- yellow hazard 

lights blinking -- parked placidly on state road shoulder.


Relieved, he returns to car.


CUT TO:


INT. NATA UTILITY ROOM - DAY


Brutal brick and sheetrock space now stripped clean. Overhead 

flourescent lighting eliminates shadows. Two objects remain: 

straight-back wood chair, beat-up lamp table. Water pitcher, 

drinking glass sit on table; Tomas Donoso sits on chair. He 

hangs his head. This room could be anywhere.


Jude, freshly shaved and showered, slowly paces length of 

brick wall. Tomas wears same jeans and T-shirt as night 

before. His lips are exsiccated, his saliva no longer flows. 

Tomas looks up.


Jude plays the sphinx. His expression gives no clue to his 

thoughts or intentions. Mazzo walks with measured steps to 

far wall, turns to face Tomas -- twenty feet distant. Jude, 

hands in pockets, leans against unfinished sheetrock, assumes 

stance.


Dead silence. Each watching the other. Pause. Faint rhythm 

of breathing. Inhale/exhale.


Jude breaks the tension: he opens his mouth as if to speak, 

imitates sound of ringing telephone: "Ri-ng." "Ri-ng." Jude 

hesitates, then picks up imaginary receiver in slow-motion 

pantomime, lifts it to his ear, listens.


Jude looks at Tomas, grins:


JUDE

Hel-lo, ba-by, Yeah, this is the Big 

Bopper speakin'

(demonic laugh)

O-oh, you sweet thang! Do I what? 

Will I what? O-oh, ba-by, You kno-ow 

what I like!


Jude is suddenly all movement. He charges toward Tomas, 

intoning ala Oral Roberts:


JUDE

"Something good is going to happen 

to you today!"


Mazzo steps to table, pours glass of water, offers it to 

Tomas:


JUDE

Here.


Tomas clutches glass. He swallows long and hard -- his face 

distorting as he spits out the water!


TOMAS

Salt water!


JUDE

Damn right. Sorry, you gotta drink 

it. It's a rule here. Or else you go 

on your knees.


TOMAS

Huh?


Jude yanks chair under Donoso. He butt-flops to floor. Mazzo 

kicks chair away, presses Tomas' head forward:


JUDE

Up! Up! Head down, back straight! 

That's right. Feet off the floor! 

All your weight must rest on your 

knees!

(positions Tomas)

Like that. Right. That's perfect. 

Balance -- don't move!


Jude positions Tomas' head down and forward, feet lifted -- 

a contortion designed to balance Tomas' entire weight on his 

knees, each kneecap flat against concrete.


JUDE

You'll remain like that until you 

drink the water. Then you can stand. 

It's not so bad. You'll get used to 

it. Everything's taken care of. You'll 

be home, comfortable, fed, asleep in 

an hour. There'll be no charges. We 

know the facts. You need to repeat 

them for the record. Tell us about 

Ria Maled.


Tomas bites his mute lips.


JUDE

I'm like your confessor. You can say 

anything you want in this room. Here 

everybody talks. Nothing will happen 

to you. I'm as silent as the grave. 

This whole building is one big grave.


Tomas stares ahead, struggles to maintain balance. Sweat 

drips from his unshaven chin. He wobbles, tips forward to 

floor on all fours. His lungs heave for air.


Mazzo abruptly knees Tomas, yanks him up, holds him steady 

with clenched fist. Tomas grimaces. Jude leans his face 

against his, yells point blank:


JUDE

Don't stand on all fours! You're a 

human being, boy, not an animal. 

You're a citizen of a great democracy. 

This isn't the Gestapo or the KGB. 

We want to help you. Do you want to 

stay on your knees -- or would you 

like more salt water? I don't know. 

You decide. But if you decide to get 

up, you'll have to drink the whole 

thing.


Donoso pulls himself to his feet. Jude presses salty pitcher 

against Tomas' parched lips:


JUDE

I see you decided to drink it.

(lifts pitcher)

The whole thing.


Tomas gulps as Jude pours water down his throat. Tomas gags, 

spews salt water.


JUDE

You can't, huh? Alright then, back 

on your knees.


Mazzo pressures Tomas to floor, carries pitcher to table. 

Donoso resumes kneecap position.


JUDE

(walking)

You would have been better off not 

drinking any. In ten minutes you 

could be out of here. You could be 

drinking a nice big drink of fresh 

cold water. Huh? Yes, clear nice 

good fresh water. Just tell me what 

you know.


Tomas doesn't respond. Stone-face. Mazzo speaks nonstop, 

pacing ever-constricting circles. Jude, master chameleon, 

shifts from persona to persona: one moment inquisitor, next 

moment legal brahmin, concerned observer, soulmate, tormentor, 

philosophe:


JUDE

I imagine you would call this torture, 

this tête-à-tête of ours, and, 

technically, I suppose it is -- in a 

trivial, simplistic sort of way. But 

it ain't real torture. No sir. I'll 

tell you what torture is. The worst 

torture is a life stripped of even 

the most ordinary limitations. Finding 

out one day that the rules don't 

apply to you. Somebody took down the 

fences.

(Tomas wobbles)

Straight, please!

(continues)

It ain't so easy making rules. Try 

it sometime. It sounds easy -- the 

easy part is obeying. I wanted to 

enforce the law, not dream it. What 

happened to me? "The great act of 

faith is when man decides he is not 

God" -- Oliver Wendell Holmes. Moses 

had the cushy job -- the one I wanted. 

Just bring down the commandments, 

bust sinners, kick some ass. Let God 

handle the tricky stuff --


Tomas is barely conscious. Concrete burns his kneecaps like 

hot iron. He falls woozily starboard. Mazzo brusquely corrects 

Tomas' posture:


JUDE

Back straight, son! That's it! You 

got it! Just tell me about Ria, you 

can sit in that chair. Say anything. 

about him, anything at all and you 

can sit, drink fresh water. I want 

to help you.


TOMAS

(voice breaking)

Please.


JUDE

You know Ria Maled?


TOMAS

Yes.


JUDE

You knew Karin Schreiber?


TOMAS

Yes.


JUDE

Did you conspire with Ria and Karin 

to provide logistical information to 

avowed terrorist organizations?


TOMAS

But nothing happened.


JUDE

Did you provide information?


TOMAS

Yes.


JUDE

Did you conspire to provide 

information?


TOMAS

Yes.


JUDE

Are you sorry for what you've done?


TOMAS

(clutching Jude's leg)

Yes.


JUDE

What was the relationship of Ria 

Maled and Karin Schreiber?


TOMAS

They were friends.


JUDE

Did they have relations?


TOMAS

I don't know.


JUDE

Just what was their relationship?


Tomas' face is livid -- devoid of color.


TOMAS

He was in love with her.


CUT TO:


INT. TOP FLOOR CORRIDOR - DAY


Jude steps into hallway, closes metal door as he greets 

Milton, Lt. Weiss and NATA POLICEMAN. He instructs Policeman:


JUDE

Give him some water, food, anything 

he wants. Clean him up.


NATA POLICEMAN

Yes, Director.


JUDE

Then release him. Drive him home.

(to Weiss & Milton)

Our boy implicated Ria. Get a writ 

and get Ria over here.


CUT TO:


INT. NATA UTILITY ROOM - DAY


Mazzo waits alone for Ria. He picks up lone chair, places it 

one spot, then another. Changing his mind, Jude sets chair 

against far sheetrock wall. Wood chair legs scrape against 

concrete floor.


Jude sits. He crosses his legs, leans back as smug and suave 

as Cary Grant.


Iron door opens. NATA Policemen escort hostile Ria Maled 

inside. Ria's shirt is sweat-stained from FBI interrogation. 

His hair disheveled.


JUDE

(to police)

Leave me alone with him. You two get 

some coffee.


Ria watches as guards exit, lock door behind them. Jude calls 

from across room:


JUDE

I hear you put on quite a show for 

the FBI. A real Rambo. Didn't tell 

them a thing.


Ria doesn't answer. Jude stands, slowly paces:


JUDE

Well, this isn't the FBI, Ria. This 

is just you and me. No one can see 

us, no one can hear us. Look around, 

this is the whole world -- and I'm 

just the only other person in it. 

Just us, like the Garden of Eden. I 

just took a vote: you get to be Eve.


Now behind Ria, Mazzo turns, says sharply:


JUDE

You know, your "comrade" just informed 

on you! You know your next ten years 

are in jail, Ria! That's the minimum, 

and I'll see to it you get more than 

that!


Maled, head erect, stalks the mighty Mazzo:


RIA

(arrogant)

Ria Maled. Born Torino, Settembre 

1969. Chemistry major, Sorbonne. Not 

affiliated with any party. 

Revolutionary. Foot soldier in 

international struggle to liberate 

all oppressed --


JUDE

(interrupts)

Don't yell. Don't yell.

(beat)

And do you know who I am?


RIA

You were her lover. The gentleman 

who used to call on Mrs. Schreiber, 

the woman who was killed.


JUDE

By who and when?


RIA

In my opinion the murderer was you. 

You murdered her the morning of May 

7. Just before we met each other at 

the door, remember?


JUDE

Since you're absolutely sure I did 

it, you ought to turn me in.


RIA

You'd like that, wouldn't you?


JUDE

(slaps Ria)

Go on, tell them!


Ria winces with the blow, barks back:


RIA

We'd like you to remain right where 

you are! A real murderer in charge 

of the latest purges --


Jude grabs Ria with both hands, thrashes him about, slams 

him against brick wall. Jude starts to panic, his face phobic. 

They yell, overlapping:


JUDE

(desperate)

Report me! Turn me in! You must do 

it! I broke the law and I must pay! 

You must do what I say! I must pay! 

You must turn me in!


RIA

(derisive)

Murderer! Murderer! It's perfect! A 

sex killer in the White House! 

Perfect! Absolutely perfect! Go on, 

do your job!


Maled stumbles free, starts toward door, looks back:


RIA

Why don't you turn me in?


JUDE

(unraveled)

Because I'm a decent man! Help me!


Ria pounds on metal door:


RIA

Open up!

(to Jude)

And the next time we plan anything, 

I'll give you a call, Director, 

because we got you in our pocket and 

you go to Hell!

(pounds door)

Open up! Let me outta here!


Jude rambles in vain from far wall. Ria, pounding door, 

doesn't hear.


JUDE

(plaintive)

Wait, come back here. Let's talk 

this over. We've got a lot to talk 

about. You're behaving like a child. 

Let's talk this over man to man.


RIA

Let me out!


JUDE

Stop --


NATA Policemen open door, restrain Ria. Puzzled Milton edges 

past, looks to Jude for explanation. Director Mazzo composes 

himself.


JUDE

No, no, it's nothing, Milt. He can 

get out. He can get out. It's alright.


Milton nods, follows Maled and officers down corridor. Jude, 

alone, wanders toward table, collecting his thoughts:


JUDE

(muttering)

He wouldn't turn me in, he's just a 

student, a nobody...


Jude pulls Monte Blanc pen from vest pocket, uncaps it. He 

opens table drawer, takes out blank sheet of paper. He places 

paper on table, prepares to write.


JUDE

"we've got you in our pocket, 

understand...?"


He starts to write.


EXT. JUSTICE DEPT. - DAY


Gideon confronts Jude at entrance.


JUDE

The missing link.


DECT. GIDEON

I know everything.


JUDE

Congratulations.


DECT. GIDEON

I've been thinking about you day and 

night and I've decided to kill you. 

It's the only way to stop you.


JUDE

I'm impressed.


DECT. GIDEON

Some people say Huey Long was 

murdered. You and I know the truth: 

America was rescued.


JUDE

Let me get this straight: you kill 

me so you can go down in history as 

a wacko assassin while I, with 

schoolbook hyperbole, am canonized 

the American martyr? This you're 

willing to accept because secretly 

you and only you know you've saved 

America from Jude Mazzo?


DECT. GIDEON

Yes.


JUDE

And what happens when they open my 

blood-soaked suit coat and retrieve 

this envelope --

(taps vest pocket)

-- a full confession of my crimes up 

to and including the murder? How 

will you look then?


DECT. GIDEON

You lie.


JUDE

People like you always underestimate 

people like me. Go ahead. Take a 

chance. Go for it.


Gideon hesitates. Jude turns and walks away.


CUT TO:


INT. JUSTICE DEPT. - DAY


Deco murals line echoing corridor. A distant silhouette, 

heels clicking like metronome. The Jude walk. He carries 

folded hand-written letter.


Jude enters "Office of the Attorney General" without knocking. 

Representations of "Blind Justice" and "Scales of Justice" 

are painted above stone lintel.


CUT TO:


INT. ATTORNEY GENERAL'S OFFICE - DAY


The Assistant A.G., caught by surprise, bolts from boss's 

chair.


ASSISTANT A.G.

Wha -- ?

(nervous)

Director Mazzo?


JUDE

Where's Attorney General Gabriel?


ASSISTANT A.G.

(walks around desk)

At the White House. I was just --


JUDE

(imperious)

You'll never understand the magnitude 

of my action or my sacrifice. I walk 

in here to reaffirm my trust in the 

purity of authority and the impartial 

glory of the Law --

(withdraws letter)

-- and who do I get to look at? A 

lacky little bureaucrat!


ASSISTANT A.G.

What have I done?


Jude hands Assistant A.G. folded letter:


JUDE

I hand you the solution to the killing 

of Karin Schreiber. From this moment 

on I am at the disposal of the wheels 

of Justice. The FBI will want to 

interrogate me so I will be at my 

apartment.


Assistant Attorney General opens letter as Jude leaves.


CUT TO:


EXT. WASHINGTON HARBOUR - EVENING


Jude parks Beretta coupe, enters building. The sun, red from 

refracted smog, hovers over skyline.


CUT TO:


INT. JUDE'S BEDROOM - NIGHT


Light falls through doorway. Jude lies coffin-like atop 

bedspread. He stares at ceiling, hands clasped beneath his 

head. His jacket hangs neatly over chair. Jude's tie glows 

against white shirt -- a sky blue gash from neck to navel.


Rolling Stones blare from living room stereo: "It's only 

rock and roll, but I like it, I like it."


Jude looks toward door: what's taking them so long?


CUT TO:


INT. JUDE'S LIVING ROOM - NIGHT


Jude lifts horizontal blind, looks out window. Rolling Stones 

sing unaffected by timecut: "It's only rock and roll."


He sees: Detective Gideon, on stakeout, staring back at Jude. 

Gideon stands beside unmarked car, brightly lit by floodlamp. 

Gideon makes no attempt to hide. He's just watching. Jude 

turns away anxiously. What's taking them so long?


CUT TO:


INT. JUDE'S OFFICE - NIGHT


Jude roams office. Rolling Stones continue uninterrupted: 

"But I like it."


He drifts past gallery of framed photos and souvenirs. Mazzo's 

eyes pan eclectic memories: Yale Law School diploma, faded 

snapshot of proud mother with smiling son, hand-written note 

from the President. What's taking them so long?


Jude glances out window: Gideon stands watch. He removes 

legal textbook, Capital Offenses, from shelf, opens it on 

desk. He flips to chapter heading, "Origins of Insanity 

Defense," says something to himself, walks away.


Mazzo looks out window again. This time he sees line of 

headlights snaking through Washington Harbour complex. Gideon 

turns to greet approaching cars.


CUT TO:


EXT. WASHINGTON HARBOUR - NIGHT


Three navy blue sedans park near side entrance. Very low 

profile: no motorcycles, no bumper flags. Each car carries 

four men.


Twelve car doors swing open simultaneously. Dark-suited 

officials squeeze out, stretch their legs, wordlessly assemble 

behind second vehicle. They include: Attorney General Gabriel, 

Assistant Attorney General, State Dept. Under Secretary, 

Party Chairman, Milton, Reisman, Lt. Weiss and FBI officers.


Gideon confers with Gabriel. They speak confidentially, 

nodding in turns.


The chauffeurs, plainclothesmen; assume prearranged positions, 

scan for suspicious activities. Not a soul in sight.


Attorney General leads the way inside. Others follow according 

to rank. Reisman's last.


CUT TO:


INT. 1ST FLOOR HALL - NIGHT


Entourage proceeds double-file, oblivious to trompe l'oeil 

decor. They wait for elevator, compact inside.


CUT TO:


INT. ELEVATOR - NIGHT


Officials, squeezed tall and tight-assed, stare at digital 

LED. Elevator lifts from "1" to "2." They file out.


CUT TO:


INT. 2ND FLOOR HALL - NIGHT


Twisting down Etruscan corridor, they approach Jude's 

apartment. Rolling Stones echo inside. Gabriel double-checks 

entourage, presses door bell.


CUT TO:


INT. JUDE'S LIVING ROOM - NIGHT


Jude, face freshly washed, pulls on jacket, crosses room. He 

turns off stereo ("...but I -- CLICK"), opens door.


Each official silently nods as he enters. Milton attempts 

feeble greeting. Reisman shuts door. Plainclothesmen remain 

outside.


Mazzo stands against stark wall as his visitors, nine strong, 

form semi-circle around him. Attorney General Gabriel 

confronts Jude face to face, sadly shakes his head.


Jude's eyes well up. He lowers his head, unable to face his 

mentor. He can hardly speak:


JUDE

I've disgraced you. I'm sorry, sir. 

There is no excuse.


Gabriel gently taps Jude's cheek, turns away. Gideon assumes 

interrogator's stance directly behind Mazzo. He speaks over 

Jude's shoulder, for all to hear:


DECT. GIDEON

Where were you ten o'clock the morning 

of May 7th? The day of Karin 

Schreiber's murder?


JUDE

(regains composure)

I can tell you exactly. I can tell 

you the whole story. Because I was 

there. I killed her.


A.G. Gabriel, nonplussed, weaves through group:


ATTORNEY GENERAL

You must prove that now. Do you think 

you can?


JUDE

Unfortunately there was a witness. 

The Italian student, Ria Maled, who's 

a subversive, was at the entrance. 

He saw me leaving.


DECT. GIDEON

We know that and it's not true since 

Ria Maled has a valid alibi. He was 

in Vermont. I questioned him myself 

for hours. And you know how thorough 

I am.


Jude's visitor's react in concert. Mazzo's confused:


JUDE

You remember those bloody footprints 

all over the victim's apartment? I 

didn't leave them to sidetrack the 

investigation, however they did come 

from my left shoe!


Mazzo yanks off black dress shoe, displays sole. Gabriel 

takes shoe, compares it to his own:


ATTORNEY GENERAL

There are literally thousands of 

shoes of the same size and make -- 

this for example.


PARTY CHAIRMAN

I own an identical pair.


ASSISTANT A.G.

So do I.


JUDE

But in the apartment there were my 

fingerprints. Doesn't that prove it 

to you? Even on the faucets in the 

shower. Because I killed her and 

then... and then I used the bathroom.


ATTORNEY GENERAL

Strange, according to the report we 

studied everything thoroughly. We 

find other fingerprints, but yours -- 

not a one.


Increasingly upset, Mazzo squirms as they obfuscate his every 

word. Jude thrusts his tie toward Gideon like an accusing 

finger:


JUDE

That blue thread you took out of her 

fingernail? It came from a tie just 

like this.


DECT. GIDEON

Then show us the tie with the missing 

thread.


Gideon has done an ideological 180°.


JUDE

I destroyed it.


ATTORNEY GENERAL

Why? Tell me.


JUDE

Because my emotions were mixed. 

Whether to confess my crime and be 

put in jail or to use the power I 

had to smooth it over. I admit, I 

wanted to know if I really had that 

power. I got carried away.


ATTORNEY GENERAL

You were hallucinating your own 

indecision. You have a neurosis.


Jude grows more manic with each rebuttal:


JUDE

Yes, but probably this disease was 

contracted during this long permanent 

unbroken exercise of power. You might 

call it a professional illness or an 

example of an occupational disease 

that punishes those who control our 

helpless little society.


PARTY CHAIRMAN

That's impossible.


LT. WEISS

We're all healthy here so cut the 

psychological crap. We must have 

absolute actual proof you're guilty, 

you know that. Not just words, facts. 

Evidence!


JUDE

But what about the man I bought the 

second tie from? At the store?


DECT. GIDEON

That's false. He doesn't know you.


JUDE

But I can tell you this between us, 

he denied it because he was scared. 

When he learned who I was!


ATTORNEY GENERAL

I will not permit you to insult all 

our findings. You are insulting me, 

your colleagues and the law 

enforcement establishment.


DECT. GIDEON

Let's be more concrete. Your motive? 

What motive did you have?


Mazzo paces wildly:


JUDE

She made fun of me! She made fun of 

me! And the whole department! The 

whole department! And of the 

establishment! All of us! The Law 

itself!


ATTORNEY GENERAL

That's hearsay and not evidence. You 

cannot prove that so it never 

happened!


Jude takes Gabriel momentarily aside:


JUDE

(whispers)

Everyday she tortured me more. She 

treated me like an infant.


ATTORNEY GENERAL

(to others)

Nonsense! Science fiction!


JUDE

I murdered her out of jealousy!


MILTON

You never knew her!


OTHERS

Evidence! We need evidence!


LT. WEISS

You can't prove it.


Jude flails, spinning one way then another:


JUDE

Gentlemen! Alright! Just a moment. 

You want proof? I'll bring you the 

proof now. In just one moment. You'll 

see I'm guilty.


They settle. Jude pats coiffure into place, walks quickly 

into his office. Officials band together sotto voce. From 

Jude's office: SOUND of drawer unlocked, opened, shut.


Mazzo reappears brandishing 8x10 black-and-white photos, 

strides back speaking. His energy level's off the meter:


JUDE

Gentlemen, Attorney General, look at 

these photos -- dirty pictures! -- 

the murder victim spread out in 

various erotic poses perversely 

imitating the cheapest crime magazines --

(distributes photos)

-- all taken by me in her apartment, 

making use of my passion for amateur 

photography -- which you know! Look, 

you can even see me in the mirror in 

this one! I want you to examine them.


Attorney General Gabriel accepts Jude's first extended photo; 

then, slowly, dramatically, rips the 8x10 apart, dropping 

torn pieces to floor. He doesn't even look at photo. It's 

irrelevant.


JUDE

Examine them!


Gabriel's subordinates follow suit, shred "crime scene" 

glossies: SLOW MOTION fragments of Karin Schreiber, posed, 

nude, flutter down like dying butterflies. Jude spins, caught 

in surreal shower of photo-erotic memories.


Mazzo struggles to stop them:


JUDE

Please! No! You can't ignore the 

facts!


Weiss and Gideon wrestle Jude to floor, subdue him amid torn 

porn. Jude's protests blur incoherently.


ANONYMOUS VOICE

It's a disgrace.


ANONYMOUS VOICE

It makes your flesh crawl.


ANONYMOUS VOICE

I always said he was never a team 

player.


Attorney General steps over Jude, peers down. Mazzo 

submissively looks up to Gabriel:


JUDE

What do you want? What? I'll do 

whatever you say.


OTHERS

Ah! Good! Finally!


PARTY CHAIRMAN

Bravo, bravo!


JUDE

What do you want?


ATTORNEY GENERAL

Get on your knees, Jude. You must do 

something for your country.

(a beat)

You must confess your innocence.


STATE UNDER-SECRETARY

It's best for everyone.


ATTORNEY GENERAL

On your knees, Jude.


JUDE

But the public? When they find out?


ASSISTANT A.G.

Nothing to find out.


PARTY CHAIRMAN

They want to believe you.


ASSISTANT A.G.

A delusion.


ATTORNEY GENERAL

On your knees!


Gideon helps Jude to his feet.


ATTORNEY GENERAL

Say it!


Jude lifts eyes to Gabriel:


JUDE

I confess my innocence.


CHEER goes up. Reisman appears with bottle of champagne, 

pops cork! Communal laughs as drinks are poured.


Attorney General and Party Chairman heartily clasp, 

congratulate Mazzo. Jude accepts anonymous glass of champagne. 

He drinks with foamy smile.


ATTORNEY GENERAL

It's all over, Jude.

(laughs)

Just like a movie.


DECT. GIDEON
