"STONE MY HEART"


Written by


Michael Roemer


2001


UNPRODUCED




TITLES


Under the titles, we see LORI, a woman in her early twenties, 

walking along a crowded Boston sidewalk. We watch her through 

a long lens. Others move in and out of focus, but she remains 

sharp.


Lori turns into the doorway of a liquor store but stops short, 

then continues in very slowly.


INT. LIQUOR STORE


As Lori moves forward into the store, we see why she 

hesitated.


A teenager in sunglasses uses a gun to wave her to the rear, 

where another customer, a young man, is standing captive.


A second gunman in his early twenties is cleaning out the 

cash register. He keeps his weapon pointed at the middle-

aged storekeeper and his assistant.


The young gunman checks out the camera around Lori's neck --


LORI

I really need it!


The gunman slips it off her shoulder.


The second gunman comes out from behind the counter and heads 

for the door. The young one follows him out, playfully 

grabbing a bottle from a shelf.


The blast of a shotgun crumples him to the floor. His older 

companion leaps back into the store, fires in the direction 

of the counter, then dashes out into the street.


The storekeeper, clutching a shotgun, is in a state of 

panicked relief. He is not hurt.


STOREKEEPER

I got one! I got the bastard!


His assistant is on the telephone.


Lori and the young man are down on the floor. They get up, 

stunned.


The gunman by the door is dead. Liquor splashes down on him 

from a broken bottle.


The young man, DAVID, kneels beside him.


STOREKEEPER

Don't touch him! Wait for the cops!


DAVID

He's gone.


He stands up, his hands and shirt spattered with blood. Lori 

is badly shaken --


LORI

Oh Jesus!


She turns to the storekeeper --


LORI

They were leaving! You didn't have 

to shoot!


STOREKEEPER

(furious)

That was my money, lady!

(to his assistant)

'You hear that?!

(to Lori)

That was three hun'red bucks they 

took -- and it ain't the first time!


We hear sirens approaching. Lori turns and hurries out of 

the store.


STREET OUTSIDE LIQUOR STORE


David leaves the store and makes his way through the crowd 

that has gathered.


He looks around, then runs up the street with Lori's camera.


He catches up with her at an intersection, where she has 

stopped for a light. He hands her the camera. She glances at 

him. He is in his mid-twenties, with a kind, intelligent 

face.


LORI

Thanks.


DAVID

I've got a car -- can I take you 

some place?


Lori shakes her head, then changes her mind.


LORI

Yeah, thanks.


INT. LORI'S APARTMENT


The phone is ringing as Lori unlocks the door. She and David 

enter.


We are in a large, one-room apartment with kitchen facilities 

on one side. The ceiling is high and the woodwork around the 

windows suggests that the place was once elegant.


Lori has just moved in. There is a pile of furniture, boxes 

with books, and a foam-rubber mattress on the floor. The 

walls are white, but one side is redecorated in a vivid blue. 

A ladder and some paint stand where the paint stops.


LORI

You can wash up over there.


She answers the phone --


LORI

Hello -- Where are you? Speak up, 

Kare, I can't hear you. You sound 

weird -- is he there? Not now. 

Tomorrow is okay.


She hangs up.


David has washed up as well as he can and is looking at some 

canvases leaning against the wall.


LORI

D'you want some coffee?


DAVID

Sure.


Lori opens the kitchen cabinets, looking for the coffee.


DAVID

(indicating the 

paintings)

Yours?


LORI

The small ones. I can't find the 

coffee. There's a place on the corner.


She turns to the door --


LORI

I don't know your name.


DAVID

David. Coolidge.


LORI

I'm Lori.

(with a faint smile)

Not a good way to meet, was it?


STREET IN FRONT OF LORI'S HOUSE


The camera pans with a motorcycle. It stops next to a jeep, 

in which Lori and David are about to leave.


The driver of the bike raises the dark visor on his helmet. 

RICK is seventeen. There is a girl on the seat behind him.


RICK

'lo, Lori.


LORI

(startled)

Hello, Rick.


RICK

(to the girl behind 

him)

Mona -- meet my big sister.


Mona smiles at Lori. She is fifteen. Her right arm is in a 

cast up to her elbow.


RICK

I tried callin' you. Can you put us 

up?


LORI

No, I'm sorry. I got just one room 

and Karen's coming.


RICK

(to Mona)

I told ya!


He guns the engine and roars down the street, but changes 

his mind and returns to the jeep. He glares at his sister --


RICK

Jus' gimme some money. She hasn't 

eaten since Ohio.


Lori opens her wallet and hands him a twenty-dollar bill.


RICK

(holding it up)

What's that?!


LORI

Rick, I'm just making it. I don't 

have a job till September.


DAVID

(to Lori)

They can stay at my place.


LORI

No way!


RICK

(to Lori)

Jesus! What's the matter with you?!

(to David)

'Couple-a days, that's all. We got 

sleeping bags.


LORI

That's not going to work!


RICK

(to David)

Go ahead -- we'll follow.


He takes off on his bike.


DAVID

It's okay. Really.


LORI

You don't know him!


NORTH SHORE ROAD


Shot from the open Jeep: we are traveling along the coastal 

highway north of Boston.


Rick is ahead of us.


EXT. DAVID'S HOUSE


The motorcade comes down the driveway of a large, old summer 

home on the shore of a lake.


LIVING ROOM, DAVID'S HOUSE


Like the house, the room is large but not ostentatious. The 

furniture, some of it shrouded in dustcovers, is old 

fashioned. Through the windows and French doors, we see the 

rich green of a garden. The effect is pleasant and comforting.


Rick enters from the porch ahead of Lori, David, and Mona. 

As he stalks around the room inspecting it, we get our first 

close look at him. He is small and slight, with hollow cheeks 

and a pale complexion. His face, like his body, is never at 

rest; when he isn't talking, he tends to grimace or turn his 

head suddenly, as if he were being followed.


RICK

Doin' all right, Lori!

(to David)

What 'you do -- own a bank?


David isn't put off by Rick's aggression. He treats him like 

a poorly adjusted teenager --


DAVID

(with a grin)

I work in a hospital.


RICK

(inspecting a silver 

cigar box)

'You a doctor?


DAVID

Med school.


RICK

'Ever work a bug house?


DAVID

No.


Rick goes into a series of spastic contortions that are 

clearly meant to suggest insanity. His mouth opens in a 

voiceless scream and his right hand turns into a claw. He 

drops the act as suddenly as he began it.


RICK

My mom freaked out before she died.


He has stopped in front of Lori. She looks at him, very upset. 

This is the first she has heard of her mother's death.


LORI

Why didn't you call?!


RICK

I told ya -- I tried!


He is seized by a coughing fit that turns into an asthma 

attack. He turns away, wheezing and trying to breathe.


Lori touches him.


RICK

I'm okay. Jus' leave me alone!


He pulls out an inhaler and uses it. The attack subsides.


Mona has remained timidly in the background. Now she 

approaches him --


RICK

(turning on her)

For Chris'sake, Mona -- don't ya get 

nothin' right?!


He stalks out of the room.


Lori looks after him, her face grave.


THE LAKE (EARLY EVENING)


Lori is in a kayak on the calm water. David's house is in 

the background, and a few other summer homes, some quite 

grand, are visible along the shore. Lori is adrift, grateful 

to be alone.


THE DOCK


Like the grounds surrounding the house, the waterfront is 

overgrown. Lori beaches the kayak. Rick is sitting in an old 

row-boat, playing a Jew's harp. Mona stands beside the dock, 

up to her waist in water, trying to wash without wetting her 

cast.


RICK

(to Lori, subdued)

'Wouldn't have made no difference if 

you'd come. 'Happened real fast.


LORI

I'm sorry you were alone.


He shrugs.


RICK

I had her cremated. That's what she 

wanted. I figured we'd have some 

kind-a service. Church. Whatever.


Lori nods.


RICK

'Karen okay?


LORI

She says she's leaving him. They're 

up in New Hampshire.


Rick pushes off in the row boat.


After a moment, Lori kneels on the dock beside Mona and helps 

her wash her back. Mona smiles at her --


MONA

Thanks.


PICNIC AREA IN BACK OF HOUSE (EVENING)


The sky is still bright, but the area is illuminated by a 

string of light bulbs. Rick prowls around, tense and restless. 

He has a plate with a chicken leg and some potato chips, 

which he crumbles in his fingers.


Lori is in a swing-chair hung from an old tree. Mona sits at 

her feet, combing her hair, and David is cooking at the 

charcoal broiler.


Rick stops and watches a seagull, hung high in the evening 

sky.


RICK

(to Lori)

I should-a been a bird. That would-a 

made everybody happy.


Lori takes a sip from a can of beer.


He saunters away.


LORI

Where're you from, Mona?


MONA

L.A., I guess.


LORI

'Your folks there?


MONA

Utah.


LORI

How long have you been with him?


MONA

'Couple-a weeks. He don't want me.


Lori nods.


Rick comes up to them --


RICK

(to Mona)

What 'you talkin' about?


Mona shakes her head.


RICK

Hey, I asked you something!


MONA

Nothin'.


RICK

Okay -- let's go!


MONA

You said we're gonna sleep here.


RICK

I changed my mind.


LORI

That doesn't make sense.


RICK

(to Mona)

Let's go!


MONA

Just tonight? It's so pretty.


RICK

You were talkin' about me!


LORI

It was my fault, Ricky.


RICK

(to Mona)

'You comin' or not?!


He gets on his bike.


Mona takes Lori's hand. When she smiles, her face looks even 

sadder.


MONA

'Bye.

(to David)

I can tell you really love each other.


She gives Lori a hug, and climbs onto the back of the bike.


Rick guns the engine and takes off.


LORI

(to David)

'See what I mean?!


WATERFRONT (NIGHT)


David turns on the dock light.


Lori is swimming toward him.


He puts down a full bottle of beer next to one she has 

emptied.


LORI

Thanks. Maybe I'll get some sleep.


She reaches up and takes a sip --


DAVID

Were you born in L.A.?


LORI

Right here. In Acton.


DAVID

You have a sister.


LORI

Yeah. She's not in great shape either.


She takes another sip of beer and swims away, like a bright 

fish in the dark water.


HALLWAY, WITH STAIRS TO SECOND FLOOR (NIGHT)


A mechanized chair, the kind invalids use, is moving toward 

Lori and David, who are at the foot of the stairs.


DAVID

It's for my grandma.


The chair stops and Lori sits down on it. She is a little 

unsteady from the beer.


LORI

'Bet your folks are nice and normal.


DAVID

(with a smile)

Yeah.


He pushes a button and the chair starts up.


Lori recedes from the camera.


A BEDROOM


The room is dark. David turns on the light and walks toward 

a large four-poster. He is carrying a set of sheets.


Lori walks around the bed --


LORI

Like a stage!

(she smiles at David)

Greatest show on earth. Performances 

nightly -- matinees Saturday, Sunday, 

and all legal holidays. Children not 

admitted -- unless accompanied by an 

adult.


David grins. He is making the bed.


Lori goes into the bathroom. Through the open door, we see 

her at the sink, brushing her teeth with her right index 

finger.


She comes back into the bedroom and takes the sheet from him --


LORI

I'll do it.


DAVID

Sleep well.


LORI

D'you have a girl?


DAVID

(at the door)

No. Not now.


LORI

How come?


DAVID

I dropped out of school for a year. 

She found someone else.


LORI

Don't get involved with me!


She closes the door, excluding him.


BACK OF THE HOUSE (MORNING SUNSHINE)


Lori is drinking coffee at the picnic table. Behind her, a 

sprinkler sends water arching across the lawn.


We hear a motorcycle approach. A moment later, Rick appears 

in the driveway. He pulls up next to Lori.


LORI

Hi. Where d'you stay?


RICK

Bus depot.


David has come out with a pot of coffee.


LORI

You dumped her?


RICK

Yeah.


LORI

Great!


DAVID

'Want some breakfast?


RICK

Nah.

(to Lori)

I called Logan. They got the ashes. 

Will ya come?


LORI

(after a moment)

Okay.


She finishes her coffee and gets up.


LORI

'Bye, David. Thanks a lot!


Rick hands her a helmet.


DAVID

When can I see you?


LORI

I've thought about it.

(she shakes her head, 

then kisses him 

quickly)

Thanks for being so nice.


She climbs onto the bike. The camera is close on her face. 

When the bike pulls away, our image of her rapidly transforms 

into a long shot.


INT. AIR-FREIGHT SHED, LOGAN AIRPORT


A small cardboard box is riding on a motorized baggage car.


The car stops. A clerk picks up the box and puts it on the 

counter in front of Lori and Rick.


CLERK

(tearing off the 

packing slip)

That's eighteen-fifty.


Lori pays. Rick stares at the package, then turns away, pulls 

out the inhaler, and uses it.


INT. DINER


Lori and Rick enter and sit down at the counter. He is 

carrying the box.


The place is empty except for two truck drivers at the far 

side. The counterman is talking to them while cleaning his 

grill.


Rick uses a switchblade to slice into the cardboard wrapper.


LORI

Not here, Rick!


He puts his knife away, takes a plastic urn out of the box 

and puts it on the counter. Lori moves it to the empty stool 

beside her.


RICK

She knew she didn't do right by you. 

She even asked to see a priest.


Lori looks at him and puts her hand on his.


A derelict has come into the diner. He approaches, looking 

for a handout.


RICK

Give him a buck -- I'll pay ya back.


Lori gets out her wallet. The counterman comes over --


COUNTERMAN

(to the derelict)

I told you -- not in here!


Rick takes a dollar from Lori and hands it to the derelict, 

but the counterman re-possesses it and plunks it on the 

counter.


COUNTERMAN

I don't want him here.


The derelict turns and heads for the door.


Rick is very upset. He jumps up, follows the man, takes him 

by the arm, and leads him back to the counter.


RICK

(to the counterman)

'Order of eggs an' toast. And coffee!


He sits the derelict down on the seat next to his own.


COUNTERMAN

I ain't serving him!


RICK

Make that English muffins!


COUNTERMAN

(to the derelict)

Get out-a here!

(to Rick)

You too -- get out!


RICK

'You gonna make me?!


The two teamsters have been watching from the other side. 

Now the older one, a man in his fifties, speaks up --


TEAMSTER

It's his place, fella!


The derelict has started up, but Rick restrains him.


RICK

You're okay! Sit down.


LORI

(quietly but tense)

Let him be, Rick. He wants no part 

of it.


The derelict stumbles toward the door.


Lori gets up and puts a dollar on the counter --


LORI

(to Rick)

Let's go!


Rick ignores her and remains seated --


RICK

(to the counterman)

I'll take some of that crummy-looking 

pie!


COUNTERMAN

You heard me! Out!


RICK

Like hell!


Now the younger teamster, a heavy-set man in his thirties, 

speaks up --


YOUNGER TEAMSTER

Hey, he told you to beat it!


LORI

Let's go, Rick.


He slaps her hand away and lays his switchblade on the 

counter.


YOUNGER TEAMSTER

Jesus!


He stands up and moves toward them --


LORI

(very tense)

Give me that knife!


RICK

Stay out of it!


YOUNGER TEAMSTER

I'm gonna count to three and you 

give it to her. One...


Lori picks up her shoulder bag as though she were leaving, 

but makes a sudden grab for the knife. Rick shoves her into 

an empty table.


The older teamster helps her up.


YOUNGER TEAMSTER

Two...


LORI

Stay away from him! Please! He's 

sick.


Rick is panicked. He swivels back and forth on his seat -- 

then grabs the knife, stabs it into the counter, and flings 

it across the floor.


The teamster continues toward him --


RICK

(frightened)

Don't touch me, shithead!


The teamster grabs him by the scruff of the neck, pulls him 

off the stool, and propels him toward the door. Rick looks 

like a helpless rabbit.


YOUNGER TEAMSTER

Get yourself a gun next time, punk!


He shoves Rick out the door and goes back to his place at 

the counter.


The older teamster hands Lori her shoulder bag --


TEAMSTER

Dump your boyfriend, miss!


Lori picks up the box with the ashes. She looks utterly 

defeated.


PARKING LOT, DINER


Rick roars toward us on his bike, his face hidden behind the 

visor of his helmet. He stops for Lori.


LORI

(shaking her head)

No way!


RICK

Gimme that!


He grabs the box of ashes from her, revs up the engine, and 

takes off.


LORI'S PLACE (LATER AFTERNOON)


The house door is unlocked and Lori enters.


David is sitting on the floor with a book --


DAVID

Hi.


LORI

How d'you get in?


DAVID

Your sister.


LORI

You don't quit, do you.


He smiles.


Through the half-open bathroom door, we see a girl drying 

herself after a shower. Lori closes the door.


LORI

(to David)

I'm glad you came.


The phone rings. Before Lori can get to it, her sister KAREN 

comes out of the bathroom in a terry cloth robe --


KAREN

It's for me.

(she picks up the 

receiver)

Hello -- No, Roy, it's your baby 

daughter. I'm thinking about school -- 

that's why I called. I'm broke. Will 

you get me into U-Mass?

(sarcastically)

Thanks a whole lot, Daddy!


She hangs up. Karen is a year younger than Lori. She has a 

striking face and a beautiful figure, but there is something 

unstable and vulnerable about her.


KAREN

(to Lori)

He says he's got no money.


LORI

That's true.


KAREN

His wife does! He paid for you, didn't 

he?! At least he could get me in.


LORI

He's part-time. He's got no pull.


Karen looks a bit unsteady on her feet --


LORI

All right, Kare -- what're you on?


KAREN

Downs. Just a couple.


LORI

Did you leave him?


Karen nods.


KAREN

I like your friend.

(she turns to David)

We had a nice talk.


The belt of Karen's robe has dropped and Lori picks it up 

for her.


KAREN

(to Lori)

I'm a lot better-looking, but you 

get all the decent guys.

(to David)

Don't you think I'm better-looking?


DAVID

(with a grin)

It's a toss up.


KAREN

Smart, too!


She leans on the table to steady herself --


LORI

That's more than a couple of downs! 

Look, you can stay here -- But no 

drugs and no men!


KAREN

It's been rough, Lori. Rick called. 

He told me about Mom.


She looks at Lori, close to tears, and buries her face against 

her. Lori comforts her.


INT. LAUNDROMAT (LATE AFTERNOON)


Lori and Karen are doing their laundry.


A man enters. VINCE is in his early twenties, heavy-set, but 

not tall, with a round, expressionless face.


Lori glances at him and looks at Karen --


KAREN

'lo, Vince.


VINCE

(to Karen)

'Guy at her place told me where to 

find you. I brought your stuff. You 

left half of it.


KAREN

Thanks.


VINCE

We gotta talk.


KAREN

There's no point, Vinnie.


VINCE

You don't just walk out! Come on!


LORI

You heard her!


VINCE

(to Lori)

Yeah, and you stay out of it!

(to Karen)

We don't have to live at that motel.


KAREN

That isn't it, Vinnie.


He takes her arm --


VINCE

Let's go!


LORI

Take your hands off her!


VINCE

(to Lori)

Hey, what ('d) I tell you??!


KAREN

(to Lori)

I'll be right back.


She leaves with Vince.


LORI'S PLACE


Karen is picking up her things and putting them into a bag.


There is a knock at the door and David opens it. Lori comes 

in, her arms piled high with laundry.


LORI

(to Karen)

What're you doing?!


Karen looks at her and shrugs --


LORI

You're staying here!


KAREN

I don't know, Lori. He wants me back.


LORI

So what?! You don't want him!


KAREN

At least he wants me.


LORI

So do I.


KAREN

No, you don't. You'll throw me out 

in three days, like last time.


LORI

Give it a chance, will you?!


There is a knock and Karen heads for the door --


LORI

Karen, don't!


But Karen opens the door for Vince --


VINCE

Where's your stuff?


LORI

Vince, she's sick!


KAREN

No, I'm not.


LORI

Look at you! Nine months ago you 

were clean! That's true, Kare. You're 

killing yourself.


Vince has picked up Karen's bag and is on his way to the 

door.


LORI

(to Karen)

Okay -- it's your life.

(to Vince)

If anything happens to her --

(she stops)


Vince walks out.


Lori approaches Karen for one last try --


LORI

For Chris' sake, Karen --


KAREN

I'm pregnant.


LORI

Jesus!


KAREN

I want to have it.


LORI

You're crazy!!


The phone is ringing.


KAREN

Thanks for caring.

(she hugs Lori)

'By, David. Good luck, you guys.


She leaves.


Lori picks up the receiver --


LORI

There's no one here!


She bangs it down. There is a pause. She looks utterly 

discouraged.


LORI

'Mind if we go to your place?


DAVID

Sure.


She starts collecting her things, but stops --


LORI

You know I'm just using you.


DAVID

(with a smile)

'Doesn't feel too bad.


THE LAKE AT DAVID'S HOUSE (TWILIGHT)


David is rowing. Lori is at the stern, lost in thought.


She sees him looking at her.


LORI

You're crazy.


DOCK (TWILIGHT)


David is securing the boat. He holds out his hand to Lori 

and she comes ashore. They stand opposite each other for a 

moment. He caresses her arm --


DAVID

'Mind?


She shakes her head.


KITCHEN (NIGHT)


David is washing the supper dishes and Lori dries them.


LORI

You're the first rich guy I like.


DAVID

We're not rich.


LORI

In my book you are.


She takes a sip from a tall glass of beer and looks at him --


LORI

Don't expect too much. I've been off 

men for a year.


She smiles at him.


DAVID'S BEDROOM (NIGHT)


Lori and David are in bed. She is listening to the soft night 

sounds of the countryside.


LORI

I'm not moving in.


NORTH SHORE YACHT BASIN (AFTERNOON SUN)


Rick rides into the dock area, past an array of yachts.


Lori is sitting on the deck of a sailboat, sunning herself. 

David and CHRIS, a boy of fifteen, are getting ready to cast 

off.


Rick pulls up in front of Lori --


RICK

I'm on my way. 'See ya.


Lori looks at him.


RICK

You look real upset!


LORI

What about money?


Rick ignores her. He uses his feet to propel himself alongside 

the boat and stops opposite David --


RICK

Nice toy!


David smiles and points to Chris --


DAVID

It's his.


RICK

(to Chris)

Who're you?!


Chris doesn't know what to make of Rick's aggression --


CHRIS

Chris.


Rick gets off his bike and takes the urn out of the saddlebag.


RICK

(to David)

'Mind if I come?


DAVID

(glancing at Lori)

No.


Rick jumps aboard and Chris hands him a life vest.


Rick's mood has lightened considerably --


RICK

Hey, Uncle David -- how come I don't 

bug you?!


DAVID

(with a grin)

Disappointed?


RICK

Nah. You're the first guy my sister's 

hooked up with who doesn't make me 

puke.


BOAT


We are running before the wind. Chris is at the bow, adjusting 

the jib. David is at the rudder.


Lori knows how to sail and is handling the boom. Rick sits 

on the floor below her, with the urn in his lap. He opens 

it, and fishes out a blackened wedding ring --


RICK

She never took it off.

(handing her the urn)

Do it, will ya?


Lori scatters the ashes into the sea, flecking the white 

foam of the wake with gray.


Rick watches for a moment, polishing the ring on his shirt 

front. Then he puts it on his finger --


LORI

Don't. It's bad luck.


He moves away.


Lori empties the urn and drops it into the water. It recedes 

rapidly, bobbing on the wake. Some of the ashes have stuck 

to her hand. She leans over the gunwale and washes them off.


Rick returns with an expensive-looking naval telescope. He 

trains it on the distant urn -- then turns it on David.


RICK

(with a grin)

When I was nine, I put a firecracker 

in a Coke bottle. 'Got vision in 

just one eye.


He sits down beside Lori, suddenly subdued.


RICK

This shrink in L.A. says I ought-a 

see my father. 'You got his address?


Lori nods.


YACHT BASIN


The sailboat docks. Rick jumps ashore and heads for his bike.


Lori watches from the deck. He looks small and forlorn.


RICK

'See you guys.


Lori comes ashore --


LORI

Take care, Rick -- I wish I could 

help.


RICK

Yeah.


He turns to David, who is securing the boat --


RICK

(lightly)

'See ya around, Uncle David.


David approaches him --


RICK

What 'you gonna do -- shake hands?


DAVID

Why not?


He and Rick shake hands.


RICK

'Wanna adopt me?


DAVID

I don't think so.


RICK

Well, take care'a her. She's okay, 

even if she's my sister.


He climbs on his bike.


RICK

(reading from a scrap 

of paper)

420 Charles -- where's that?

(he turns to Lori)

Will ya come?


Lori shakes her head.


RICK

You're the one he likes!


LORI

I don't want to see him.


RICK

Yeah. Me neither!


After a moment's hesitation, she joins him on the bike --


LORI

'No trouble, okay!?

(to David)

I'll call you.


INT. MUSEUM


Rick and Lori are on a balcony overlooking a gallery and the 

lobby. Lori is looking at a painting. Rick is watching a 

small group of men and women. ROY McIVER, a man in his 

forties, is lecturing to them.


Rick takes the telescope from the boat out of his jacket and 

trains it on the lobby.


Through the telescopic lens we see Roy dismiss his class and 

walk over to the side of the lobby. A woman rises from a 

bench to meet him.


RICK

Is that Number Three?


Lori turns to him and sees the telescope --


LORI

(angrily)

Jesus, Rick! Give me that!


He hands her the telescope --


RICK

She ain't his wife, is she?


Lori shakes her head.


RICK

Same old story!


LORI

'Might be a friend.


RICK

(scornfully)

'Wanna bet!? Fuck him! Let's go.


They leave.


EXT. MUSEUM


A brightly colored sports car pulls up in front of the 

building, and Roy gets in. The woman from the lobby is 

driving.


As the car pulls away, it passes Lori and Rick, who are 

getting onto his bike.


Rick takes off after it.


CITY STREET


Rick's bike is weaving through traffic, tailing the sports 

car.


We see Lori shouting into Rick's ear. He slows down and heads 

for the curb to let her off, but changes his mind and 

continues in pursuit of the car.


HIGHWAY


Rick is still following the sports car. When it pulls off 

the highway onto an exit ramp, he turns off as well. He stops 

at the top of the ramp, above a large motel.


Lori has jumped off the bike.


RICK

'Be right back!


He lifts the camera off her shoulder and rides down the ramp.


Lori is left behind -- furious but helpless. She walks to 

the edge of the highway and looks for a ride. A pick up stops 

almost immediately and the door is thrown open. Lori doesn't 

like the face of the driver and turns away.


She sits down on the grass. After a moment, she raises the 

telescope to her eye and trains it on the motel.


EXT. MOTEL


Telescopic lens: Roy and the woman are walking along the 

second-floor landing. He unlocks one of the rooms and they 

enter. The woman appears in the picture-frame window. She 

looks out briefly, then draws the curtain.


The lens shifts to the far end of the landing: Rick has come 

up the stairs. He sees something off screen and ducks behind 

a Coke machine.


Roy has left the room with an ice bucket and goes down the 

nearest stairway.


Rick emerges out of hiding and approaches Roy's room. He 

seems to know that Lori is watching and waves in her 

direction. Then he knocks at the door.


The woman opens. She is in her slip. When she sees Rick, she 

tries to close the door, but he forces his way in. They both 

disappear inside for a moment -- then she reappears, moving 

backwards and clutching her dress. She looks terrified.


Rick follows her out and closes the door, locking her out. 

He rips the dress from her hands and tosses it down over the 

railing. Then he raises the camera and takes some pictures 

of her.


When he is done, he moves rapidly along the landing and down 

the stairs.


The woman sits down in front of the locked door and hides 

her face on her knees.


HIGHWAY AND RAMP


Rick roars up the one-way ramp toward Lori, swerving around 

an on-coming car that honks at him furiously. He stops in 

front of her.


RICK

I'll mail 'em to his wife!


Lori is utterly disgusted --


LORI

How sick can you get!?


RICK

Let's go.


With no viable alternative, she gets on the bike.


GAS STATION ON HIGHWAY (SUNSET)


Rick is filling air into his tires.


Something off screen catches his attention.


Quick pan to the highway: the sports car passes in traffic.


Rick jumps onto his bike and shoots over to a phone booth, 

where Lori is completing a call. He waves to her impatiently. 

She hangs up and comes out -- unaware of why he is rushing 

her.


LORI

Just drop me in town.


COASTAL HIGHWAY (THE SUN IS LOW IN THE SKY)


We are traveling behind Rick's bike, moving very fast.


When the sports car comes into view, Lori realizes what Rick 

is up to. She leans forward and shouts into his ear, but he 

ignores her and pulls down his visor. Short of causing a 

wreck, Lori is helpless. She lowers her own visor and turns 

away.


Roy is driving the sports car, with the woman beside him. 

Rick pulls up on the passenger side, coming close enough to 

touch it. The woman glances at him. Though his face is hidden 

behind the dark plastic, she seems to sense who he is and 

turns to Roy, panicked.


Rick accelerates and shoots ahead. The sports car follows in 

pursuit of him. Both vehicles weave in and out of traffic at 

high speed, but the bike is far more maneuverable and pulls 

away.


Rick glances back. The sports car is nowhere in sight. He 

slows down, makes a U-turn through a break in the center 

mall, and heads back. He is driving more slowly, watching 

the other side of the road. Lori raises the visor on her 

helmet.


Up ahead, a strange spectacle presents itself. A Catholic 

priest is running across the highway, holding up the skirts 

of his cassock. A moment later, we see that several cars 

have stopped on the other side. There has been an accident.


Rick pulls over. Lori gets off the bike and runs across the 

center mall.


ACCIDENT SITE (SUNSET)


We are at the foot of a concrete bridge that takes the road 

over a tidal inlet.


The sports car has gone out of control. We can see one wheel 

sticking out of the water, some fifteen yards off shore.


A few of the cars have directed their headlights onto the 

scene to help in the rescue operation.


Lori arrives as two men wade ashore out of the shallow water. 

They are carrying the woman's body. They put her down and 

one of them tries mouth-to-mouth resuscitation. Her dress is 

up on her thigh. She looks dead.


Lori strips off her shoes and plunges into the water. Several 

other men are wading back from the wreck.


MAN

(calling to her)

'Nobody else out there!


LORI

Yes, there is!


She swims out. Although it is too dark to see anything, she 

starts diving. One of the men joins her.


Rick has arrived on his bike and stops next to the woman's 

body. Someone covers it with a coat.


Rick looks devastated. He keeps shaking his head, unable to 

take in what has happened. Dazed, he walks down to the water's 

edge and wades in.


LORI

(calling to him)

Stay where you are!


Rick continues in, but Lori comes over and pushes him back.


LORI

(fiercely)

Get out! I don't want to start looking 

for you.


He goes ashore and Lori wades back into the water. The man 

has given up --


MAN

(to Lori)

'Gotta wait for lights.


Lori continues in and dives a couple of times. Then she, 

too, comes ashore, utterly exhausted.


At the top of the embankment, a rescue truck from the fire 

department has arrived. Several firemen come down to the 

water with a stretcher. They pass Lori and Rick, who are on 

their way up.


TOP OF EMBANKMENT (SUNSET)


Lori is ahead of Rick. She sees that he has trouble pushing 

his bike up the slope and turns to help him.


He stops at the top, winded. Lori looks at him. We see him 

against the bustle of the rescue effort below.


RICK

We gotta do somethin' --


LORI

What?!


Lori sits down, shaking with cold. He takes off his jacket 

and puts it around her shoulders.


Lori looks at him --


LORI

Okay, Rick -- just go! Leave right 

now!


RICK

No way!


LORI

Don't argue! Just go.


RICK

It was my fault.


LORI

You didn't plan it! Let me handle 

it.


RICK

What 'you gonna do?


LORI

I don't know. I guess see Helen --


RICK

His wife?


Lori doesn't answer --


RICK

Jesus! I ain't leavin'!


Lori stands up. She can't take anymore --


LORI

Okay, Rick, you go and see her!


She turns to leave.


RICK

Don't, Lori!


He looks at her, a frightened, helpless kid. She sees that 

he is incapable of any action and picks up the bike for him --


LORI

There's nothing you can do. You didn't 

mean for it to happen. Go on!


He gets on his bike --


LORI

Go!


He starts the engine. She kisses him very quickly --


LORI

Call me tomorrow, wherever you are -- 

okay?


She steps back and he takes off, hunched over and forlorn.


She stays a moment longer, then walks away from the accident 

site.


LOBBY OF APARTMENT HOUSE (NIGHT)


Lori enters in the background and walks to the elevator. She 

is wearing a dress. She presses the button. A moment later, 

to the sound of a musical bell, the doors slide open.


Roy is standing inside the car, facing her. He, too, has 

changed his clothes.


Lori is stunned. She stares at him, her eyes turning cold. 

He, too, is startled.


ROY

Hi, Lori.


She says nothing.


He tries to appear calm, but the tension shows clearly --


ROY

D'you have a boyfriend in my building?


He steps out of the elevator, but has waited too long, and 

the closing doors hit him.


Lori turns sharply and walks to the door. Just then, Rick 

enters the lobby. He sees Roy and stops.


ROY

(surprised again, 

nervously)

Hello, Rick -- I didn't know you 

were in town.


RICK

(to Lori)

'Good thing I didn' leave!


The shock of seeing Roy alive has snapped him out of his 

depression. He circles around his father --


ROY

(uncomfortable)

How's your mother?


RICK

You don't want to know.


Roy looks uncertainly from Lori to Rick --


ROY

I guess you want to see me.

(to Lori)

Call me in the morning, will you? I 

have to pick up Helen in Rockport.


RICK

Helen -- she's who we wanna see. 

We're coming!


ROY

That's not going to work.


RICK

It's gonna work jus' fine!

(to Lori)

You don't have to go. I'll take care'a 

this!


Lori walks out of the lobby. Roy follows her --


ROY

Lori!


We hear the sound of Rick's Jew's harp.


EXT. APARTMENT HOUSE DRIVEWAY (NIGHT)


Lori is walking rapidly. Roy catches up with her --


ROY

What's the matter with him? He gets 

worse every time.


Lori stares at him --


LORI

I wonder why!


Rick joins them as Roy unlocks his car --


RICK

Like I said, Lori, go on home. Get 

married -- have kids!

(to Roy)

I'll be right behind you.


Roy looks confused --


ROY

(to Lori)

I've had a couple of drinks -- Could 

you drive?


Lori wants badly to get away, but sees the potential for 

more violence and takes the keys.


ROY

Thank you.


LORI

(sharply)

Just shut up! Don't talk to me!


INT. ROY'S CAR (NIGHT)


Lori is driving, keeping her eyes rigidly on the road.


Roy has withdrawn into a shell, but when Lori takes a ramp 

onto a highway, he comes to with a start --


ROY

Not this way!


LORI

You said Rockport.


ROY

I know -- I just...


He stops and lights a cigarette.


From a shot through the windshield, we see we are on the 

same coastal road we traveled in the afternoon.


There is a tense silence.


LORI

This is crazy!

(she slows down the 

car)

Don't you know we know!?


Just then, Rick appears in the open window beside Roy -- 

effectively blocking Lori from pulling over and stopping. 

The visor on his helmet is down but he faces Roy.


ROY

Oh God, it was him!


Rick points ahead.


Through the windshield we see a series of yellow blinker-

lights along the road.


Rick pulls ahead and stops on the shoulder. Lori pulls up 

behind him.


ACCIDENT SITE (NIGHT)


We are on the embankment above the tidal inlet. Below, the 

sports car has been hauled out of the water. It is illuminated 

by flickering smudge pots. The bright paint is streaked with 

mud, but the car is otherwise undamaged.


Lori gets out. Roy remains in his seat, devastated. The 

blinker lights give his face a yellow cast.


Finally, he gets out and follows Lori down the embankment. 

He hits some gravel and slides. Lori stops and helps him up.


ROY

I panicked, Lori -- It happened too 

fast.


Lori can't stand to be near him and moves away.


Down below, Rick has been looking through the car. He comes 

up with a picture postcard --


RICK

(reading)

"Dear Mom, Dad, and Sissie -- Camp 

is great!"


ROY

(to Lori)

She was dead. She was.


RICK

How d'you know?


ROY

(snapping at him)

I was there!


RICK

Yeah! I bet you took her pulse! 

Underwater!


ROY

(to Lori)

I tried pulling her out!


LORI

(barely in command of 

her voice)

You're going to the cops!


RICK

Right. We'll take you. Come on!


He heads up the embankment.


ROY

I panicked.


Lori turns away and he follows her up the slope.


INT. ROY'S CAR (NIGHT)


Lori is driving. Silence.


ROY

I have to call Helen. Could you stop?


EXT. GAS STATION (NIGHT)


Roy is in the phone booth.


Lori is leaning against the car, looking at the ground.


Rick is on his bike, using his inhaler.


Roy comes out of the booth. He seems more in command of 

himself.


ROY

I talked to my lawyer. He says to do 

nothing without him.


This new evasion is too much for Rick. He jumps off his bike 

and moves toward Roy --


RICK

Screw that! You're turning yourself 

in!


ROY

Don't talk to me like that!

(to Lori)

It's such a mess!

(overcome by 

hopelessness)

Her husband and I teach in the same 

department -- we know their kids --


Lori has made a decision --


LORI

Come on, Rick.


RICK

Like hell!


LORI

Let's go!


RICK

What're you trying to do?!


LORI

I want us out!


RICK

No way! He did it to her jus' like 

he did to Mom --

(turning to Roy)

You're going to the cops!


ROY

What d'you want, Rick?! If you weren't 

such a maniac, the whole thing 

wouldn't have happened!


RICK

(to Lori)

Now it's my fault, right?!


ROY

That thing at the motel -- doing 

that to a woman -- it's sick -- it's 

crazy!


Rick moves toward his father --


RICK

Maybe, you creep! But I didn't let 

her drown!


Lori has moved between them and puts her hands on Rick --


LORI

Let's go, Rick -- Come on -- you 

gotta let it go!


Rick is in tears. Lori puts her arms around him.


ROY

He's out of his mind --


LORI

(turning to Roy, 

fiercely)

Get in your car!


Roy gets into his car.


Rick starts coughing. He shakes off Lori --


RICK

He'll get away with it! I know he 

will! Wait a minute -- I got those 

pi'tures!

(to Roy)

I got pi'tures of you -- I got some 

of her --


He is holding up Lori's camera --


ROY

(to Lori)

What's he talking about?


RICK

I'll send'm to Helen -- I'll stick'em 

up all over U-Mass!


Roy is ashen-faced.


LORI

(to Roy)

Just go, will you?!


Roy takes off.


Rick thrusts Lori's camera into the air like a trophy.


MTA TROLLEY SHED (NIGHT)


A large hulking shed, which serves as a terminal for trackless 

trolleys. It is open to the street at both ends.


Rick comes in on his bike and Lori gets off.


LORI

I need my camera.


RICK

'You kidding?!


LORI

Keep the film -- just give me the 

camera.


Rick tries to open the camera but can't find the release. 

She holds out her hand and he gives it to her.


Lori springs it open. Then, with a quick motion, she pulls 

the exposed film out of the cartridge into the light.


Rick cries out as though he had been hit. He grabs the camera 

with the useless film hanging out of it and smashes it to 

the cement floor.


RICK

What's the matter with you?! 'You 

crazy?!


Lori, too, is very upset --


LORI

It's the only way --


RICK

You're on his side! Ya always were!


LORI

I'm on no side! There aren't any 

sides! I just want out!


RICK

(strangely quiet)

Sure, Lori. 'See ya in hell!


He starts his bike and roars out of the shed.


Lori picks up her camera, but is so distressed that when she 

is down, she stays on her knees for a moment.


INT. LORI'S PLACE (NIGHT)


Lori enters.


David is waiting for her. He nods Hello, but signals something 

with his eyes. The camera follows his glance. Roy is at the 

stove, lighting a cigarette on one of the burners. He turns 

off the gas and faces Lori nervously --


LORI

(very tense)

Get out!


ROY

We have to talk, Lori.


LORI

Just get out!


David is about to leave --


LORI

(to David)

Don't! Please stay.


ROY

You've got to hear me.


She snaps on the radio to drown out his voice.


ROY

I know there's no excuse. But I didn't 

get her killed! That wasn't my fault --


LORI

It's never your fault!


ROY

I know there's no excuse. But don't 

let him use the pictures! They'll 

hurt a lot of innocent people!


Lori hides her face in her hands.


ROY

Did you hear me?


Lori looks up and stares at him.


LORI

(flatly)

He won't be using them.


ROY

Are you sure?


LORI

What you do about that woman or her 

family, that's between you and 

yourself. But if you ever try to 

call or see me again --


She stops, goes into the bathroom and closes the door.


Roy glances at David, his face ravaged by shame. He turns to 

leave.


JEEP (NIGHT)


David is driving. Lori is next to him, with her hair blowing 

wildly over her face.


DAVID'S LIVING ROOM (NIGHT)


Lori is sitting on the sofa. David approaches from behind 

and puts his hand on her shoulder --


LORI

If they weren't my family, I could 

walk away.


DAVID

You can walk away.


LORI

They won't let me.


DAVID

(gently)

You don't let yourself.


LORI

(flaring up)

You know nothing about it! You don't 

have any problems! You just have 

answers!


DAVID

Yeah. It's easy to talk.


She touches his hand.


THE LAKE (DAWN)


Lori is sitting at the water's edge. The tranquil lake 

reflects the early light. Birds have begun to sing.


DAVID'S BEDROOM (DAWN)


Lori approaches the bed. David is sleeping.


She touches his bare back. He opens his eyes and turns to 

her.


Gravely and in silence she starts making love to him.


FRONT LAWN (BRIGHT MORNING SUNSHINE)


We are looking down from the bedroom window. A middle-aged 

man is cutting the lawn with a power mower.


David enters the frame, pushing an old lady in a wheel chair. 

A nurse in a white uniform walks a few steps behind them.


Lori is at the window. She has just woken up.


KITCHEN


A well-dressed, kindly looking woman in her fifties is at 

the sink, rinsing an accumulation of dishes.


Lori enters.


THE WOMAN

Hi. I'm Betsy, David's stepmother --

(with a smile)

-- to be.


LORI

(indicating the dishes)

I'll do that.


BETSY

All done.


Lori helps herself to orange juice from the refrigerator.


BETSY

I'm sorry we didn't call. We're taking 

Grandma up to Maine, so we stopped 

by.


She joins Lori at the table --


BETSY

I'm glad to meet you. David looks 

happy.


LORI

Well, it isn't me.


BETSY

He's been through a lot. It's good 

to see him smile.


LORI

He hasn't told me.


BETSY

He doesn't talk about it. His mom 

died last fall. He took care of her.


LORI

Oh. Well, he's taking care of me 

now.


BETSY

(with a smile)

It's not the same thing, is it?


INT. NEW ENGLAND TEA ROOM (SUNLIGHT)


Mr. Coolidge and Betsy are having breakfast with Lori and 

David.


MR. COOLIDGE

(pouring Lori's coffee)

David says you teach art.


LORI

I'm just starting.


She is a bit uncomfortable. Mr. Coolidge, like Betsy, is a 

warm and kindly person -- a warmth and kindness clearly rooted 

in privilege.


MR. COOLIDGE

It must be very satisfying. David's 

mother loved art. She used to do 

watercolors.


BETSY

We hope you'll come in and have dinner 

with us.


LORI

Thank you.


She is finding it hard to maintain her composure.


Suddenly she puts down her fork and gets up --


LORI

(getting up)

Excuse me. It was nice to meet you -- 

Good-bye.


She leaves the table. Betsy and Mr. Coolidge look bewildered.


DAVID

'Be right back.


He follows Lori and catches up with her in the entrance hall.


She is putting on her jacket --


DAVID

What happened?


LORI

If they knew me, they'd freak out!


DAVID

No, they wouldn't.


LORI

Come on, David -- they'd disown you.


DAVID

That's crap! They said how much they 

like you.


She is crying openly now. He embraces her --


DAVID

Lori, you're great. You're so 

terrific.


She leaves.


EXT. DAVID'S HOUSE (AFTERNOON LIGHT)


Lori and Chris are clearing the overgrown garden. Chris is 

raking leaves and Lori piles dead branches onto a fire.


Rick comes down the driveway on his bike, pursued by a large 

barking dog. Scared and furious, he drives around the lawn 

trying to shake it. Chris calls the dog by name and collars 

it.


Rick gets off his bike in a rage --


RICK

Lousy mutt!

(to Chris)

'Ought-a kick your ass!


CHRIS

He doesn't bite!


The dog continues barking at Rick --


RICK

Get him out-a here!


LORI

(she can see what's 

coming)

Go home, Chris -- okay?

(to Rick)

I don't want you here.


Chris whistles to his dog and heads down the driveway.


Rick turns to Lori. She sees him through the distorting haze 

above the fire. He has stuck a set of plastic vampire fangs 

into his mouth.


RICK

'Think ya got away with it, don't 

ya?!


He mounts his bike and rides it around the fire, then shoots 

off into the trees and disappears. There is a loud crash.


Lori runs into the woods.


WOODS


The bike has hit a tree and Rick is lying several yards away, 

face down and motionless.


Lori stops, terrified.


Rick opens his eyes and grins at her.


KITCHEN


Lori is on the phone, but keeps an eye on the door to the 

yard --


LORI

Betsy? It's Lori. Is David there?


Rick appears in the doorway --


LORI

Did he say where? Thanks, no.


She hangs up.


Rick circles around the kitchen and stops in front of her --


RICK

Tell ya what I'll do --


He pulls a small gun out of his windbreaker and puts it under 

his chin, with the muzzle pointing up --


RICK

All ya gotta do now is wink -- like 

so...

(he winks)

...an' I'll never bug you again!


He sticks the gun into his mouth, but continues talking --


RICK

Here's your chance, Lori. Don't blow 

it!


Lori doesn't know whether he is crazy or just pretending to 

be.


LORI

(as calmly as she can)

Put it down. Please!


He pockets it.


RICK

That guy is dead!


He walks out.


THE FRONT OF DAVID'S HOUSE


David is coming down the driveway in his Jeep. He meets Rick, 

who is walking away from the house. David stops for him but 

Rick walks past him.


Lori has come out. She joins David --


LORI

He's got a gun.


DAVID

I'll call the cops.


LORI

No, he'll get himself killed. Talk 

to him. Maybe he'll listen to you.


David starts the Jeep. Lori climbs in.


STREET BEYOND DRIVEWAY


The Jeep catches up with Rick and stops.


RICK

(to David, with a 

grin)

'She got ya workin' for her!


A small plane passes overhead and Rick aims his gun at it.


RICK

(pocketing the gun)

It ain't loaded.


DAVID

Where 're you headed?


RICK

(to Lori)

He's got a class at two. 'Gonna scare 

him, that's all.


He climbs over the side of the Jeep into the rear seat.


RICK

(after a moment)

Are we going, or what?!


David starts the engine --


LORI

(to David)

What're you doing?


RICK

Relax -- he's got a plan. Right, 

Uncle David?!


MUSEUM PARKING LOT


The Jeep stops and Rick jumps over the side.


RICK

Now look -- if one-a you yells or 

tries anything...

(to Lori)

...like that bit with the pi'tures -- 

I start shooting and I don't care 

who I hit!


INT. MUSEUM


Rick is leading Lori and David rapidly through a gallery. 

His right hand is inside his windbreaker. He knows that David, 

who is staying very close, is just waiting for a chance to 

jump him. With a grin, he opens his jacket and shows him the 

pistol, pointed at his own heart.


He stops at the top of the marble stairway that leads into 

the lobby, leans over the balustrade, and nods at a cluster 

of men and women --


RICK

They're waiting for him! You guys 

can go.


Lori has had a very hard time staying under control. She 

can't tell whether Rick is actually planning to shoot Roy, 

or just wants to torture her. She has had it and starts down 

the stairs --


RICK

Not that way! Get back!

(to David)

Tell her to get back!


He aims his gun down into the lobby --


DAVID

Come back, Lori!


She stops on the stairs --


RICK

Up here, Mommy!


Lori heads back up the stairs.


Down below, a guard is talking to the group, which begins to 

disperse.


RICK

He's not coming!

(yelling down)

What happened?

(to Lori)

You called him!


LORI

(exploding)

I called him?! When?! How could I?! 

I've been running after you, scared 

out of my skull! Give me that gun, 

you jerk!


Rick's sense of confidence has crumbled. He turns away.


MUSEUM CORRIDOR


Lori and David are walking a short distance behind Rick. He 

goes into a men's room. David is about to follow him --


LORI

Keep him in there as long as you 

can.


She heads for a pay phone.


MEN'S ROOM


Rick is washing his hands. He looks listless and defeated. 

David stops next to him --


Rick holds up the gun --


RICK

Okay, Uncle David -- I'll sell it to 

you. What d'you say? My sister 'll 

love ya half to death! Hell -- here 

you are!

(handing him the gun)

'Wedding present.


Taken by surprise, David pockets the gun.


RICK

(with a grin)

Happy now?


DAVID

Yup.


RICK

If I need it, will ya give it back?


DAVID

No.


RICK

(lightly)

Don't try an' shit me, Uncle David -- 

You don't give a damn about me.


Rick's mood shifts again -- darkening perceptibly.


RICK

'Hope you guys make it.


He turns and walks to the door.


EXT. MUSEUM


Lori drives the Jeep up to David and Rick. She and David 

exchange a look --


LORI

I've got to see Karen. She's at my 

place.


Rick is preoccupied and pays no attention. He climbs into 

the rear.


INT. LORI'S PLACE


Rick is moving around the room restlessly, playing a few 

notes on his Jew's harp.


RICK

(to Lori)

How long 'we gonna wait? You know 

her -- she'll get here on Judgement 

Day!


Lori is sitting on the window sill, sketching and keeping an 

eye on the street, one floor below.


LORI

Rick, I'm taking you to a doctor.


RICK

Oh yeah?


He picks up the phone and dials the operator --


RICK

(into the receiver)

Hey, operator -- gimme the nut house! 

'Course it's a sick joke -- I'm sick!


He hangs up and walks to the window, passing his fingers 

over his lips to make a babbling sound. When he stops next 

to Lori, something outside catches his attention.


Down below, on the far side of the street, a city ambulance 

has pulled up and two attendants climb out.


RICK

What's that?!


Lori looks at him gravely and puts her hand on his arm --


LORI

I called a hospital, Ricky.


RICK

You what?! You gotta be kidding!

(totally panicked)

I ain't goin' nowhere!


He bounds away, then returns to the window, frantic.


LORI

Rick, it's the only way.


RICK

If you think you're lockin' me up, 

you're the one who's crazy!


On the street below, a squad car has pulled up --


RICK

You called the cops!


David has joined them --


DAVID

(quietly)

They always send them.


RICK

(like a trapped animal)

I ain't goin' no place -- no place.

(to David)

Gimme my gun!


DAVID

It's in the Jeep.


RICK

Fuck you, David! I trusted you!


DAVID

Rick, you need help. You really do!


He moves toward Rick --


RICK

Stay away from me!


DAVID

You'll be okay.


RICK

Like hell!


He tackles David, but after a short struggle, David subdues 

him, and holds him in a kind of embrace --


DAVID

You'll be okay. I know you will.


Rick tears himself free --


RICK

Fuck you!


He picks up his windbreaker and pulls out another gun --


RICK

(backing away)

Okay -- now stay where you are -- 

Don't try nothin'!


Lori and David are stunned --


DAVID

Rick -- give me that.


RICK

Get out-a here -- both-a you! An' 

tell those shitheads -- first one 

through the door gets his head blown 

off!

(yelling out of the 

window)

Hey, you mothers! Don' try comin up!


The attendants are taking some gear out of the ambulance. 

They spot Rick with the gun and take cover. So does the 

officer who has left the squad car.


LORI

(very tense)

Don't shoot, Rick!


RICK

'Ya think I'm bluffing?!


Before she can answer, he takes a shot at the ambulance.


Lori is moving toward him. She tries to keep her voice level --


LORI

That's it, Rick!


RICK

(panicked)

I warn you -- stay where you are!

(backing away from 

her)

You asked for it, Lori!


David tries to hold Lori back, but she pulls away from him.


RICK

(backing away, 

hysterical)

Don't push me!


LORI

Go ahead.


He fires into the room, but away from Lori and David.


LORI

(frantic)

Ricky, please! It's not too late!


Sirens approach from several directions. Rick moves back to 

the window, taking care not to present a target.


Below, several patrol cars are pulling up.


RICK

You must-a called a lot-a hospitals!


He takes a shot at one of the cars and ducks.


LORI

They'll kill you, Rick!


RICK

That's okay -- Say hello to Kare for 

me.


He puts the pistol down on the table, opens a can of paint, 

dips his finger into it, and marks his forehead with a blue 

X.


Both David and Lori see the opening --


LORI

(moving toward the 

table)

Rick, if you stop right now -- You 

haven't hurt anyone.


She makes a break for the table while David moves to head 

off Rick. But Rick has been waiting for exactly this moment. 

He leaps forward with a yell, evades David, and gets to the 

pistol ahead of her.


Lori cries out in rage and despair --


LORI

He wants to get killed! Ricky -- 

please! -- whatever I did -- I'm 

sorry -- I'm truly sorry! I'll make 

it up to you! Please!


His response is to take another pointless shot out the window.


Lori stops. He isn't listening. She knows it's hopeless --


LORI

(a forced calm)

Okay, Rick -- go ahead. Go on.

(she walks to the 

door)

Just wait till I'm gone. I don't 

want to see it.


She pushes David toward the door.


RICK

Get out! Go on -- get her out!

(throwing and kicking 

things after her and 

David)

Get out!


He slams the door shut behind them.


HALLWAY AND STAIRS


Lori is going down the stairs, with David behind her.


Up on the landing, Rick tears open the apartment door --


RICK

(yelling after them)

I wan'a get burned, like Mom! 'Ya 

hear me?!


Lori neither stops nor turns.


STREET IN FRONT OF LORI'S HOUSE


The building is in a state of siege. Both ends of the street 

have been blocked off by patrol cars, and a small army of 

men is using them for cover.


An officer addresses Rick through a battery-powered bullhorn --


OFFICER

I repeat: You will not be harmed! 

We're not here to harm you!


Lori and David come out of the house. An ambulance arrives. 

Lori starts across the no-man's land between the building 

and the police cars.


The commanding officer speaks to her through a PA system on 

the roof of his cruiser --


CAPTAIN

Stay where you are! I'm talking to 

you, miss. Please stay where you 

are!


Lori continues walking toward his car. David catches up with 

her.


RICK

(yelling down)

Hello, Mother -- are you there?


He fires into the air.


CAPTAIN

(opening the door for 

them angrily)

Get in!


LORI

(to the Captain)

Please don't shoot -- he's sick, 

he's completely crazy --


She and David get into the back. The Captain is talking on 

his intercom.


Up on the roof of the building, several men are deploying. 

Two of them enter the wooden shed housing the stairway.


CAPTAIN

You know him?


Lori is in tears. She nods --


CAPTAIN

(to Lori)

'Want to talk to him?


He offers her the microphone.


LORI

It's useless!

(but she takes it and 

speaks into it)

Rick --


Her voice breaks and she stops.


The captain leaves the car. A moment later, a shrill whistle 

blows and tear-gas canisters are fired into the apartment. 

We see Rick toss one of them back, but a thick fog of gas 

forces him out onto the ledge. He is coughing.


Lori hides her face against the back of the seat. David puts 

his arm around her.


There is a brief lull outside. Then Rick suddenly starts 

firing into the room. The men from the roof are evidently 

breaking down the door.


There is a single sharp rifle report from the street. Rick 

topples down from the first floor. His body disappears behind 

a car, so we don't see it strike the pavement.


LORI

(unnaturally controlled)

Is that it?


David nods.


LORI

(her eyes closed)

Is it?


DAVID

Yes.


She gets out of the car.


The street emerges from the frozen tension of the siege into 

bustling activity. There are policemen everywhere.


Lori walks away, past the sharpshooter who brought Rick down. 

He is disassembling his telescopic rifle on the roof of a 

cruiser.


A city ambulance moves toward the spot where Rick lies. 

Someone has covered him with newspapers.


COASTAL HIGHWAY


David is driving. Lori is staring at the sun. It is large 

and red in the afternoon haze. As we approach a hill, the 

sun seems to drop out of the sky in a steep arc and disappears 

behind the ascending slope as though it were setting rapidly. 

Once we have passed the hill and the horizon levels off, the 

sun reappears and rises into the sky.


DAVID'S KITCHEN (EARLY EVENING)


David is scrambling eggs. Through the window, we see Lori on 

the lawn. She is standing in the twilight, her back turned 

to us. The glass through which we see her is covered with 

fluttering moths, drawn by the light.


David puts the frying pan on the table. Lori enters, but 

stops at the door --


LORI

It's easy to make it. You just feel 

nothing.


She sits down at the table.


LORI

Will you call about the body?


David nods. He serves her the eggs and sits down.


DAVID

(after a moment)

You know it wasn't your fault.


LORI

I know it. But I don't believe it.


DAVID'S BEDROOM


David enters the dark room from the bathroom. Lori is lying 

on the bed. He sits down beside her.


She takes his hand and puts it on her breast, then suddenly 

squeezes his hand with her own.


DAVID

(gently)

Don't.


LORI

(her teeth clenched)

I don't want to turn to stone.


EXT. DAVID'S HOUSE (EARLY MORNING)


We are looking at a large tree from an upstairs window. The 

sun is out and dozens of birds sit in the branches.


We hear the sound of a car. Down in the driveway, a taxi has 

stopped and Karen gets out. She is carrying a bag.


DAVID'S BEDROOM


David is at the window, buttoning his shirt. Lori joins him 

in her nightgown --


LORI

Who is it?


She looks out, but steps back quickly when she sees Karen --


LORI

Get rid of her. Tell her I went to 

L.A.


LIVING ROOM


When David comes down the stairs, Karen is already in the 

house. She looks shaky.


KAREN

Where's Lori?


DAVID

I don't know.


KAREN

You mean, she left you?


DAVID

(not much of a liar)

Uh-huh.


KAREN

Why? You're so nice.


She drifts around the room --


KAREN

I saw it in the paper. Were you there?


David nods.


KAREN

I need to see her! She wasn't at her 

place.


Lori has appeared on the stairs behind Karen --


LORI

Hello, Kare.


KAREN

Hiding, huh?!


Lori nods.


KAREN

Who needs another nut?!


She hugs Lori --


KAREN

Don't worry -- I'm not staying. He 

called on Monday. He seemed okay. He 

told me about my daddy.


INT. CREMATORIUM


The coffin is on a platform up front. Piped-in organ music. 

Lori, Karen, and David are alone in the chapel.


KAREN

(to Lori, in a whisper)

I won't make it if I don't take 

something.


She takes a pill. Tears are running down her cheeks.


KAREN

Under all that crap, he was real 

sweet.


She leans against Lori. Lori holds her.


EXT. CREMATORIUM


David is backing his Jeep out of a parking space. Karen is 

next to him. Lori is in the rear, holding the urn in her 

lap.


KAREN

He said if something happened, I 

should take him where you took Mom. 

I would have called you, but I didn't 

know what he meant.


LORI

'Wouldn't have made any difference.

(she sees something 

off screen)

Shit, no!


A cab has stopped at the entrance to the parking lot, and 

Roy gets out.


KAREN

I called him. Daddies ought to be 

there when their kids get buried.


LORI

(to David)

Let's go.


David puts the Jeep into forward --


KAREN

I want to talk to him!


LORI

(to David)

Keep going.


Roy is walking up the middle of the driveway. He doesn't 

seem to be aware of them. David swings around him and out of 

the parking lot.


WATERFRONT, DAVID'S HOUSE (LATE AFTERNOON)


Lori and David are sitting at the end of the dock.


They stop talking when Karen comes out to join them.


KAREN

(lightly)

'Talking about me?


DAVID

No.


Karen sits down beside Lori.


KAREN

How long can I stay?


LORI

You need to see a doctor, Kare. You're 

on drugs and pregnant.


KAREN

(shaking her head)

I'm not pregnant. I just said that.


Lori gives her a look.


KAREN

I'll be good. I promise.


LAKE


David is in the rowboat, accompanying the women on a swim. 

They are off the stern, swimming side by side.


All around them, the sunset sky is reflected in the calm 

water, turning it red.


EXT. DAVID'S HOUSE (TWILIGHT)


Karen comes out of the house. David is cleaning the barbecue, 

and Lori is sketching with acrylic paint under an outdoor 

lamp.


KAREN

(none too steady on 

her feet)

I wish I was seven and you guys were 

my parents.

(she looks at Lori's 

drawing)

That's real nice. Could we get a 

video?


She steadies herself against the picnic table --


LORI

Where 're those pills?!


KAREN

Gone.


LORI

All right, Kare -- tomorrow morning, 

bright and early, you're going back 

to Fern Hill.


KAREN

(sitting down)

They can't do anything.


LORI

They had you clean till you met that 

scumbag!


Karen is so drowsy, she can't keep her head off the table.


LORI

(to David)

Let's get her to bed.


KAREN

It isn't fair. You've got a friend 

and you don't even need him.


A BEDROOM (NIGHT)


Lori turns on the light and David carries in Karen. She has 

her arms around his neck and imitates the sound of a diesel. 

He puts her down --


KAREN

That was so nice --


Lori starts undressing her --


KAREN

I'm jealous -- Bad, bad jealous -- 

It isn't sex -- I don't even like 

sex.


Lori sits her down on the bed and slips off her shoes.


KAREN

(to David)

Will you be my doctor?


LORI

Okay -- lie down.


KAREN

Stop acting like you're my mommy.


She starts taking off her shirt. Lori helps her --


KAREN

I can do it.


She removes her shirt. There is a large, ugly bruise across 

her mid-section.


LORI

What's that?!


Karen looks at the bruise --


KAREN

I fell.


LORI

(very upset)

Don't tell me he hit you!


KAREN

I had it coming.


LORI

Shit! Lie down.


Karen pulls the pillow off the bed and lies down on the floor --


KAREN

'Gonna sleep right here.


LORI

No, you're not! Get up!


She drags Karen up onto the bed --


LORI

I've had it, Kare!


KAREN

(panicked)

Don't go!


Lori turns off the light.


KAREN

Leave it on!


Lori turns the light back on.


Karen is sitting up --


KAREN

Come here -- please!


Reluctantly, Lori returns to the bed --


LORI

What is it?


KAREN

Don't be mad at me.


LORI

(covering her)

I'm not.


KAREN

You have to sit on the bed.


Lori sits down on the bed. Karen looks at her like a lost 

child --


KAREN

It's like a curse.


Lori caresses her face --


LORI

(without much 

confidence)

You'll be okay.


DAVID'S BEDROOM


David is asleep, Lori awake. He lies behind her and holds 

her in a close embrace. Her hair partly covers his face.


Lori retrieves her hair without waking him. She hears an off-

screen sound and bolts upright --


Karen is standing just a few feet away.


LORI

What're you doing?!


KAREN

'Just wanted to see what you look 

like together.


She walks out.


LIVING ROOM (MORNING)


Lori comes down the stairs.


Karen is shaving her legs with a single-edged razor blade. 

She looks up at Lori --


KAREN

You don't have to say it -- I'm gone.


She puts the razor blade into her pocketbook next to her 

packed bag.


KAREN

I called Vinnie.


LORI

You're not going back!


David has come down the stairs.


KAREN

(turning to him)

How do I get a cab?


When he doesn't answer, she heads for the phone and dials 

the operator. Lori disconnects her --


LORI

You're going to Fern Hill. It's all 

set. We called them.


KAREN

You can't make me.


Lori looks at her grimly --


LORI

Okay, Karen -- if that's what you 

want, fine!

(to David)

Call a cab. Shit, no! I'll do it. 

She's my sister.


She opens the phone book and looks for a cab company.


Lori's change in attitude has had a strong effect on Karen --


KAREN

Rehab won't help me.


LORI

Right! What you need is for that guy 

to beat you up! I tell you, Kare -- 

if you walk out of here, that'll be 

the last time you see me. Ever!


She has found a number and starts dialing --


KAREN

Okay, Lori -- I'll go with you.


LORI

No, you won't. You don't want to get 

well.


KAREN

Yes, I do!


Lori looks at her, then hangs up --


LORI

Okay. But this is it! If you pull 

anything else -- anything! -- I'll 

cut you loose.


Karen nods.


LORI

(to David)

Let's go.


EXT. GAS STATION


David pulls in at the self-service pumps. Karen climbs out 

of the Jeep and heads for the office.


GAS STATION OFFICE


Karen has bought an ice-cream sandwich at the vending machine. 

Licking it, she stops in front of the teenage boy behind the 

counter --


KAREN

'Got a ladies room?


The boy hands her a key. She keeps staring at him, and he 

becomes confused. Karen smiles at him.


Lori has come in --


KAREN

I have to call Vinnie. He's waiting 

for me.


She heads out.


EXT. GAS STATION


David has finished pumping gas and drives the Jeep over to 

the telephone booth. Karen is talking inside.


She steps out, but without hanging up --


KAREN

(to Lori)

He wants to talk to you.


LORI

Hang up, Karen!


KAREN

It's Daddy!


LORI

(sharply)

Hang up and get in the car!


Karen goes back into the booth without closing the door --


KAREN

Sorry, Roy -- she doesn't like you 

anymore.

(to Lori)

He says they're moving to St. Louis.

(into the receiver)

'Get away from it all -- right?


She hangs up, walks to the edge of the road that skirts the 

station, and tosses her ice cream under the wheels of a 

passing truck. Then she takes her pocketbook out of the Jeep --


KAREN

I gotta pee.


She heads for the ladies room around the corner.


Lori sits frozen for a moment. She is at the end of her rope.


LORI

Let's just pick her up and take her!


She gets out of the Jeep and heads for the ladies room.


Lori knocks at the door --


LORI

Kare -- it's me.


There is no response and she knocks again --


LORI

Open up!

(to David)

She's got a razor blade.


She tries the door again and it swings open. The room is 

empty.


LORI

Oh Jesus!


They look around the area but Karen is nowhere in sight. 

Heavy traffic in back of the station.


LORI

What now?!


DAVID

(firmly)

Home! You've done what you can.


Lori looks lost.


David puts his arm around her and takes her to the Jeep. She 

lets herself be led, but stops before getting in and pushes 

his hand away.


EXT. BLUE DORY MOTEL, NEW HAMPSHIRE


The buildings face a spectacular view of New Hampshire 

scenery, but they are cheap-looking and set in the midst of 

a tourist strip. It is raining.


Vince is using a power saw on the patio in front of the 

office. He turns it off when he sees David and Lori drive 

up. If he is surprised, he doesn't show it.


LORI

Did Karen call?


VINCE

Like five times! She said she was 

comin'. I told her forget it!


He turns the saw back on.


LORI

(to David)

Park out of sight.


She heads for the motel office.


MOTEL OFFICE


Lori is in the lounge area, watching David, who is on the 

phone at the reception desk --


DAVID

White dress. No -- sandals. Thanks. 

We're at the Blue Dory, Route 6. 

Right.


He hangs up.


Lori is going through Karen's bag. She takes out a bathing 

suit, a half-empty bottle of wine, and her own acrylic paints.


Vince has come in from outside.


Lori finds a bottle with some pills. She looks at him and 

slams it on the counter --


LORI

I know where she gets the stuff!


Vince shrugs.


The phone is ringing and Vince's brother, a heavy-set man in 

his thirties, emerges from the back room.


BROTHER

(answering the phone)

Blue Dory -- I can't hear ya!

(to Vince)

Her again!


Lori has crossed to the desk and picks up the receiver before 

Vince can. But she changes her mind and hands it to him --


LORI

(in a tense whisper)

Tell her to come here!


Vince is reluctant to talk to Karen, but intimidated by Lori.


VINCE

'lo. Where are you? Jus' tell me 

where you are, I'll pick you up. 

Yeah, she's here --


Lori is emphatically shaking her head NO, but it's too late. 

He shrugs and hands her the receiver --


LORI

Hi, Kare. Cool it, will you?! No! 

You won't be locked up! You don't 

have to see anyone you don't want 

to. Karen, don't hang up!


But Karen has hung up. Lori puts down the receiver, very 

upset --


LORI

(to Vince)

'She say where she is?


VINCE

Bus depot. Portsmouth, I guess.


LORI

Get yourself down there, and don't 

come back without her!


VINCE

I don't wan' her here!


LORI

(with barely contained 

rage)

Just go, will you!?


Vince glances at his brother and leaves.


LORI

I want a room.


Vince's brother takes a moment before he places the 

registration pad in front of her.


MOTEL ROOM


Through the picture window, we see a view of the mountains. 

The rain has stopped.


Lori enters the frame. She is using her acrylics to trace an 

outline of the landscape onto the glass.


Off screen, David is on the phone --


DAVID

Thanks a lot. We appreciate it.


He hangs up.


LORI

Nothing, huh?


David enters the frame, shaking his head.


LORI

I wish I could pray.


Her brush strokes on the glass become angry, jagged.


David touches her hand, but she pulls away --


LORI

If you think you're helping, you're 

fucking me up.

(she looks at him)

I'm sorry. If it weren't for you, I 

don't know where I'd be.


She turns to the window and paints a large red sun into the 

sky.


MOTEL POOL (TWILIGHT)


David is sitting at the pool's edge, watching Lori swim. She 

wears Karen's bathing suit.


Vince drives past in the motel pick up. He stops in front of 

the office and gets out.


David goes over to speak to him. Lori watches from the pool. 

Vince shakes his head.


MOTEL ROOM (NIGHT)


Lori enters ahead of David. She is wearing a shirt over the 

bathing suit.


LORI

(unbuttoning her shirt)

Let's go to bed.


She pours herself some wine from Karen's bottle --


LORI

Don't look at me like that!


DAVID

Like what?


LORI

Like you're bleeding.


DAVID

How am I supposed to feel?! You're 

going through hell!


She approaches him --


LORI

You like helpless people, don't you?


DAVID

Come on, Lori -- cut it out!


LORI

Whatever they had, it's catching.

(she looks at him)

If there were such a thing as 

eternity, I'd spend it with you. I 

would!


She turns away.


EXT. MOTEL BALCONY (MORNING)


The door to the room is ajar and Lori comes out.


Below, she sees David and Vince talking to a state trooper 

in a patrol car.


She starts down. David meets her at the foot of the stairs --


LORI

(unnaturally calm)

'Dead?


DAVID

No. They got her at the hospital.


LORI

(flatly)

How bad?


DAVID

He doesn't know.


Lori walks over to Vince --


LORI

(tensely)

Let's go, Vince. Vinnie!


Vince shakes his head --


LORI

What's the matter -- can't take it?!


She heads for the motel van. David joins her.


HOSPITAL PARKING LOT


The van pulls up. Vince is driving.


INT. VAN


Lori and David are in the rear seat --


DAVID

Let me go, okay?


LORI

I'm coming!


DAVID

(restraining her)

You don't have to put yourself through 

that!


She tears free --


LORI

It can't be as bad as I imagine.


HOSPITAL ROOM


Lori enters ahead of Vince. She stops --


Karen is the only patient in a room with four beds. She is 

sitting in a chair near the window, with her back to us.


Lori is enormously relieved to see her sitting up --


LORI

Hello, Kare --


Karen neither turns nor moves.


Lori approaches and puts her hand on Karen's shoulder --


LORI

(gently)

Hi.


Karen's arm is bandaged and one side of her face is scraped, 

but otherwise she seems unhurt.


Lori kisses her, crying with relief --


LORI

Kare, you had me so scared!


Karen doesn't respond. Her eyes are vacant and her face is 

without expression.


LORI

(touching her)

Kare, it's me.


David has come in and stops beside Vince.


LORI

(turning to him)

What's the matter with her?


David joins her --


LORI

Feel her skin! Tell them to put up 

the heat. She's cold. What did they 

say?


DAVID

'Could be shock.


LORI

Will she get better?


DAVID

Sure.


LORI

How long? Days, or what?!


DAVID

They don't know.


Lori is caressing Karen's face --


LORI

Poor Kare -- poor kid --


She turns away to steady herself.


LORI

(to David)

Give me a minute.


David leaves. Vince is already gone.


HOSPITAL PARKING LOT


Lori comes out of the building. David joins her. She seems 

calmer.


LORI

She's alive. That's something, isn't 

it?


She turns to Vince, who is seated in the van --


LORI

'Like her this way?


Vince looks at her sullenly, but says nothing.


LORI

She can't talk or move, but you can 

still fuck her.


DAVID

(taking her arm)

Let's go --


LORI

I know what I can do --


She gets into the van.


INT. CATHOLIC CHURCH


Lori is in front of the altar. After a long moment on her 

knees, she stands up and turns to David --


LORI

(shaking her head)

I can't!


She stops in front of a large crucifix --


LORI

What's wrong with us?


She looks at the crucifix, then turns back to David with 

sudden vehemence --


LORI

I'd rather pray to you! 'Makes more 

sense --


Before he can stop her, she is on her knees in front of him. 

David picks her up. She starts kissing him and putting his 

hands on her body --


DAVID

Stop it, Lori!


LORI

(fiercely)

Why!? It's holy!

(desperately)

If there's someone up there, I'm 

glad they crucified him!

(she stops, frightened)

Listen to me!

(pushing him away)

I'm radioactive. Get out before I 

hurt you!


DAVID

(trying to calm her)

You won't.


LORI

You're not tied to me. You're not my 

family.


She looks at him. She knows he won't leave her, and turns 

away.


EXT. MOTEL (LATE AFTERNOON)


Vince lets David and Lori out of the van, and parks in front 

of the office.


LORI

Could you get me some Midol? There's 

a convenience store down the road.


David looks at her. She seems calm.


LORI

I'll be in the room.


She heads for the office.


David gets into his Jeep, but doesn't start it right away.


MOTEL OFFICE


The office is empty. Music from the back.


Lori walks up to the desk and Vince appears --


LORI

My key.


He hands it to her.


She glances through the window to the parking lot, and sees 

David take off in the Jeep.


Lori puts down the key --


LORI

Take me to the bus.


VINCE

Get your friend to take you.


LORI

He's gone.


Vince hesitates a moment, then calls to the rear --


VINCE

'Be right back.


INT. VAN


We are driving into the sun. There is a blinding glare on 

the windshield and the van is filled with yellow-orange light. 

The radio is on.


Lori is sitting up front, but away from Vince.


He glances at her --


VINCE

'You know why I hit her?


LORI

You were helping her, right?!


VINCE

Yeah. I'm dumb -- like you 'been 

tellin' her from the start! I found 

her in bed with a fourteen-year-old 

kid.


Lori says nothing.


INT. LORI'S PLACE (EARLY MORNING)


The front door, newly installed, is unlocked from outside.


The super is out in the hall and hands Lori a set of keys.


LORI

Thanks.


She enters and closes the door. The place is a shambles.


After a moment, she crosses to the kitchen and turns on one 

of the burners. She watches the gas ignite, shuts it off, 

and blows out the pilot light. Then she opens all four burners 

wide. The escaping gas makes an audible hiss.


The answering machine is blinking and Lori turns it on --


DAVID'S VOICE

Lori, if you're there, please pick 

up!

(the machine beeps 

and David's voice 

comes on again)

I'm at my house now. If you're there, 

please pick up!


She turns off the machine and dials the phone. She doesn't 

like the smell of the gas and wrinkles her nose.


While waiting for someone to answer, she opens the can of 

paints and writes "David, Love, and Thanks" on the tabletop.


LORI

Helen, it's me. Is Roy there? It's 

not important.


She hangs up and stands motionless for a moment. Then she 

walks over to the foam-rubber mattress and lies down. She 

looks up at the ceiling and waits for the gas to take over.


A long silence.


There is a knock at the door --


DAVID'S VOICE

Lori!


She sits up with a start and rubs her face.


DAVID'S VOICE

The super said you're there!


Lori tries to collect herself. She knows he will soon smell 

the gas --


LORI

Just a minute. I'm in the bathroom.


Quickly and efficiently she undoes her preparations for dying. 

She turns off the gas, opens the window, and steps into the 

bathroom to flush the toilet.


She sniffs. The smell of the gas is so strong that she returns 

to the stove, turns on one burner, and places a kettle over 

the escaping gas. Then she opens the door for David.


He looks haggard and angry --


DAVID

That was shitty!


LORI

I'm sorry.


He smells the gas --


DAVID

(pushing past her)

What're you doing?!


Lori pretends to sniff the gas for the first time -- putting 

on a good performance.


LORI

I put the kettle on -- maybe the 

pilot is out.


David has spotted the open burner and shuts it off. The pilot 

is out and her alibi is perfect, but he looks at her with 

grave doubt.


She remembers the message she left for him, and walks to the 

table to smudge it. Then she looks at him, smiles, and shrugs.


DAVID

I called. Where were you?


LORI

In the coffee shop. I didn't want to 

stay here in the dark.

(she stops in front 

of him)

I'm glad you came. I am.


She means it. He looks at her with relief and tenderness.


LORI

(moved by his feelings 

for her)

You know -- you're the one who's 

crazy!


The phone rings.


LORI

Let it ring.


She changes her mind and picks up the receiver --


LORI

Hello --

(flatly)

Nothing. I changed my mind. Yeah, 

Karen told me. She's sick, Roy. Yes, 

very! What d'you expect!? No way! 

There's nothing to say.


She has become very agitated, though she manages to keep her 

voice under control --


LORI

(flatly)

Okay -- where? Okay.


She hangs up.


DAVID

Should you be seeing him?


LORI

They're moving to Missouri. I'll be 

okay if you come.


EXT. MUSEUM


Lori and David drive up.


Roy has been waiting for them. He comes down the steps.


ROY

Thank you for coming.


Lori avoids looking at him.


ROY

Could we go somewhere?


LORI

Here's good enough.


To give them privacy, David gets out of the Jeep and moves a 

short distance away.


ROY

'Mind if I sit down?


Lori lets him into the back of the Jeep by moving her seat 

forward. As he gets in, his foot kicks against something and 

he stoops to pick up the urn with Rick's ashes.


LORI

(flatly)

Give it to me.


He hands her the urn.


LORI

Say what you have to say!


ROY

I want to pay for Karen. School or 

whatever.

(taking a check out 

of his shirt pocket)

I'll send the same every month.


He passes the check to Lori, but she doesn't take it. She 

honks to get David's attention and he returns to the Jeep.


Lori holds up the urn for David to see --


LORI

'Got to take care of Rick. It's been 

banging around your car.

(she turns to Roy)

Good-bye.


ROY

I'm coming.


She looks at him for a moment and shrugs.


David glances from father to daughter. He gets into the 

driver's seat.


NORTH SHORE YACHT BASIN (LATE AFTERNOON; GREY SKY)


David stops the Jeep at the end of the dock. Lori climbs out 

with the urn.


LORI

(to David)

Call him, will you?


She walks down the dock.


David heads for the office shed.


DOCK


Chris is docking his boat.


Lori approaches, surprised to see him.


LORI

Hi -- David just went to call you. 

We need to go out.


Chris has seen the urn --


CHRIS

Okay.


She fastens the bow line for him --


LORI

Tell him, will you? He's at the 

office.


CHRIS

(jumping ashore)

Sure.


LORI

Thanks.


Roy has joined her. She moves away from him and jumps aboard.


LORI

If you're coming, let's go.


ROY

What about your friend?


LORI

I can handle it.


She loosens the bow line.


Roy comes aboard. He isn't agile and almost slips.


BOAT


We are heading out to sea before a steady breeze.


Roy is at the rudder. Lori trims the main sail.


Once the boat moves smoothly, she picks up the urn and sits 

down at the stern.


Roy is watching her. She opens the box, but suddenly thrusts 

it at him --


LORI

You do it! Go ahead!


Roy takes it, anxious to do anything that will lessen his 

guilt in her eyes, and scatters the ashes into the water.


He finds the ring --


ROY

I didn't know he was married.


Lori takes the ring from him and drops it into the sea.


Roy looks at her. The wind is tossing her hair. Her face has 

a harsh beauty.


Another boat has left the dock and is following in our wake. 

We recognize David and Chris.


ROY

I know you blame me for a lot of it.


LORI

(fiercely)

Don't talk!


ROY

Lori, he was sick. So's Karen --


She gets up to move away --


ROY

(reaching for her)

Lori --


LORI

Stay where you are!


Unable to bear his presence, she steps onto the seat and 

dives into the sea --


ROY

(frightened)

Lori!


She is swimming away from the boat toward open water.


ROY

Lori!


David and Chris have seen what happened. David is shouting 

to Roy, but his words are lost in the waves and wind.


Roy tries to shift the boat in Lori's direction, but can't 

handle it. The boat veers and begins to list.


Lori reaches a clanging bell buoy. She hangs onto it and 

looks back.


In a water-level shot from her point of view, we see the 

boat capsize.


Roy emerges unhurt. He swims toward Lori and the buoy.


The crest of a wave hides him from view. When it subsides, 

he has disappeared. He resurfaces, struggling to stay afloat, 

but goes down a second time when the next wave crests.


Lori is watching. The sea washes over her. She makes no move 

toward him.


When the wave subsides, Roy is back on the surface, fighting 

for his life.


Lori stares at him for a moment. Then she pushes off from 

the buoy and reaches him just as he is about to go under. 

She supports him until David and Chris arrive in the boat.


Chris lowers the sail, and David jumps in to help get Roy 

aboard. Chris pulls him up onto the deck while David helps 

Lori.


LORI

I'm okay --

(to Chris)

Get him warm, will you?


Chris takes Roy down into the cabin.


Lori has slumped onto a seat, exhausted and shivering. David 

puts a blanket around her --


LORI

Did you see?


David nods.


LORI

I almost let him die.


David puts his arm around her shoulder --


DAVID

You didn't, though. Chris has come 

up from below --


LORI

Is he okay?


CHRIS

Yeah.


LORI

What about your boat?


DAVID

We'll get it later.


Chris raises the sail.


Low on the horizon, the setting sun drops out of a curtain 

of clouds.


David is watching Lori. Her face is tinged red by the sun. 

It has a strange, transfigured look.


LORI

I'm glad to be alive. I am!


A bell buoy rings. The wind slaps the sail.


The boat tacks, turning David and Lori into a silhouette. 

His arm is still around her, fusing them into a single shape 

against the sky.
