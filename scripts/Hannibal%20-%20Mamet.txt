HANNIBAL


Screenplay by David Mamet


From the novel by Thomas Harris


September 8, 1999


INT. MIDWIVES OFFICE - DAY.


Fairly rundown office.  Old and dirty health notices tacked 

to a bulletin board.  "Common Sense For Nursing Mothers," et 

cetera.


A lower-class woman, pregnant, with a small child in tow, 

opens the door, and enters.  She is sweltering, and mops her 

brow as she walks to the registration desk.


MOTHER

It's hotter inside than it is 

outside... With the air conditioning.


REGISTRAR

Would you sign in here, please..?  

You know, we're closing in half an...


MOTHER

I just came to drop off my payment...


She drops an envelope on the desk.


As she leaves we see the door open, and the dreary suburban 

sprawl parking lot behind.  Camera pans her past Clarice 

Starling, who is sitting, very hot and pregnant, on a bench.  

The Mother exits, and Evelda Drumgo, a very beautiful african 

american woman, holding a newborn, enters.  She looks around, 

goes to the Registrar, and signs in.


REGISTRAR

...That'll just be a minute.


Drumgo sits, she and Starling exchange a look.


Beat.


STARLING

S'hotter inside than it is outside... 

Even with the air conditioning.

(she looks at her 

watch, then up at 

the wallclock.)


DRUMGO

You nervous...?


STARLING

Evone tells me:  I shoulda been in, 

fi, six, months ago... Thizz my first 

checkup.


DRUMGO

Gonna be fine.  You ask your momma.


Starling mutters.


DRUMGO

...What...?


STARLING

...I didn't realize I said it out 

loud.


DRUMGO

Said what?


STARLING

I'm an orphan.


DRUMGO

Well, then, you're a lucky girl, 

cause that baby's gone to be your 

family.

(to the receptionist)

...I've got an appointment...


The receptionist is gone, Drumgo goes to peer over the 

reception desk.


ANGLE ON STARLING


STARLING

That is a lovely thing to say.


DRUMGO

Waal...


STARLING

It gets, um... It gets so lonely 

sometime.


DRUMGO

(sits.  Comforts the 

Child)

What'd you say, hon...?


STARLING

I said sometime it gets so...


DRUMGO

Well, don't you worry, cause that 

baby's gone take care of that.


She brushes back the hair from the side of her face.


ANGLE INSERT.


On a barrette in her hair.  Which we see bears a small 

microphone.


ANGLE ON STARLING, AS SHE HITCHES HERSELF UP IN HER SEAT, AS 

IF TO FIND A COMFORTABLE POSITION.


ANGLE INSERT.


On the back of her dress.  Where we see the print of a square 

box, as Starling's hand manipulate a small knot through the 

dress.  Next to it we see the print of a pistol under the 

dress.


ANGLE ON STARLING AND DRUMGO.


Starling, as she fiddles with the barrette once again.


STARLING

I wonder if you could just, sit down, 

talk with me a moment...


ANGLE XCU ON STARLING, HOLDING THE BARRETTE, AS SHE SPEAKS 

TO DRUMGO.


STARLING

Cause, you know, I'm sitting here 

all alone.  Do you know what I mean?

(pause)

Cause I feel it's getting late for 

me... Do you know...?  That I've 

waited too long...


ANGLE ON DRUMGO, AS SHE STANDS IN THE EMPTY RECEPTION AREA, 

AND LOOKS AT IT AND THEN BACK TO STARLING.


DRUMGO

(pause)

Waited too long, hon...?

(pause)

(she looks at Starling)


STARLING

How's your Child?


Starling stands, and moves to look out of the window.


ANGLE XCU ON DRUMGO, AS SHE LOOKS AT STARLING.


ANGLE, HER POV


The dress, stuck by sweat, to Starling's back, reveals the 

pistol and transmitter.


ANGLE ON STARLING, AS SHE SITS DOWN AGAIN.


DRUMGO

...What?


STARLING

I said how's your baby...?


DRUMGO

You want to hold him...?


STARLING

Waal...


DRUMGO

'bout time you learned...


She hands the baby to Starling.


She goes into the Child's diaperbag and takes out a pistol, 

and levels it at Starling, as she moves to look out the 

window.


DRUMGO

...Where's your friends...?


She moves to Starling, and frisks her, and removes her pistol, 

and the transmitter from the belt at her back...


DRUMGO

...You're here all by yourself, 

honey...


STARLING

Give it up, Evelda.


DRUMGO

Well, you know my name, honey, but I 

don't know yours...


STARLING

Give it up.


DRUMGO

Hey, you know, I never thought of 

that...


She starts getting into the Nurses garb.


DRUMGO

Ain't this a picture, though, cause 

you know you ain't the first girl, 

ever got lef, in a position, waiting 

at the doctor's.  You can't trust 

men, Child, don't you know that... 

Old as you are...?


She walks back toward Starling, scoops up her Child, peeks 

out the window, and starts for the door.


DRUMGO

Cause, see, they'll always let you 

down.  Terrible thing, to do to an 

orphan...


She leans back toward Starling, grabs her hair, and pulls 

her back and kisses her on the lips, and retires and exits.


ANGLE ON STARLING, AS SHE LOOKS OUT OF THE WINDOW.  AT A 

CAR, WHICH -


Is in the far end of the parking lot, it accelerates, and 

screeches up to the door, and Evelda, carrying her Child, 

gets in to the still moving car, which starts to take off.


ANGLE EXT THE MIDWIVES CENTER.


Starling, crouching at the door, retrieves a backup weapon 

from her ankle holster.  She emerges from the doorway.


ANGLE


In the parking lot, Drumgo and Child, getting hauled into 

the car.  A figure in the backseat of the car, shooting over 

the roof, apache style, fires at Starling, as the car peals 

out of the parking lot.


Starling takes cover.


Beat.


Starling, alone, walks into the now empty parkinglot.  She 

sits on a low concrete divider.  Hold.  A van pulls in.


Followed by another car, and ten swat clad Cops pile out, 

and approach Starling.


Starling slowly looks up.


STARLING

...Where were you...?

(she looks at her 

watch.)


SWAT OFFICER

(as several other 

Officers move into 

the midwives center.)

...We, we didn't hear the go-ahead.


STARLING

(as she hands him the 

small radio 

transmitter)

Yeah, well, you didn't get it cause 

your radio went dead.  The backup 

plan was, 17.45, You guys are the 

cavalry...


She gets up and walks away from the doorstep, to a sedan, 

which is pulling up.  As she goes, she takes off the fake 

belly she has been wearing.


Another swat Agent takes the radio and looks at it.


SECOND SWAT OFFICER

...What'd you do, sweat it out, short 

out the leads...?  Got a little hot 

in there...?


She flings the fake stomach at him.


SECOND SWAT OFFICER

...What happened to right to life...?

(he laughs)


Starling rounds on him, hits him several times, and throws 

him to the ground.


STARLING

What happened to right to life?  

What happened to right to my life...?  

I'm in there, carrying the mail for 

all you drugstore cowboys, sit'in in 

a van playin with each other's 

velcro...

(the Officer starts 

to get up)

You wanna get up, you wanna get up?  

Here I am...


Two Fbi types get out of the newly arrived sedan.


FBI TYPE

What happened to the girl...?


STARLING

(as she gets into the 

sedan)

Get me out of here...


INT. CONFERENCE ROOM FBI HEADQUARTERS - DAY.


Starling is now dressed in a t-shirt and jeans.  She has 

cleaned herself up.  Krendler, a clean-cut student council 

type around forty is holding forth.  Around the conference 

table are the fatherly jack Crawford, and various other 

politicos.


Krendler gestures at the table, which holds the burnt out 

receiver, the fake "pregnant" stomach worn by Starling, and 

a photo, he holds the photo.  We see it is Drumgo, a 

surveillance photo.


KRENDLER

And you let her get away.


STARLING

Sir, with all due respect...


CRAWFORD

Just a moment.  Starling didn't...


KRENDLER

Well, well, well, well, well, she 

went in there, to apprehend a 

dangerous felon.  Went in there with 

her gun, came out, without the felon, 

without the gun...


Starling starts to speak, and Crawford stills her.


CRAWFORD

I had... One moment, I had an Agent 

in there, waiting for backup from...


KRENDLER

...She couldn't act on her own..?  

Where is the fbi's vaunted initiative, 

where..?


STARLING

Sir:


CRAWFORD

Shut up, Starling...


STARLING

I could have acted on my own.  I was 

told...


CRAWFORD

Starling, I've ordered you to shut...


STARLING

..I was instructed that this was a 

joint task force, the FBI, BATF, and 

the Mayor's special...


KRENDLER

You find something objectionable to 

working in partnership with...


STARLING

Sir, I'm in law enforcement, I was 

out there, dealing with an armed and 

dangerous...


KRENDLER

You were given backup...


STARLING

Then where was it?  I'm sent out 

there... I'm told that the arrest 

must be a joint...


KRENDLER

I'm saying: ...And what's wrong with 

that.


STARLING

And I'm telling you:  you wanna throw 

a birthday party:  every kid gets a 

chance to play, that's fine, but...


KRENDLER

No, I don't get you...


STARLING

Due respect, you don't, sir, your 

precious joint operation.  FBI, AFT, 

DC SWAT, it's alphabet soup, we don't 

have the same radio freqs, we don't...


KRENDLER

Oh, is this your political position, 

you're opposed to joint...


STARLING

I'm opposed to being part, your 

rainbow coalition.  Evelda Drumgo?  

I could of took her down in a snap 

of the fingers-- but-- I'm out there, 

and my rules of engagement...


MAYOR'S REP

The rainbow coalition, what is that, 

excuse me...


KRENDLER

And what are you, our token woman?


STARLING

I don't mind being the token woman, 

what I'm suggesting, send me out 

there with a token man... Who are 

these warriors, your cobbled together 

strike force?  I'm in the room with 

a fugitive felon...


CRAWFORD

Starling...?


STARLING

One moment, and they're at the seven- 

eleven.  They botched the fallback 

plan, they...


KRENDLER

And, fine, alright, and fine... What 

are you doing, this whole time?


STARLING

Sir, I was, as instructed, waiting 

for the arrival of the strike force.

(pause)


CRAWFORD

I think that's...

(he starts to rise, 

and the meeting begins 

to break up)

Starling, I'm sure these gentlemen...


KRENDLER

And how did she get close enough to 

disarm you?


ANGLE TIGHT ON STARLING, AS SHE BEGINS TO EXIT, MUTTERING.


STARLING

...Spend some time on the streets.  

Ask me then...


KRENDLER

Thank you, that's not responsive.  

How did our miss Drumgo get...


ANGLE EXT THE CONFERENCE ROOM.  A CORRIDOR AT FBI HQ.


Various memorabilia in glass cases, glass cases holding 

firearms.  Starling and Crawford exit.  As they do, a group 

of twenty men and women wearing nametags walks by, escorted 

by a Guide.


One good-looking mediterranean type (pazzi) tries to look at 

Starling as the group goes past.


ANGLE CU ON PAZZI.


We see him, and read the nametag.  (C. Pazzi. International 

police academy. Italy).


GUIDE (V.O.)

...A compendium of the bureau's most 

celebrated cases.  Which you have in 

your course study Guide.  Now; this 

afternoon...


ANGLE, ON THE GROUP AS THEY OPEN THEIR BLUE COURSE STUDY 

GUIDE.


Starling and Crawford turn a corner.  Pazzi looking after 

them, he then, reluctantly, turns away, back to the group he 

is part of.


ANGLE ON STARLING AND CRAWFORD, AS THEY DRAW AWAY FROM THE 

CONFERENCE ROOM GROUP.


CRAWFORD

(sotto)

...How'd you let her get that close 

to you...?


In the b.G. We see an Aide come up to Krendler, and hand him 

a file.  Starling waves off Crawford's question.


CRAWFORD (CONT' D)

...How'd she get next to you?


STARLING

(as if tearing off 

the bandaid)

...She gave me her baby.


Krendler, and the aid walk toward Crawford.  The Aide whispers 

something to Krendler.


KRENDLER

(to Crawford)

She threw a punch at a man on the 

team.


CRAWFORD

Well, you know, that happens, on the 

street.


KRENDLER

What is that supposed to mean...?


CRAWFORD

I think its meaning is clear.


KRENDLER

What, you're saying she was 

overwrought.


CRAWFORD

That could be.


KRENDLER

Because that's understandable, 

because.  She blew the raid.


CRAWFORD

She was there, alone, sir, she was 

in a burning building, waiting for 

your folks to come through the wall.  

And...


Starling starts away, in disgust.


KRENDLER

One moment, I'm not done with you...

(to Crawford, as 

Krendler motions his 

Aide to hand him a 

file)

Give him the file...


AIDE

I thought it was going to go down 

the line, to...


KRENDLER

No, no, no, I want the girl to do 

it...


They go into a huddle, and Starling moves away, waiting.


She looks around, and she and we discover she is standing in 

front of the "lechteriana" section of the FBI display.


The Guide is addressing the visiting foreign Cops.


GUIDE

Of the apprehension of Hannibal 

Lechter.  Here we have a wanted 

poster...


As the Guide speaks we cut between Starling, hoping to hear 

her fate, and the men talking about her.


GUIDE (V.O.)

Offered by an unnamed source, three 

million dollars for information 

leading to the apprehension of 

Hannibal Lechter.  It is, of course, 

a bounty poster, the only one of its 

kind, it was never distributed, the 

contact number was disconnected, and 

the trail of the person offering the 

reward was covered so skillfully, 

that...


PAZZI (V.O.)

(in a cultured 

attractive italian 

accent)

...Would you be so kind...?


Starling turns to Pazzi, holding a camera. She hesitates, 

then realizes he wants her to take his photo in front of the 

poster.


STARLING

Yeah, sure.


Pazzi moves in front of the poster.  We see the reflection 

in the glass fronting the poster, and Starling moves to 

eliminate it .


GUIDE (V.O.)

...Of the Hannibal Lechter case.  

Lechter is, as you know, still at 

large.  Here we see the implements 

used in his escape from prison.  If 

you will turn to your course syllabus, 

page...


ANGLE ON STARLING, AND THE GUIDE, BEYOND HER, AS THE STUDENTS


Again take up their blue books, and turn to the page indicated 

by the Guide.


Pazzi comes back to Starling.


She hands him the camera.


PAZZI

...A lovely perfume...


STARLING

Glad you like it.


GUIDE

(he takes us to a 

display of a 

photograph of 

Lechter's hand, which 

shows six fingers, 

and an x-ray, which, 

similarly shows six 

fingers.)

...Of dr. Lechter's left hand.  His 

left hand, which had a sixth, 

vestigial, fully formed sixth finger.  

You would think that a man with a 

mark so easily identifiable, would...


The Guide spots Starling.


GUIDE

...And, speaking of the Lechter case.


The Guide moves, as if to include Starling in the tour.


ANGLE ON STARLING WHO GIVES THE GUIDE THE WAVE OFF.


Starling retreats as the Guide changes gears.


GUIDE

And, speaking of the Lechter case, I 

would like to complete our tour of 

the gallery with three other instances 

of criminals still at large.  To 

complete our tour, and...

(he checks his notes)

Oh, and to complete your course of... 

Study, by...


We see the group of Krendler, Crawford, et all, break up, 

and begin to move toward Starling.  She approaches them, to 

hear their news.


KRENDLER

(to Crawford)

Your girl's a menace.  Here, givver 

this... Getter off the street and 

teach her some humility.

(of the file)


CRAWFORD

(looking at the file)

I don't think so...


KRENDLER

Well, then, you have insufficient 

information.  I'm grateful for this 

opportunity to set you straight.


He leaves Crawford looking at the file, and walks off, toward 

Starling, who looks him in the eye, as he passes.


Hold.


KRENDLER

(to Starling, in 

passing)

Yeah, get on to your sea-daddy, 

Starling.  Old as you are... Ain't 

you ashamed, still lookin' for your 

pappy...?


Starling walks up to Crawford, who is looking at the file.


CRAWFORD

...What has he got against you?


STARLING

Why would you say that?  Because he 

sent me in there to be killed...?

(of file)

What is this...?


CRAWFORD

...What's he got against you?


STARLING

(as she takes the 

file)

(absently)

He once made me an improper 

suggestion.


INT. GYMNASIUM - DAY


John Brigham, a buff and rough and tough marine type, is 

lecturing to a group of recruits.


BRIGHAM

Big man, little man... Fair fight, 

the good big man's gonna win.  But 

we don't mean to send you out there 

to fight fair...


BRIGHAM LOOKS UP.  ANGLE HIS POV.  A DOOR IN THE BACK OF


Small raised bleacher section opens, and Starling comes in, 

holding the file, she looks down toward Brigham.


ANGLE ON BRIGHAM, AS HE NODS AT STARLING, AND THEN RETURNS 

TO


Address his group of students.


BRIGHAM

And, in a gunfight, what just happened 

to the big man?  He's at a 

disadvantage.  Inney?


He moves to the group of students, and approaches a rather 

large young man.


BRIGHAM

Stand up.

(the man does so, and 

takes his place on 

the mat, in front of 

Brigham)

Big man, now, he's just a bigger 

target.  Let's turn it around.  Pull 

your sidearm.

(the young recruit 

takes out a bright 

yellow, obviously 

rubber pistol from 

his holster)


ANGLE ON STARLING, AS SHE PERUSES THE FILE.  SHE SHAKES HER


Head in disgust.  She looks down at Brigham and mouths, "I 

need to see you..."


ANGLE, ON BRIGHAM, ON THE MAT, ADDRESSING THE PUPIL, HE NODS 

BACK, AT STARLING, AND TOUCHES HIS WATCH, AND MIMES, "LATER, 

FOR DRINKS."


BRIGHAM

(to the student)

Now, an arrest?  You aim to shoot 

me, or you just playing show and 

tell.  You don't want to shoot me, 

you just deprived yourself of one of 

your hands.  You fool, I got two 

hands, you got one.  So: what's the 

gun good for?  Force?  No.  It's 

good for control.  You can control 

through force, but you can also 

control through...


ANGLE, ON STARLING, AS SHE EXITS, THROUGH THE BACK OF THE 

GYM.


ANGLE.  HOLD ON BRIGHAM, ADDRESSING THE STUDENT, WHO LOOKS 

OVER HIS SHOULDER TOWARD THE DIRECTION OF BRIGHAM'S GAZE.


BRIGHAM

Misdirection...

(he moves to the 

student and throws 

him to the ground)

Misdirection, my friend.  You're 

pointing a gun at me, looking in the 

other direction, who the hell do you 

think you are...?


ANGLE, ON STARLING, BACK IN THE CORRIDOR, AS SHE OPENS THE 

FILE, AND LOOKS AT IT AGAIN, AND SHAKES HER HEAD.


INT. PSYCHIATRIST'S OFFICE - DAY.


Starling is talking to a middle aged woman.


WOMAN

(psychiatrist)

..That you went into police work to 

control your rage....


Starling starts to laugh.


STARLING

Well, that would be a poor choice, 

wouldn't it...


PSYCHIATRIST

Tell me why...?


STARLING

(shakes her head, 

still laughing)

I'm sorry, I don't mean to be 

impolite.  Because, you know, you 

can't understand.


PSYCHIATRIST

Then tell me.


STARLING

Well, you know, you know, you know, 

the point is:  I can't tell you.  

Cause you haven't been there.  You 

haven't done it.  And that's all 

there is.


PSYCHIATRIST

(pause.  She checks 

her notes)

...And to have done it, means, can 

mean to accept, not only danger, but 

betrayal...?


STARLING

...That's right.


PSYCHIATRIST

..And humiliation?  What is this new 

job they've...?


STARLING

No.  That's right.  That's all part 

of it.


PSYCHIATRIST

Then, that being so, why is today 

special?  Why have you come back to 

see me?  Is it that new file they 

gave you?


STARLING

I don't think so.


PSYCHIATRIST

Then what brings you back?


STARLING

I don't know.  Do you know...?


PSYCHIATRIST

Yes.  I think I do.

(pause.  Starling 

looks at her, as if 

to say, then, please, 

reveal it)

I think it is a phrase you used with 

that woman.  You told her you were 

an orphan.

(starling starts 

shaking her head)

You used, to your mind, your most 

private fears.


STARLING

...No...


PSYCHIATRIST

...You called up memories of your 

father to...


STARLING

...No...


PSYCHIATRIST

...Barter with her.  To appeal to 

her, and you feel that...


STARLING

No, I don't think so...


PSYCHIATRIST

It is you who have betrayed...


STARLING

...No.


PSYCHIATRIST

Your father.  It is not they, who...


STARLING

Well, no...

(she looks at her 

watch)

That's... I appreciate your help, 

but...

(she rises)


INT. COPBAR - NIGHT.


Starling is drinking with Ardelia Mapp, a contemporary, and 

Ardelia's boyfriend, Jim.  There are various empty bottles 

in front of them.


Starling is looking down at the file we saw earlier, and 

scowling.


Mapp and Jim look on.  A waitress comes by.


MAPP

You want another drink, honey...?


STARLING

I want the same drink.  Cause it did 

me good... But I already drunk it, 

so, barring that, yes, I would like 

another.


The waitress exits.


STARLING

B'cause it's one of the few things, 

in the world, which are effective 

an' predictable.


MAPP

What's that, baby?


STARLING

Alcohol.  Where both its life-

enhancing and its life destroying 

qualities...

(sound of cheering, 

they look to the 

side)

...Not unlike some hindu god...


Mapp picks up the file, and looks at it.


MAPP

I guess the only thing is suck it 

up...


STARLING

Well.  Excellent... I'm...


There is a sound of renewed cheering, and heads turn.


ANGLE THEIR POV.


A table of the "international police school" students,


Drinking, and wearing "gimme caps," which are passed out by 

an arriving john Brigham.


ANGLE.


Brigham, being congratulated and thanked by the various 

foreign Cops.


Brigham passes out caps which are blazoned "FBI Academy, 

Quantico, Virginia."


We see Brigham notice Starling, et al, and excuse himself.


One of the foreign Cops calls after him.


FOREIGN COP

Semper fi.


BRIGHAM

...Truer words were never spoken...


Camera takes him to the Starling table, where Starling, drunk, 

is looking through the file.


STARLING

Our mister frendler to, to, to 

humiliate me, though...


MAPP

What else's he goin' to do with his 

day, he can't work, and he won't 

steal...


Brigham sits, and kisses Starling.


STARLING

Oh baby, oh baby...


BRIGHAM

Bad beat today.


STARLING

Hey, I'm fine.  Whaddizit, you, how's 

your day, our gallant international 

neighbors...?


MAPP

Look what they put her on...


She takes the file from Starling and hands it to Brigham.


STARLING

No, that is code-word material, that's 

what that is...


ANGLE ON BRIGHAM AS HE PICKS UP THE FILE. IT CONTAINS


Catalogue from an auction house, and we read:  from a 

collector:  drawings and sketches by Hannibal Lechter:


These never-before offered items were originally in the high-


Security cell of the mass killer... (Etc.)


And, below, we see various architectural sketches.


ANGLE ON STARLING, BRIGHAM, AND SO FORTH.


MAPP

They got her cleaning out the 

privvies.


BRIGHAM

(of the auction 

catalogue)

What does this mean?


MAPP

Slap her wrist, they got her, chasing 

down the auction houses, drawings of 

Mr. Lechter, come up for sale.


BRIGHAM

Why's she chasing'em down...?


MAPP

Find out:  is he selling'em, he needs 

the money, o'r'izzey buying them, 

f'old times sake...


BRIGHAM

That's weak.  The man's long gone, 

he's not coming back, buy up a 

drawing...


STARLING

No, but that is the will of the 

institution.  To instill a proper 

probity, humility, deference, in the 

prideful individual... Could I, does 

anyone think, have another beer...?


JIM

This jackal Krendler, trine a shame 

her, cause they botched the raid.


BRIGHAM

Evelda Drumgo.


STARLING

Could I get a drink,

(to Brigham)

N'I don't care, you see, what all 

they got me doin, for I'd rather be 

doin' makework, than be doin' 

pub'l'relations with the dirty dozen, 

one hispanic, one librarian, one 

jew, and one from column a, and one 

from column...

(a drink is set before 

her, she reaches for 

it.  She looks up.)

Thank you.


Pazzi is bringing her a beer.


PAZZI

An honor.  Carlo Pazzi...


STARLING

No, y'know, I never doubted it...


PAZZI

You were kind enough, today, to take 

my photograph.


STARLING

Well, that's you see, what I am, 

kind and feeling.


MAPP

You should get married.


STARLING

That's what I should do.  Tell me 

why?


MAPP

Because, baby, you're looking to 

find love in an institution, that's 

your only chance...


STARLING

Yeah, but who would marry friendless 

me...

(to Pazzi)

Howabout you, romeo...?


PAZZI

(shows his wedding 

ring)

...Sadly...


STARLING

Hey, lost again.


PAZZI

But perhaps, there is some, some 

less radical solution.


STARLING

I'm sure there is, but my young friend 

here, would kill you.

(she gestures at 

Brigham)


PAZZI

His feelings do him honor.  And I 

have come, simply, to pay my respects 

to the great Clarice Starling...

(he bends over to 

kiss her hand.)


STARLING

The great and beautiful...


PAZZI

Is it necessary to say of the sea 

that it is salt, that the stars are 

far, that...


STARLING

No, I get it, this is my cavalier.  

This gents my italian knight.  Take 

this...

(she removes a scarf 

from her neck and 

hands it to him)

For this shall be my gage, and you 

can take it into battle.


PAZZI

Thank you.


STARLING

Or clear your windshield with it.


PAZZI

(smells the neckerchief)

...What a lovely perfume.


STARLING

Waal, you c'n only get it in one 

shop in Alexandria Virginia, n'that's 

where I'm going, cause I'm goin home, 

f'i can get n'y'one, of that nature, 

to take her there...


BRIGHAM

C'mon, pal.


STARLING

All y'got to do is ask...

(she reaches for her 

purse, and knocks 

the file off of the 

table)


ANGLE INS.


It falls to the floor, we see various auction catalogues, 

and an x-ray of a human hand.  Pazzi stoops and gathers the 

file up.


Brigham takes the file, and Starling takes it from him.


ANGLE IN.


We see a drawing of what appears to be a statuary.  A lion's 

head, the lion holding a bird in its mouth.


ANGLE ON STARLING AS SHE HOLDS THE DRAWING.


STARLING

...This one is my favorite.  It has 

not title.  They should call it 

"Fetch," whaddaya think...?


PAZZI

I know it well.


STARLING

Do you.  What does that mean?


PAZZI

It is a gravestone in the cemetery 

of in my native Florence.


Mapp looks at the pictures in the catalogue.


MAPP

Yeah, we got all sort of "Funeray 

sculpture," here, I guess they mean 

statues in graveyards.  Brazil, the 

tomb of Karl Marx, London, here's 

one in Scandinavia...


PAZZI

Florence, as you may not know, is 

famed for...


STARLING

Yeah, I'm sure it's famed for lotsa 

things, and you're one'a'them...


PAZZI

...But:  this particular statue...


Starling downs a beer, as Brigham bears her away.


STARLING

Waal, you hold fast to that thought, 

as I'm sure, that's a "clue"...


PAZZI

..This is perhaps an inappropriate 

time... But, I would like to say, it 

is an honor to meet the woman who 

solved the celebrated Hannibal 

Lechter...


STARLING

I din't solve it, I didn't 'solve 

it'.  I just sat a dance out with 

him.  Facts, facts, facts.  Facts, 

close the case, cavalier.


PAZZI

...A case, so, so fascinating, so...


Starling surreptitiously signals Brigham that he may remove 

Pazzi.


BRIGHAM

It was all of that, son...


PAZZI

..What makes a man ... What makes 

him...  Eat human flesh...?


STARLING

Yeah, well, they solved that:  turns 

out, he'uz a cannibal...


MAPP

Show'm the FBI handshake...


STARLING

I am no going to show you the secret 

handshake!

(she starts to stand)


BRIGHAM

(as he leads Pazzi 

off)

C'mon, pal, I'm gone to buy you a 

drink...


He walks Pazzi off, stuffing some money in Pazzi's jacket 

pocket.


He leaves Pazzi among his foreign cohorts.


ANGLE ON MAPP, STARLING, AND JIM, AT THEIR TABLE.


MAPP

Yeah, well, it's a raw wound, innit, 

you're gonna bump it, every time you 

turn around... But you know what the 

trick is...?


STARLING

...Not to turn around.


Brigham returns, and starts to lead Starling, through the 

knot of drunken Cops.


In the bg we see Pazzi, at his table, pointing out Starling, 

they turn to look at her, we see one of the foreign cops, 

lean over to ask more information of Pazzi, and, then, turn 

back, to do a double take at the retreating Starling.


ANGLE ON BRIGHAM, HELPING STARLING.


BRIGHAM

You want to get married...?


STARLING

You tol me you wuunt ask me again 

til I'm ready...


BRIGHAM

You're ready now.


STARLING

I'm not.


BRIGHAM

That's what you think...


EXT. STARLING'S APARTMENT BUILDING - NIGHT. 


Brigham and Starling walking up, Starling swaying a little, 

he holds out his hand for the key, and she gives it to him.


STARLING

...Mos kind...


We hear a car coming up the street behind them.


Brigham opens the door.


There is a flash of light from inside the house.  As Starling 

is about to enter.  She pushes Brigham off to the side of 

the door, and unholsters her pistol.


Beat.


Starling looks at Brigham who look uncomprehending.  Another 

car is heard coming up the road, and we see its headlight 

shine on and reflect from a mirror inside Starling's door.


Brigham leads Starling into the house.


He closes the door, and takes her to the sofa.


She sits, and picks up a photograph in an easel frame from 

the coffee table.


STARLING

Hey, now, what was I afraid of... 

I'm shooting at shadows...


BRIGHAM

Is that what you're afraid of...?


ANGLE INS. ON THE PHOTOGRAPH, SHOWS A TALL HANDSOME MAN IN 

WESTERN HAT, WEARING A BADGE, HIS HAND ON THE SHOULDER OF A 

YOUNG BLONDE GIRL.


ANGLE ON STARLING, AS SHE PUTS THE PHOTO DOWN.


STARLING

Then you tell me, then.


BRIGHAM

You want me to solve all your problems 

tonight...?


STARLING

I feel...

(she starts to laugh)

I feel they're out to get me...


BRIGHAM

And who is "they?"


STARLING

...They're sending me.  Out to get 

shot.  Hounding me... They're...

(pause)


BRIGHAM

...The whole world's out to get you...


STARLING

How crazy is that.


BRIGHAM

Well, you wanna shoot back, it give 

you a big target...


STARLING

(sleepily)

How crazy is that...


ANGLE, INS. ON THE LECHTER FILE, AND THE PHOTO OF HANNIBAL 

LECHTER.


We see Brigham put it down on the table next to the photo.


Hold, lights go off.


Beat.  Starling's hand comes into the frame, sweeps the 

Lechter photo and file onto the floor, and replaces it with 

the photo of the western garbed man and the little blonde 

girl.


Beat.


The light goes on again.


We see Starling swing to a sitting position on the couch. -

She sighs.  She shakes her head to clear it, and she pulls 

the Hannibal file to her.  She picks up a pencil, and a pair 

of reading glasses from the table, and begins making notes 

on the file.


ANGLE INS.


The auction catalogue, an FBI file, reading, "Sale of stolen 

Hannibal Lechter material."


EXT. VIRGINIA HIGHWAY - DAY.


Starling's FBI sedan speeding past, on an empty country road.


The car pulls over onto the shoulder.


ANGLE INT THE CAR.


Starling, taking out a map.  She looks at the map.  Looks 

around.  She throws the car into reverse, and reverses several 

hundred yards quickly.


ANGLE INT THE CAR.


Starling looks from the map across the road.


ANGLE HER POV.


A barely discernible break in the foliage, beat, then 

Starling's car pulls across the road, and into the pov and 

enters the break.


ANGLE EXT THE CAR.


Emerging from a thick woods, the car is hinged by the camera 

onto the park of a country estate, the car disappears into a 

small dip in the landscape.


ANGLE EXT THE CAR, AT A GATEHOUSE, PREVIOUSLY HIDDEN BY THE 

CONTOUR OF THE LAND.


We see a small decrepit gatehouse in stone, and, beyond it, 

a flimsy and ancient barricade, an old gamekeeper type in 

tweeds comes out of the guardhouse.  He is carrying a mug of 

coffee and has a napkin tucked into his collar.  He removes 

the napkin and approaches the car.


Starling flashes her credentials to the old man, who holds a 

clipboard.


STARLING

Special Agent Clarice Starling, to 

see Mason Verger.


The man ambles back into the gatehouse.


ANGLE INT THE GATEHOUSE, THE OLD MAN ENTERS, AND CAMERA PULLS 

BACK TO SHOW, IN A ROOM OFF THE MAIN ROOM, THE FIT BODYGUARD 

TYPES, WATCHING STARLING ON A TV MONITOR.


There is a raft of electronic equipment in the room, and a 

rack with several assault rifles on it.  One of the guards 

is typing onto a computer terminal.  He looks at the result, 

and glances up at Starling, on the screen, and nods "okay" 

to the old man.  The old man ambles out to the barrier, having 

picked up an old clipboard at which he squints.


Then, satisfied, he raises the barrier, and Starling's car 

goes through.


EXT. A MAGNIFICENT COUNTRY ESTATE HOUSE


A potato chip van is parked to one side in the wide drive.  

An old retainer holds open the door for Starling, as she 

exits from her sedan, and he shows her into a large open 

morning room, in which we find twenty young Children of 

various races, romping on a selection of new toys.


Camera takes Starling through a modern kitchen, where several 

white uniformed cooks are working happily, one is opening a 

vast tin of potatochips.  One of them is removing a tray of 

cookies from the oven, several tykes wait happily nearby.  

The cook with the tray of cookies gives Starling a wide grin.


The retainer takes Starling past the kitchen, to a double 

door, which he opens to reveal a corridor beyond, and a large 

fit man in his thirties, wearing an orderly's whites, coming 

toward the camera.


CORDELL

Agent Starling, would you come with 

me...?


Cordell bows to the old retainer, who retires.


Cordell and Starling walk down the corridor.


STARLING

The Children...?


CORDELL

...They're from Baltimore....


STARLING

I've never heard that he...


CORDELL

It's not something he wants to 

publicize, ma'am.  It's just something 

he does.


Beat.


STARLING

I won't take much of his time.


CORDELL

He's glad to help. ...It's just a 

question of his physical condition.  

You understand...


Camera takes Starling down a corridor lined with hunting 

prints.  At the end of the corridor an old woman sits in a 

wooden chair, knitting.


They have stopped.  Waiting for the woman to look up.


Starling's gaze is drawn by an old, crewel-work "sampler"


Framed on the wall by the old woman's chair.  And obvious 

antique.  It reads:


"Do not give into adversity.  Do not trust to prosperity."


ANGLE ON CORDELL AND STARLING, AS STARLING LOOKS AT THE 

SAMPLER, AND THE OLD WOMAN LOOKS UP FROM HER KNITTING.


She sits in front of a half-opened door, which we see is the 

door to a linen closet.


CORDELL

...Y'get enough breakfast, Rosie...?


Beat.


XCU ON THE OLD WOMAN, AS SHE LOOKS AT STARLING, AND THEN 

NODS TO CORDELL, AS IF TO SAY, "THAT IS THE CORRECT CODE."


ANGLE INS.


Her hand drops to the back of the wooden chair, and presses 

a button concealed in the leg.


ANGLE THE GROUP IN THE CORRIDOR, THE "LINEN CLOSET," OPENS, 

TO REVEAL, BEYOND IT, WHAT APPEARS TO BE A SURGICAL FACILITY, 

OR HIGH-TECH HOSPITAL ROOM.


INT. THE HIGHTECH ROOM.


There is a Nurse, sitting at a station, monitoring various 

lifesign displays.  She looks up briefly, as Cordell and 

Starling enter.


NURSE

(to Cordell)

Five minutes...


Cordell nods, and takes Starling deeper into the room.  We 

begin to hear the susurrus of a mechanical breathing 

apparatus.  Camera goes with Starling into the room, where 

we see a hospital bed, with a screen in front of it, and 

various television displays above it, Angled to be seen from 

the bed.


Starling approaches the bed, and looks down at the figure in 

it.  We see her face, but the figure is screened.  The figure, 

Verger, speaks breath by breath, with an obvious electronic 

enhancement.


VERGER

Aren't they beautiful, miss 

Starling...


Starling looks up at the Children playing.


ANGLE HER POV.


One of the Children falls off a small plastic slide, and 

cries, a Nurse runs to him.


VERGER

Well, now, you see, one of them's 

hurt.  And what will make it better?  

Love.  Isn't that odd.

(pause)

He think's he's hurt his knee--but 

the assurance, the assurance, the 

assurance that someone cares

(wheeze wheeze)

Suggests the hurt was elsewhere.


STARLING

Mr. Verger, thank you for your time.


VERGER

For the worst hurt, of course, that 

which will not heal, is the conviction 

no one cares.


STARLING

I've come to see you, sir, about an 

auction...


She holds up the catalogue to him.


ANGLE INS "DRAWINGS AND MEMORABILIA RELATING TO THE SERIAL 

KILLER, HANNIBAL LECHTER."


ANGLE ON CORDELL, AS HE COMES CLOSE, DONNING SURGICAL GLOVES, 

AND TAKES THE CATALOGUE, AND HOLDS IT TOWARD VERGER.


VERGER

Ah, yes, ah yes.  Our doctor 

Lechter...  And have they sent you, 

once again to capture him?  How 

terrible for you...


STARLING

No, sir, it's not my job to capt... 

Why do you say how terrible?


VERGER

Because we must leave the past in 

the past.

(Wheeze wheeze)

(cordell turns a page)

Ah.  And here we have artifacts of, 

yes, my own encounter with him...


Cordell turns the page quickly.


VERGER

No, no.  That's alright.  Yes.  

Lechter's drawings of me.  Before... 

And, of course, after... Now:  you 

are not sent to pursue him.  Then 

your visit baffles me.


STARLING

Sir, various drawings, done by Dr.  

Lechter, while in prison, stolen 

from the prison after his escape, 

have surfaced and are being sold at 

auction.  Several large reserve bids 

have been placed on them.  I have to 

ask if you've placed those bids.


VERGER

Because?


STARLING

Because if it was not you, then, 

perhaps it was Dr. Lechter, trying 

to reclaim his own property.


VERGER

And why would you suspect me, of 

this ghoulishness?


STARLING

Because, sir, you are the only one 

of his victims who lived.  And because 

you have large resources.


VERGER

Large resources, Starling, which I 

prefer to devote elsewhere...


Starling looks up, as we see the image on the television 

change to the Children eating the cookies, and the image 

changes again to show a small dispensary, and the knee of 

the child who fell being bandaided by a Nurse.


STARLING

Due respect, sir...


She produces a Copy of the wanted:  Hannibal Lechter poster 

we saw at the FBI.


STARLING

Due respect, after your, after your...


VERGER

My encounter.


STARLING

Someone offered three million dollars 

bounty on Dr. Lechter's head.

(pause)


CORDELL

The identity of the person offering 

the bounty was never established.


VERGER

Yes, but we know who it was, and I 

will tell you, Agent Starling, what 

you know to be true.  I offered the 

bounty.  It was illegal, and, worse, 

it was wrong.  And I thank god every 

day that I did not compound my sinful 

life by the stain of a murder.  Do 

you...

(wheeze)

Agent Starling:  do you know god?

(pause)


STARLING

...Sir...?


VERGER

Isn't it funny?  You can look on my 

face...

(wheeze wheeze)

Which you would grant me, is the 

most hideous sight you will see in 

what I hope is a long life.  You can 

look at me.  Which shows...

(wheeze)

A strength which must come from strong

(wheeze)

strong convictions.

(wheeze)

But you shy when I say the name of 

god.


The Nurse comes up, holding the tape of a lifesigns machine, 

she nods to Cordell and indicates the monitors.


NURSE

(to Starling)

...I'm sorry..

(meaning, you must 

go.)


STARLING

Yes, then, you're saying that you 

haven't bid upon these drawings.


VERGER

I have not, I would not.  For life

(wheeze)

Life goes on Starling.  And, wait, 

wait, I wish to talk to you...  I'm...

(wheeze)

(to the Nurse, who is 

taking Starling's 

arm)

One moment.  I was afflicted, do you 

see, but my affliction was not in my 

meeting with your dr.  Lechter.  I 

was afflicted before.  Before.  Do 

you see?  In my arrogance.  Do not

(wheeze)

Do not curse god when you are 

humiliated.  Listen to me: embrace 

it, and you embrace life...  Listen, 

and you hear the word of god...  Do 

not curse god when you are humiliated.  

Listen to me: embrace it, and you 

embrace life...  Listen, and you 

hear the word of god...


Starling is led away by the concerned Nurse.  Cordell lingers 

behind, at an unseen behest of Verger.


The Nurse starts preparing a hypo at her station.


STARLING

...Will he be alright...?


The Nurse, distracted, nods, and retreats toward Verger with 

the hypo.


Cordell comes out to Starling.


INT. CORRIDOR, COUNTRY HOUSE, - DAY.


Starling and Cordell are walking, beyond them, we see various 

Children playing under adult supervision.  A caretaker type 

is holding a small goat, which the Children are playing with.


Cordell opens the glass door, and he walks Starling through 

the scene of the Children and the goat.


CORDELL

Mr. Verger wanted me to give you 

this...

(he hands her a small 

printed card)

Angle on Starling, as she glances at 

the card.


ANGLE INS THE CARD READS:


"Do not give into adversity..."


She glances at it, and, dismissively, puts it in a pocket.


CORDELL

And he has asked me to ask you 

something.


STARLING

What would that be?


CORDELL

(pause)

He... Would consider it a favor if 

he could make a donation.  To a 

charitable institution of your choice.

(pause)


STARLING

Now, why in the world would he do 

that?


CORDELL

I... Think... He was.... He was 

touched, by your reaction.  To his 

appearance.


STARLING

What reaction?


CORDELL

Exactly.


STARLING

(as she hands him a 

card)

Please, I do not... I don't want to 

trouble him.  But if you or he have 

any notion, who would be buying Dr. 

Lechter's...


CORDELL

Do you know the seller?


STARLING

We've subpoenaed the auction house's 

records.


CORDELL

Try Barney Clark.


STARLING

(taking out a notebook)

He is...?


CORDELL

He was the orderly, during Dr. 

Lechter's stay in prison.


STARLING

And how would you know that?


CORDELL

Before "the change," Mr. Verger was... 

He made quite a study.

(pause.  Starling 

makes a note.  She 

looks around.)


STARLING

You should get the kids a dog...


CORDELL

...I hardly think so... After "the 

incident"...


STARLING

No, no, of course not.


She starts to get into her car.


CORDELL

...Mr. Verger would be pleased to 

make a contribution, to the 

charitable...


STARLING

Tell him to give it to an orphanage.


Starling closes the car door.


Hold.  On Starling, watching the Children for a moment.  

Then she takes the card from her pocket and glances at it.


IT READS:


"Do not give into adversity, do not trust to prosperity.  Be 

aware of fortune's habit--she will do just as she pleases.  

None of this is in your control.  Be happy.  Be kind.


ANGLE ON STARLING,


as she starts to put the car in gear, putting down the note.  

Then she hesitates, and begins to cry.  Lowering her head, 

beyond her we see the potatochip van, parked in the driveway, 

and the Children romping with the goat.


INT. PSYCHIATRIST'S OFFICE - DAY.


Starling is talking to a kindly older woman Psychiatrist.


PSYCHIATRIST

...That you could go beyond the 

institution."


STARLING

Yes.


PSYCHIATRIST

What does that mean?


STARLING

(pause)

I saw a man today, a man so hideously 

deformed who'll spend his life in a 

hospital bed...


PSYCHIATRIST

Yes, so you said.  But what does 

that mean:  to go beyond the 

institution.


STARLING

(takes a tissue from 

a box on the desk)

If he could overcome... His need 

for... For self-ratification...


PSYCHIATRIST

...Would you use a small word?


STARLING

For approval.


PSYCHIATRIST

What's wrong with approval?

(pause)

You admired that man.


STARLING

Yes.


PSYCHIATRIST

How do you think that made him feel?

(after a pause.  She 

checks her notes)

What does that mean, "to go beyond 

the institution...?"

(pause)


STARLING

I told that woman I'm an orphan.


PSYCHIATRIST

...You are an orphan.


STARLING

But... But... But... You're right.  

I used it.  To bargain.  For her 

sympathy...  I used it--to "whore 

myself out"--

(pause)


PSYCHIATRIST

Welcome to the human race.

(starling shakes her 

head in negation.  

Pause)

Do you know, there are people who 

admire you?  Reasonable people.

(pause)

Why don't you find them...?


Pause.  Starling looks up, at the new concept.


INT. FBI HEADQUARTERS - DAY.


Starling, walking down a corridor.  Camera hinges her to 

"Behavioral Science."  She sticks her head in, and asks, of 

an Aide:


STARLING

Y'see john Brigham...?


AIDE

...I...


Crawford sticks his head out of his office, he puts his pipe 

aside, and calls to Starling... She comes in, and he holds 

up an x-ray.


CRAWFORD

Look at this:


STARLING

You seen john Brigham...?


CRAWFORD

This just came in, over the transom.  

Fella, works for a plastic surgeon, 

Argentina.  Look here:


STARLING

...What'm I looking at...?


CRAWFORD

A Fellow with five fingers.


STARLING

...Standard issue...


CRAWFORD

Not for our doctor Lechter.  This...

(he glances at notes)

Purports to be an x-ray of the hand 

of a ...White male... Mmmm... Mmmm..., 

After the removal of a vestigial 

sixth digit.  Left hand.  It purports 

to be the x-ray of Dr. L...


STARLING

Am I on that case, sir...?

(pause)


CRAWFORD

No.

(pause)


STARLING

Well, then--i wouldn't want to be 

taken for a hobbyist...


The Aide comes in, holding a phone.


AIDE

Agent Brigham is in the library.


STARLING

(to Crawford)

Excuse me...

(the Aide and Crawford 

exchange a surprised 

look)


She exits


INT. LIBRARY - DAY


Brigham, in the library, bent over a lawbook.


A note is slipped over the book.  It reads, "Yes, I will 

marry you."


ANGLE ON BRIGHAM, AS HE READS THE NOTE.


BRIGHAM

This isn't signed.


STARLING (V.O.)

Hard up as you are, at your age?  

Whadda you care?  Surrender.


BRIGHAM

Don't shoot, g-men..."


Starling sits down next to him.  Beaming.


BRIGHAM

Why?


Starling smiles and starts to make a pert answer.  She gets 

a bit teary, and Brigham leads her out of the library.


ANGLE, A BALCONY OFF THE LIBRARY.


Starling hands Brigham the card she got from Verger.


STARLING

(as Brigham reads}

You know what, he's right.  Fella:  

had his life taken from him, by a 

maniac.  Fella.  He's laying there, 

he'll never get off that bed.  He 

can't move, a monster...

(She shakes her head, 

and leans into 

Brigham.  Tight two 

shot)

...A monster fed his face to the 

dogs.

(beat)

N'he said that it saved his life.

(she starts to laugh)

He's spend'n his life helping 

children.  How corny is that...?  

But, you know what:  I give up.  

Let's get married and spoil a buncha 

kids...

(they embrace.)


ANGLE INT THE LIBRARY BRIGHAM AND STARLING ENTER, AS HE GOES 

TO GATHER UP HIS MATERIALS.


An Agent hurries through.


AGENT

Starling:  they got a x-ray.  They 

think, they might have a lead on 

Lechter.


STARLING

Wherever he is, that's fine with 

me...


AGENT

They...


STARLING

Yeah, I know.


The Agent looks at her wonderingly, and, then, as if she has 

not understood.


AGENT

(as he produces a 

xerox of an x-ray)

They got a radiologist assistant, 

Buenos Aires, guy, amputation of a 

sixth finger...And it seems to've 

left a scar, uh oh...


STARLING

That ain't my case.  They assigned 

me, go do some legwork, theft of 

government property.  Tha's what I'm 

gonna do, and then go home and burn 

the roast.  How the hell about that--

i'm gonna swim with the current, and 

I don't care where he is.


As Brigham is gathering his stuff, he drops the card Starling 

gave him, on the file which was Starling's.  We read: "None 

of this is in your control.  Be happy.  Be kind." And, as 

Brigham's hands come into the frame to gather the material 

up, we see the auction house catalogue, and the photo of the 

drawing, and Starling's notes:  lion and bird, marble 

sculpture cemetery, Florence, Italy.


INT. ALITALIA AIRLINER - DAY. 


ANGLE INS.


An italian passport, a debarkation card, several snapshots, 

shuffled into the group, by a man's hands.  We see the 

snapshot of Pazzi in front of the mason Verger wanted poster.  

Snaps of Pazzi, in SWAT gear, on the range at Quantico, 

wearing a FBI "gimme" hat, a postcard of the Lincoln Monument, 

V.O. An italian voice urging all passengers to remain seated 

until et cetera.


ANGLE INT THE CABIN OF THE AIRLINER.


The italian Stewardess is ushering folks off the plane.  We 

see Pazzi putting all his papers together, and he reaches 

down a flightbag from the overhead, and joins the line of 

exiting passengers.


ANGLE IN THE JETWAY, AN ARMED SOLDIER, HIS SMG SLUNG IN FRONT 

OF HIM, IS READING AN ITALIAN NEWSPAPER.


As the jetway pulls up to snuggle with the jet, the soldier 

drops the paper onto the stool before him, and comes to 

attention.


Angle in the plane, the Stewardess opens the door, the 

passengers exit, she and Pazzi exchange a brief, whispered 

flirtation as he passes.  As he moves past her, she gives a 

small whoop in response to some clandestine caress of his.


A whispered conference between the two.


STEWARDESS

...Is that the way for a public 

official to act?


PAZZI

(shrugs)

You represent italy.  Call it an 

inspection...


STEWARDESS

Shouldn't that be carried out in 

depth?


PAZZI

...I have to get back to my wife...


He shrugs sadly, and moves past her.


Camera takes Pazzi into the jetway, where we now see two 

plainclothes Cop types, waiting, as Pazzi comes through they 

nod to him, and the group starts to exit out of the side 

walkway of the jetway.


PAZZI

...What's up...?


One of the men reaches for the paper, which the soldier has 

dropped, and takes it with him.


ANGLE EXT THE JETWAY.


The group of three descends onto the tarmac under the jetway, 

where there is a car with a bluelight on it, waiting.


They get into the car, and one of the Cops hands the paper 

to Pazzi.


ANGLE INT THE CAR, AS IT PROCEEDS THROUGH THE AIRPORT.


Pazzi turns to the page indicated.


COP ONE

How was america?


PAZZI

(looking at the paper)

Bad coffee, and women with excessive 

ankles.


COP ONE

...Nightmare.


PAZZI

What's up...?


COP ONE

(pointing to paper)

Doctore carlo fanelli, curator of 

the pallazo capponi, 2 months missing.


PAZZI

Yeah, so where is he?


COP ONE

Somewhere where his family are 

offering a thirty grand reward for 

information, so on.


PAZZI

They got that kind of money?


COP ONE

Their family owns...


He speaks, but the noise of a jet running up washes out his 

info.  Pazzi's eyes, however, grow wide.


PAZZI

Well, let's find him...


COP ONE

...Buya lot of pasta for your wife.


COP TWO

She don't eat pasta, that's how come 

she's so slim.


COP ONE

Heresa file onnaguy, you got a 

meeting, the palazzo capponi, at 

four thirty.


PAZZI

I can't even go home and change...?


COP TWO

What'd you bring me...?


The car is stopped at a barrier.  A guard comes out, and the 

Cop driving flashes official looking info at him.


INT THE CAR.


Pazzi distributes two FBI academy hats, to the two Cops.


The car passes through the barrier.  Camera tracks with it 

through the "arrivals" roundabout.  And we see two billboards, 

the first announces, the Florence ballet, with appropriate 

dates and inducements.  The second, shows a guillotine, and 

announces:   instruments of atrocious torture.  Now through 

October, et cetera.


INT THE CAR.


PAZZI

What else did I miss...?


One of the men gestures at the "torture" poster.


COP ONE

Atrocious torture.  Hit of the season, 

you want, I know a guy can get you a 

ticket.


PAZZI

...Are they hard to get?


COP ONE

Impossible.


PAZZI

(shaking his head 

sadly)

...What a world.


INT. PAZZI'S APARTMENT - DAY.


A nice modern small apartment.  Anna Pazzi, a very beautiful 

woman of around thirty is standing in the hall, as Pazzi 

enters.


He begins kissing her, and camera moves them into the bedroom.


ANNA

What's the rush?  What's the rush...?


PAZZI

Aren't you glad to see me?


ANNA

Tell me about your trip... What did 

you bring me...?


He stops, and rummages in his case, and brings out a bottle 

of perfume.  He gives it to her.  She looks disappointed.


ANNA

...And?


PAZZI

I brought you my passion and my wish 

that this afternoon will be for you 

an experience of ecstasy...


She fends him off.


PAZZI

...What?


ANNA

I can't think.


PAZZI

...You don't have to think.


ANNA

We have to talk about money...


PAZZI

I'm on the track of a reward, which...


ANNA

A reward...


PAZZI

I'm going to tell you later....


ANNA

A reward for what?


PAZZI

Some museum director disappeared.


ANNA

And?


PAZZI

They're offering...

(as he moves her toward 

the bed)


ANNA

...You haven't found him yet.


PAZZI

What is this, a whorehouse, or are 

you my wife?


ANNA

You've gone off to America, on your 

vacation...


PAZZI

...I was working...


ANNA

...Please...


PAZZI

I swear to you...


ANNA

...And I want to talk to you about 

your promotion..


PAZZI

Yes?  My promotion...?


ANNA

I want to talk to you about your 

salary.  Because I can't...


He takes off his jacket, he takes the perfume box from her, 

and throws it into the opened suitcase.  He moves her toward 

the bed.


ANGLE ON THE SUITCASE,


where we see the perfume has landed in the very scarf which 

Starling gave to Pazzi earlier, also in the still-life is 

Pazzi's passport case, out of the top of which we see peeking 

a bit of the photograph showing the wanted poster "three 

million dollars reward for the whereabouts of the monster, 

Hannibal Lechter."


They continue to talk, as the audience reads the information 

in the insert.


PAZZI (V.O.)

(concluding)

I need you, y'understand, I need 

you...


ANNA (V.O.)

...Everybody needs something...


We see the light go out in the room (i.e. On the insert shot)


Putting the room into semi-darkness.


EXT. PALLAZZO VECCHIO - DAY.


The sedan with Pazzi and Cop one comes to a halt.


Cop one throws a police pass on the dashboard, and they get 

out, Cop one hurrying.


PAZZI

(following, as he 

ties his tie)

Hold up a minute...


COP ONE

You spend the afternoon in bed?


PAZZI

First things first.


COP ONE

You take this much time over 

everything?


PAZZI

That's why my wife adores me.


INT. PALAZZO VECCHIO, VARIOUS RECONSTRUCTION AND RENOVATION 

GOING ON.


Pazzi and Cop one mount the stairs.


COP ONE

Carlo Fanelli, Dottore, missing two 

months.  He was the director of the 

museum.  Which, since his absence...


They have arrived on a landing.  Various restoration crews 

are at work.  Professor Ricci, a contemporary of Pazzis, 

comes up to him.


RICCI

Ah, Pazzi.  How was america...?


They turn their heads.  At the sound of shouting.


ANGLE THEIR POV.


A large salon, its double door open, and ten chair arranged 

around a table, all full of seated older men, of whom several 

are expostulating with another figure, unseen.


ANGLE ON RICCI, PAZZI, ET AL.


RICCI

We may need you to stop bloodshed.


PAZZI

What're they on about?


RICCI

They're grilling the applicant for 

the vacant post.


PAZZI

Speaking of the vacant post.


RICCI

Dottore Fanelli...


COP

He hasn't, by any chance, wandered 

back in?


As Cop one talks with Ricci, camera goes over the shoulder 

of Pazzi, who, gingerly enters the salon, to the sight and 

sound of the old men arguing with each other.


ANGLE, HIS POV.  THE OLD MEN AT THE TABLE.


Sogliato, a Fellow in his seventies, is holding the floor.


SOGLIATO

Now:  our applicant holds in his 

hand, in his non-italian-hand, a 

note, from Dante Aligheri himself.  

Would he recognize it, I think not...


ANOTHER OLD MAN

You want the job for your nephew.


SOGLIATO

Indeed I do.  Because he is my nephew?  

No.  Because he...


THIRD OLD MAN

Let him read the note...


SOGLIATO

Yes, fine, of course he can read the 

note.  His italian is admirable, for 

a straniero.  But is he familiar 

with...


ANGLE ON THE MAN, PREVIOUSLY UNSEEN OF WHOM THEY ARE TALKING.


The movement of the pov reveals him, standing alone, back to 

camera, before a half cloth-covered tapestry, dressed in a 

magnificent suit, using half-glasses to look down at a note 

in his hand.


SOGLIATO (V.O.)

The personalities of pre-renaissance 

Florence?  I think not.


The man (Hannibal Lechter/Dr. Fell) still seen from the rear--

still looking at the note--nods to indicate he has heard.


ANGLE HIS POV


The table of old men, and beyond them, Pazzi.


Ricci appears at Pazzi's side, and speaks in whispers.


RICCI

(sotto)

...A Dr. Fell.  A brazilian, I think.  

Applying for Fanelli's post.


PAZZI

(vacantly)

Brazilian.

(Ricci hands some 

forms to Pazzi)


RICCI

It would seem.


SOGLIATO (V.O.)

What if he came upon a note in, the 

Capponi library, this great Italian 

institution, which he now graces us 

with his bid to direct, a note from 

Guido de Cavalcanti.  Would he 

recognize it, I think not.


ANGLE ON DR. FELL, STILL SEEN FROM THE REAR,


As he takes silk square from his breast pocket, and cleans 

his half-glasses, then folds them and puts them and the square 

back in his pocket.


SOGLIATO (V.O.)

Would you care to address that, Dr.  

Fell...?


Beat.  Dr. Fell turns to camera, still holding the note.


He takes several paces, to look at the note in a shaft of 

sunlight.


He is standing beside the statue of Judith and Holofernes.


He nods at the note, as if confirming something.  Then he 

looks up.


DR. FELL

Cavalcanti replied publicly to Dante's 

first sonnet.  Do you know it, 

professor Sogliato?  I believe it's 

worth your time:  listen to the way 

he makes an instrument of the italian 

vernacular, which he called the 

vulgari eloquentia-- the eloquent 

voice of the people: allegro me 

sembrava amor tenedo/meo core in 

mano, e ne la braccia avea/madonna 

involta in un drappa dormedo/poi la 

svegliava a d'esto ardeno/lei 

paventosa umilmente pascea/appreso 

gir lo ne vedea paingendo.  If Dante 

had written to a Cavalcanti, it would, 

of course, have been to Andrea, the 

most literary of his brothers...


SOGLIATO

...Why do you want this job?


DR. FELL

In the hope, that someday, I should 

come across such a note.  I thank 

you Gentleman for your kind attention, 

and hope you will consider...


The meeting is about to break up, the old men are rising, 

Fell hands back the note, which is encased in a protector, 

Ricci comes forward with Pazzi, and begins introducing him 

to the committee.


RICCI

...Investigating the disappearance 

of Dottore Fanelli...


PAZZI

Who, can you think, who would want 

to harm Dr. Fanelli, did he have any 

enemies, that...


COMMITTEE MEMBER

...I have never met a man who was so 

well beloved.


PAZZI

...He was wealthy...


COMMITTEE MEMBER

He had nothing.  He lived in a garret.  

His work was his life, he...


PAZZI

...His family has offered a large 

reward.


ANGLE ON FELL, WHO GOES TO THE PEDIMENT OF THE STATUE OF


Judith and Holofernes, and picks up a small sketch book, 

which is opened at a sketch of the statue, he puts the book 

under his arm.  Angle on Pazzi and the Committee member.


COMMITTEE MEMBER

His older brother offers the reward, 

Ffanelli had nothing, he....


ANGLE.


Pazzi half turns his head, to see several Committee members 

congratulating dr. Fell, who is putting on his coat.


COMMITTEE MEMBER

...Will have, of course to be examined 

by the studiolo, to confirm the 

appointment, but I think I can assure 

you, that the committee...


DR. FELL

...You are most kind...


ANGLE, ON PAZZI, WHO IS STILL BEING TALKED AT BY THE COMMITTEE 

MEMBER.


COMMITTEE MEMBER

..Who would benefit from his 

disappearance?  No one.  No one has 

but lost by it...


Angle Pazzi starts toward dr. Fell.


PAZZI

(to the Committee 

member)

...Would you excuse me...?


ANGLE EXT THE SALON, ON THE LANDING, FELL IS BEING ADDRESSED 

BY RICCI.


RICCI

...Will have to face the studiolo, 

in their meeting next week.  And I, 

for one, wish you the best.


Fell shakes his hand, and starts down the staircase.


CAMERA GOES WITH HIM, WE HEAR PAZZI VO.


PAZZI (V.O.)

Dottore...


Fell turns, and Pazzi comes to catch up with him.


PAZZI

Pazzi, rinaldo, commendatore, 

prefatura...


FELL

Of course, commendatore...


Camera takes them down the stairs, as they talk.


PAZZI

Could you tell me:  did you ever 

meet your predecessor, Dottore 

Fanelli...?


FELL

I never met him.  I knew him only 

from his writings.


PAZZI

I know that the Officers who first 

investigated his disappearance 

Searched for a note, a farewell note, 

a suicide note...


FELL

...Yes.


PAZZI

You have taken over his offices, is 

that not so?


FELL

It is only temporary, until my 

confirmation by...


PAZZI

Of course, in his offices, if you 

come across anything, any personal 

papers of his, anything, however 

trivial, would you contact me, 

please... Are his personal effects 

still at the palazzo?


FELL

Yes.  Packed and with an inventory.

(he hesitates, and 

looks at Pazzi)

Pazzi and Fell walk out of the museum.


ANGLE EXT THE MUSEUM.


PAZZI

I'll have them picked up.


Pazzi gestures to his Colleague.


PAZZI

May we drop you?


FELL

Thank you, I am most happy to walk 

in this most magnificent of cities.


Fell starts pulling on his gloves, he hands his sketchbook 

to Pazzi for a moment.  Pazzi looks down.


ANGLE PAZZI'S POV


Fell's left hand, has a scar on the back in the shape of a


PAZZI

May I ask you a personal question, 

Dr.  Fell?


FELL

If your duty requires it.


PAZZI

You have a recent scar on the back 

of your hand.


FELL

And you have a new wedding ring on 

yours?  La vita nuova?--

(he smiles.)


PAZZI

You looked oddly at me, back on the 

landing.


FELL

Yes, it must be hard to be a 

policeman.  Is it hard?  Must one, 

then, be constantly suspicious?


PAZZI

Why did you look at me that way?


FELL

(smiles)

I saw a man in disheveled clothing, 

but clean.  Just dressed--in the 

middle of the...


Fell shakes his head, asking to have the question withdrawn.


PAZZI

...Please...


FELL

(shrugs, smiles)

I saw a man, somewhat fatigued.  

Quickly dressed, a bit dishevelled.  

In the middle of the day.

(smiles)

An old story.  And then I saw the 

clothing was fresh--therefore:  a 

man who dressed at home.  And then I 

remarked the new wedding ring.  And 

so:  the story gave me pause.  A 

lovely story.  A new, and a beloved 

wife.  I wish you joy.

(fell starts to exit)

Pazzi walks with him.


PAZZI

You assemble this, on the instant, 

from these few observations?


FELL

(shrugs)

I'm a historian.  It is our task to 

assemble the seemingly unconnected 

into the obvious.


PAZZI

...Your scar..?


FELL

My scar is a war-wound.


PAZZI

How so?


FELL

Carpal-tunnel syndrome.  From a life 

of typing.  Commendatore.  History, 

a hazardous profession.


Fell and then Pazzi stop.


FELL

You are a Pazzi of the Pazzim are 

you not?


PAZZI

Yes.  How did you know?


FELL

You resemble a figure from the Della 

Robia rondels, in your family's chapel 

at Santa Croce.


PAZZI

It was adresa de Pazzi, depicted as 

John the Baptist.  You have seen the 

chapel?


FELL

I have had the honor.

(he bows and starts 

off.  Pazzi goes 

after him.)

Fell turns to him.


FELL

I wondered that an Officer of your 

exalted rank should come, so late, 

into the case.


PAZZI

And?  Then?


FELL

I wonder no longer.  You were out of 

the country.


PAZZI

How could you know?


FELL

I sense...

(he touches his nose)

The faintest whiff of a perfume, 

whose base, whose base, whose base 

is "hamamelis"... It is witch-hazel--

such a clean scent.  No, not a 

european scent.  I would say it is a 

scent of the new world.  I would 

say, you have been in America.  Have 

I struck home?


PAZZI

You know America?


FELL

...You have brought this perfume... 

Brought this perfume.  Back.  Back 

from America.  To your new wife...

(he picks up his hand, 

and glances down at 

Pazzi's wedding ring.)

You have given it to her, and some 

of...

(he smiles)

Some of 'her perfume' has found its 

way back onto you.  Lucky man.  Lucky 

man, indeed.


He bows, and starts to take his leave, from the startled 

Pazzi.  Pazzi comes to his senses, and hands a card to Fell.


PAZZI

Should you come across anything 

which...


FELL

You will be the first I call.


Fell turns to leave, turns back, and takes his hand and, 

gently rubs it on the lapel of Pazzi's suitjacket, he then, 

delicately, holds the hand under his nose, and nods, as if 

in agreement with himself.


He nods, and walks off into a park.


ANGLE ON PAZZI, WHO LOOKS AFTER FELL.  HE WALKS BACK TOWARD


The car.  He turns, to look after Fell, and we see he is 

standing by a line of people, a queue, under a banner which 

proclaims, "Atrocious instruments of torture."


Pazzi shakes his head, as if to clear it, and starts toward 

his car, where Cop one opens the door for him.


ANGLE ON FELL, AS CAMERA TAKES HIM INTO THE PARK, WHICH, WE 

SEE,


Is a cemetery.


He sits on a bench, and takes out his sketchbook, and begins 

to draw.


ANGLE HIS POV.


A piece of funerary statuary, the lion, holding the bird in 

his mouth.


ANGLE ON DR. FELL, SKETCHING.  TIGHT.


He sketches, he raises his hand to his nose and inhales, and 

nods again.


ANGLE, FROM THE SIDE, WE NOW SEE THE STATUE AND FELL'S 

DRAWING.  HE IS DRAWING, NOT THE STATUE, BUT A SKETCH OF 

CLARICE STARLING.


DISSOLVE TO:


EXT. MARYLAND MISERICORDIA HOSPITAL - DAY.


Various unfortunate people, entering the hospital;  leaving 

the hospital, a vast giant of a man, shrugging himself into 

an army fatigue jacket over orderly's whites.  (Barney)


ANGLE STARLING, STANDING AT A BUSSTOP, READING A PAPER.


ANGLE INS.


In the paper is secreted a photo of Barney, on FBI xerox 

form, with his name, and description.


ANGLE STARLING WAITS AT THE BUSSTOP.  BARNEY PASSES IN FRONT 

OF HER, AND CONTINUES WALKING.  STARLING FOLDS THE PAPER AND 

GOES AFTER HIM.


ANGLE RUNDOWN RESIDENTIAL NEIGHBORHOOD, DAY.


Barney, now holding a small bag of groceries, crosses the 

street.


We see Starling in the bg.


Barney stops, in the middle of the road.  We see he is looking 

up overhead.


ANGLE INS HIS POV.


A dove, circling in the sky.


ANGLE XCU.


Barney looking up, puzzled, and then he looks down.


ANGLE HIS POV.


In the road ahead, a dead dove.


BARNEY WALKS INTO THE POV, PICKS UP THE DOVE, AND WALKS TO


Small ratty verge of park.  He puts the dove down, lovingly 

in the grass, and we watch, as the other dove lands on a 

fence, nearby.


Barney starts to walk toward the live bird.


ANGLE OVER THE BIRD, ONTO BARNEY, WITH STARLING WALKING UP 

BEHIND HIM.


Barney hesitates, his back still to Starling.


BARNEY

Are you attracted by death?

(pause)

It is the one great mystery, is it 

not?  Anyone who would say otherwise 

must be a hypocrite.  Don't you 

think...?


He turns for the first time and looks at her.


BARNEY

...Or are you only attracted by 

power...

(he changes his tack 

and tone.)

How are you, Agent Starling?


STARLING

Ah, Barney:  you've got a good memory.


BARNEY

You know why that is?  Because there 

are so few things I need to forget.  

Would you agree, for the record, 

that I have not been read my rights?


STARLING

I have not read you your rights.


BARNEY

Would you mind saying that into your 

bag...?


Starling starts to open her bag, and speaks into it.


STARLING

I hereby acknowledge that...


BARNEY

And now I have "dociled" you, have I 

not?  By forcing your obedience.


STARLING

(smiling)

Then why did you chose to inform me 

of it...?


BARNEY

To show...

(pause)

In my ability to squander.  What one 

might deem an advantage... That my 

strength is greater than yours...


STARLING

Oh yeah?  Wanna arm wrestle...?


BARNEY

If you'll come down the street I 

will make you a cup of coffee.


INT. BARNEY'S APARTMENT - DAY.


As they enter, the apartment with many deadbolts.  Starling 

enters warily and takes a seat with her back to the wall, in 

the small studio.


As Barney begins making coffee.


BARNEY

You almost took down Evelda Drumgo.


STARLING

Well.  Word gets around.


BARNEY

...What hindered you...?


STARLING

It wasn't my day.


BARNEY

Perhaps you did not have the support 

you required.


STARLING

It's a poor workman who blames his 

tools.


BARNEY

Or, perhaps...


STARLING

...How are things at the hospital?


BARNEY

It's a growth business.


STARLING

What have they got you doing?


BARNEY

Orderly.


STARLING

I would have figured you an R.N. by 

now, or, maybe med school.


BARNEY

I prefer to stay in the less frivolous 

professions.


STARLING

(takes out a notebook)

You lasted eight years, as orderly, 

in Dr. Lechter's prison ward.


BARNEY

Yes, I presumed it was about him.


STARLING

...You...


BARNEY

I'm struck by your phraseology.  I 

did not last with him.  I was 

privileged to enjoy his company during 

that time.


STARLING

(getting down to 

business, as she 

takes out a pencil.)

I'm looking for...


BARNEY

He said, and these were his words, 

he valued our time together, because 

I was civil.


STARLING

Did you ever think, did you think, 

after he escaped, he would come after 

you?


BARNEY

He told me, he preferred to eat the 

rude.  Or:  "natural composting."  

Do you think he'd come after you...?


Starling looks out the window.


ANGLE HER POV


Out the window, se see the dove circling the dead dove on 

the ratty piece of grass.


STARLING

(turning back)

What...?


BARNEY

I asked you how you like your 

coffee...?  We have black and bitter.  

As the soul of man.  Or light and 

sweet, as the world-view of the self-

delusive.


STARLING

We got a bunch of materials, coming 

up at auction.  Materials which 

disappeared from Dr. Lechter's cell, 

drawings he made, his books.


BARNEY

Yes?


STARLING

And I'd like your help, determining 

who's bidding for their purchase.


BARNEY

Why me?


STARLING

Waal, because your selling'em... Two 

years ago, his annotated dictionary 

of cuisine, by Alexander Dumas, went 

for sixteen thousand dollars.  

Seller's affidavit of ownership, 

signed Cary Panz.  P.A.N.Z.  Sounds 

to me like an orderly.  Whadja clear 

on the book?  Ten, twelve grand?


BARNEY

...Very good.


STARLING

Here's what they want you to do:  we 

want the rest of the stuff you stole 

from his cell.


BARNEY

...Why?


STARLING

Let's just say they got a passion 

for collectibles...


BARNEY

You said "here's what they want you 

to do..."  Why?


STARLING

Now, whyn't you help us?


BARNEY

That would adversely impact my income.


STARLING

Not as much as being jailed for theft 

of government property, or for failure 

to pay income tax, on undisclosed 

income.


BARNEY

We could skip the gavotte.


STARLING

Say it in english.


BARNEY

Lechter's not buying up his 

memorabilia.  He keeps it all in his 

"mind," do you see...?


STARLING

Then who's buying it?


BARNEY

(shrugs)

There's one or two freaks, and, for 

a "pass," I'll rat them out to you...

(he takes a pencil, 

and puts a couple of 

names in her book, 

leaning over her)


STARLING

That's the spirit...


ANGLE, BARNEY AS HE LEANS OVER, LOOMING OVER STARLING.


BARNEY

...Aren't you afraid of me...?


STARLING

You want me to be?


BARNEY

I'd prefer it...

(he finishes writing)

But it's just a vacant exercise.


He and Starling finish their coffee.  He begins to walk her 

out.


ANGLE EXT BARNEY'S APARTMENT, AS THEY EXIT.


STARLING

A vacant exercise, why...?


BARNEY

You said "here's what they want you 

to do."  Aren't you part of them 

anymore...?  Aren't you part of the 

FBI? 'No girl's allowed,' or what?  

Have you transgressed...?


STARLING

Let's keep it to business, shall we?


BARNEY

...Why have they stuck you on this 

silly little roust?


STARLING

...They did it for a lark.


BARNEY

Oh, good.  The ornithological 

leitmotif...


He takes her over to the dead bird.  He picks up the dead 

bird, and smooths its feathers.  He addresses the circling 

dove.


BARNEY

Off you go.  You've grieved enough.  

Anything more would be self-

indulgence.


STARLING

(as she looks at her 

book of names)

Who are these guys...?


BARNEY

Rich, comic book freaks.


STARLING

And why is it a vacant exercise?


BARNEY

Because we both know who's buying 

the Lechteriana.


STARLING

Who would that be.


BARNEY

(as if stating the 

most obvious fact.)

Mason Verger.  For he cannot be free.  

Dr. Lechter refashioned his body so 

it mirrors his soul, what an 

impossible injustice.  Can you be 

free....?


STARLING

No, you're wrong about Verger.


BARNEY

Oh, yes.  He's found peace.


STARLING

Well, if he hasn't, I'm vastly 

mistaken.


BARNEY

(pauses, and looks at 

her intently)

And have you found peace..?

(pause)


ANGLE, ON BARNEY, AS HE STARTS PUTTING THE DEAD BIRD IN HIS 

POCKET.


STARLING

What'll you do with the bird...?


BARNEY

Pluck it, and eat it.  It was so 

good to see you..


Barney goes back into his apartment building.


INT. FBI HEADQUARTERS - DAY.


Starling is coming into the readyroom area, and passes John 

Brigham.


BRIGHAM

How you doin?


STARLING

M'i gonna see you tonight?


BRIGHAM

That's right.


STARLING

Then I'm doing fine.


BRIGHAM

What's new onna street?


STARLING

All quiet along the Potomac...


A Technician walks by and Starling rips a page out of her 

notebook and hands it to him.


STARLING

Can we run this guy down?


TECHNICIAN

Who is he?


STARLING

His job description?  He's a comic 

book freak.


TECHNICIAN

Whadda we want him for...?


STARLING

Insufficient animation.  Just get me 

his vital signs, will you...?

(to Brigham)

Catcha later...

(she walks on.)


ANGLE INS.


The x-ray marked Hannibal Lechter.  Next to it, a sketch of 

the back of the hand, with a scar, in the shape of a numeral 

3 on it.


A Technician is discussing the materials with Crawford.


TECHNICIAN

Which would, of necessity, have left 

this scar in the shape of the number 

"3."


CRAWFORD

Why a three?


TECHNICIAN

It requires two flaps to close the 

area between the...


Starling passes.


CRAWFORD

Starling:  come look at this:  Did 

you see this?


STARLING

Yes sir, I saw it.

(he hands her a Copy 

of the x-ray.)


CRAWFORD

(nods)

We have a memo here, from your friend 

Mr. Krendler at the justice 

department.


STARLING

I am all attention.


CRAWFORD

He requests your presence, once again, 

as part of...


He hands her the memo.


INT. FBI CAFETERIA - DAY.


Starling comes down the steamtable line with a tray.  Camera 

takes her to Mapp, who is eating lunch, Starling sits.


STARLING

Just the person I'm looking for.


MAPP

And why would that be...?


Starling sits and starts to eat.  Mapp picks up the memo 

from the small folder on Starling's tray.


STARLING

Because you're going to help me plan 

a party.


MAPP

You're going to do that?


STARLING

I'm going to do it, and you're going 

to catch the bouquet.


Mapp reads the memo.


MAPP

The multi-jurisdiction task force:  

read alphabet soup, for the continued 

pursuit, and in preparation for the 

apprehension of the fugitive, Evelda 

Drumgo.  The man's hazing you.


STARLING

My daddy would say:  accept with 

glee the things you cannot change.


Mapp picks up the x-ray.


MAPP

I'll tell you what:  I should go in 

there, volunteer to fill up his female 

quota.

(of the x-ray.  She 

holds it up, seeking 

information)


STARLING

Mr. Crawford asked my opinion.  Here 

we've got a purported x-ray, Dr.  

Lechter's surgery.  Do we keep it 

secret, or broadcast it?


MAPP

Saying what, "look out for a guy 

with ten fingers...?"


STARLING

Yeah, that's too hip for the room.


MAPP

(of the note)

You stay offa this alphabet soup 

detail, all this half-baked, cowboy 

stuff, till after you get your mind 

cleared.... You don't wanna go out 

there a half-step slow...


STARLING

I don't wanna go out there at all...


MAPP

What do you want to do?  You want to 

jam up that sonofabitch Krendler.


STARLING

No.  I want to buy a dog.

(pause)


MAPP

What broke you free, girl?


STARLING

I met a man, and his troubles were 

greater than mine...


She extracts the small card Verger has given her.  And we 

see it, as she looks at it.


"do not give in to adversity.  Do not trust to property.  

None of this is in your control.  Be happy.  Be kind."


INT. VERGER'S MANSION - PLAYROOM - DAY.


Happy small Children playing.  One small boy, smiling, is 

approached by a lovely young Nurse, dressed in white.  She 

whispers to him and he smiles and nods, and takes her hand, 

as they walk off.


ANGLE INT VERGER'S MEDICAL FACILITY.


We see the young child, Franklin, being led off on a TV 

screen.  We see his progress onto another screen showing the 

hall, and the old woman, Rosie, knitting.


ANGLE CORDELL, STANDING BY VERGER'S BED.


Cordell holds a folder marked "Department of Child Welfare.  

City of baltimore."


He is finished reading it.


CORDELL

"...And age-appropriate large and 

small motor skills.  His unfortunate 

home situation has made it necessary 

for Franklin to form immediate 

attachments with adults, which we 

understand to have contributed to 

many instances of his abuse."


Sound of a "whoosh," as a door opens, Cordell closes the 

folder.  He looks toward the door.


ANGLE IN THE BED,


Verger, his face obscured by a television monitor.  We hear 

the whir of a tv camera.


We see the camera, above Verger's bed, moving.


ANGLE ON A TV SCREEN, WE SEE THE CAMERA TRACK, AND TAKE THE


Frightened Franklin, and the Nurse standing next to him, the 

Nurse motions Franklin forward.


ANGLE, ON CORDELL,


Looking down at Verger.  (NB throughout, Verger should never 

be seen.  He is inferred through the reactions of those around 

him.  And he, and in particular, his face should always be 

obscured--a tease--by this or that intervening object.


Cordell nods, as if in response to a sign from Verger.  He 

lays the hospital folder on a sort of xerox machine.


ANGLE ON VERGER'S ELECTRONIC DISPLAY.  THE VARIOUS TV


Screens, the hospital folder, now coming into view on a screen 

on which we read the logo of the Baltimore Child Welfare, 

and "James, Franklin, born June 5, 1991," and a photo of 

him.  On the adjacent screen we see the young boy coming 

forward at the urging of his Nurse.  His eyes growing wide 

with fear.


ANGLE FROM BEHIND FRANKLIN,


As his body obscures our view of Verger, and we hear the 

electronically enhanced voice of Verger conversing with him.


VERGER

Are you Franklin ?


FRANKLIN

...Franklin.


VERGER

Where do you live?


FRANKLIN

With mama and Shirley and Stringbean.


ANGLE SHIFT TO OVER VERGER,


Onto the frightened boy.  In the bg we see the Nurse beating 

a strategic retreat to the door, and after her exit, we see 

her appear on the screen which shows the corridor, taking a 

chair across from "Rosie," we see her sit and take out a 

book and read.  As Verger talks with Franklin, we see the 

information on the "text" screen scroll, which new info we 

see reflected in Verger's questions.


FRANKLIN

But Stringbean, he in and out.


VERGER

In and out.  Yes.  And mama... And 

mama, is not your real mama, is she 

Franklin?


FRANKLIN

She my foster.


VERGER

She's not the first foster that you've 

had.  Is she?


FRANKLIN

No.

(the child looks 

around, and, finding 

no support, looks 

back at Verger.)


VERGER

Do you like it at your home, Franklin?


FRANKLIN

(frightening)

We got kittykat...


VERGER

Yes... Yes...


FRANKLIN

...And Shirley, let me sleep with 

her sometime.


VERGER

Yes.  Franklin, you can't live there 

anymore.  With mama and Shirley and 

kittykat.  You have to go away.


FRANKLIN

...Who say...?


VERGER

The government says.  Mama has lost 

her job, so she can't be your foster 

Mother.  The police found a marijuana 

cigarette in your home.  You can't 

see mama anymore.  Or Shirley.  Or 

kitty cat.  That's what the government 

says...


ANGLE XCU ON FRANKLIN.


VERGER

...Or perhaps they just don't want 

you anymore.  Could that be?  And, 

do you know what will happen to kitty 

cat?  When you go away.  The police 

will take her, and they'll give her 

a shot.  With a shiny needle.  They'll 

give kitty cat a shot.  And it will 

hurt her.  And then she will die.


Franklin takes the tail of his shirt from his pants and holds 

it to his eyes.


ANGLE ON VERGER'S BED, AND ON CORDELL BEHIND HIM, GLANCING 

THROUGH


A file.


Cordell looks up at the wailing of Franklin.


VERGER

Come here...

(beat.  Franklin comes 

forward, his face 

screwing up in terror 

as the detail of 

Verger become more 

apparent.  He stops 

moving forward.)

Do you know how you keep kittycat 

from getting a shot?  Franklin?  No?  

Do you know.  Then come here...


Franklin comes forward.


VERGER

You can keep kitty cat from getting 

a shot if...


ANGLE ON CORDELL,


Who reacts to some sign from Verger, and nods, and takes a 

small package from a pocket in his coat.


ANGLE ON CORDELL,


Who gives the package to Franklin.


VERGER

If you give him this...


ANGLE ON FRANKLIN, AS HE LOOKS DOWN AT THE PACKAGE IN HIS


Hands.


ANGLE INS:

It is a package of rat poison.


ANGLE ON FRANKLIN, HOLDING THE POISON, HE LOOKS UP AS VERGER


Talks.


VERGER

You can keep her from getting the 

shot, if you give her that rat poison 

yourself...


ANGLE, HOLD ON FRANKLIN,


Who begins to weep Copiously.


ANGLE,


On the video screen showing Franklin, as we hear a servo 

motor, and the screen zooms in to show a tear.


ANGLE ON CORDELL,


Who is now at a small wetbar, mixing vodka and vermouth and 

pouring them into a martini shaker.


He glances over, and nods.


ANGLE


On Cordell, as he pushes a button on a console.  On the screen 

over Verger's bed we see the Nurse in the hall react.  She 

puts her paperback book into her pocket, and rises, and we 

see her enter Verger's room, and stand by the door.


VERGER

Goodbye, Franklin.


Cordell walks Franklin to the door.


VERGER

...Remember what we talked about.


We hear Verger's electronically amplified breathing become 

excited, and on the lifesigns screens, we see his vital signs 

Become more agitated, and the Nurse, and Cordell start toward 

the bed.


VERGER

(as his breathing 

quiets)

No, I'm fine...


We see Cordell start back into the room, and then, at the 

sound of Verger's voice turn away again.


ANGLE


At the door, Cordell signs to the Nurse, and stoops to the 

crying Franklin.


Cordell takes a sterile plastic bag from his pocket, he 

removes from it a clamp, in the jaws of which are a small 

square of cotton gauze.  He stoops to Franklin, and carefully 

takes one of Franklin's tears onto the gauze.  He nods to 

the Nurse, who exits with Franklin.


He disappears from the shot.


ANGLE ON VERGER.


VERGER

..What have we heard from our friend 

at the FBI...?


ANGLE ON CORDELL, AS HE TAKES AN ENVELOPE, AND EXTRACTS


Xerox of an x-ray and puts it on the screen, we see it is 

the "Brazilian" x-ray of Lechter's hand.  We see an imprint 

at the top of the x-ray--the patients name and the lab name 

ripped away--all that remains are the words "...Do Brazil."


CORDELL

Most current information shows the 

result of an operation for the removal 

of a sixth digit, the left hand of a 

man.


VERGER

Can we identify it as Dr. Lechter?


CORDELL

Not with any certainty we...


Verger's breathing again becomes excitable.


VERGER

Why did he come back?


CORDELL

Our operatives in brazil have been 

empowered to offer a reward of...


VERGER

...Why did he come back?  Why did 

the boy turn back...?


CORDELL

...Are you alright, sir...?


VERGER

He turned back into the room.  Where 

have we seen it before.


CORDELL

Seen what, sir..?


VERGER

The puppy comes back.  If you lie on 

the ground.  The puppy with return.  

Why?  Do you know why...?  To kill 

you.  It thinks you have fallen and 

are powerless.  It comes back to 

tear your throat.  That's why the 

child turned back.  As Lechter will 

return back.  You see?  To the sight 

of his oppressor wounded.  He will 

return to savage our beloved miss 

Starling.  Bring me a drink.


Cordell turns, back to the console.


We see Cordell turn, and approach the bed, holding the martini 

on a tray.


He puts the tray down on the bedtable.


ANGLE INS.


We see, on the small metal hospital tray, the martini shaker,


The martini glass, and a small beaker, in which is the clamp 

which bears the gauze pad which bears Franklin's tears.


Cordell shakes the shaker, pours it into the glass, and drops 

the gauze pad into it, and hands it to Verger.


CORDELL

Your drink, sir.


VERGER

It's time to step up the pressure on 

our sweet miss Starling. ...Call our 

friend at the F.B.I.  And, instead 

of finding Lechter, let's help him 

find us.


ANGLE ON ONE OF THE VIDEO SCREENS, WE SEE A SHEET LABELLED


"confidential FBI not for distribution."  And we see, in 

various squares below, the drawings by Lechter, the various 

funerary sketches.


Camera comes in on one of the middle, left, which shows the 

lion with a bird in its mouth.


EXT. FLORENCE PARK - NIGHT.


The statue of the lion holding the bird.  A couple walking 

past.


PAZZI

...The purpose of the exercise... Is 

it because they are expensive...


MRS. PAZZI

They aren't expensive, you got them 

through your connections... Speaking 

of which:


PAZZI

Fine, thank you, but


MRS. PAZZI

Speaking of which, I want you also 

to get us tickets for the opera...


PAZZI

...Whatever is within my power...


MRS. PAZZI

...And that is what you need to 

expand.


PAZZI

I don't understand.


MRS. PAZZI

(she stops and 

addresses him)

We are here on sufferance.  I am 

here...


PAZZI

...Why are we here in the first 

place...?


MRS. PAZZI

Because it is exclusive... Because 

everyone will be here...


Camera takes them past a sign announcing "Exhibition 

instruments of atrocious torture," and a velvet rope, and 

various well dressed people waiting to get in.


Pazzi walks to the head of the line, and shows his tickets, 

and is admitted.


ANGLE INT. THE EXHIBIT HALL.


An iron maiden.  A coffin showing spikes on one side, the 

other side empty, is an improvised entry to the exhibit.


Pazzi and his wife enter, she stops to gossip with a well 

dressed couple.


MRS. PAZZI

Mrs. Demetrio, how good to see you...


ANGLE ON PAZZI


As he drifts away.  We see him staring at various thumbscrews, 

a rack, a guillotine.  He stoops to read a placard.  His 

wife comes up behind him.


MRS. PAZZI

You see, that is my point.


PAZZI

...My love...


MRS. PAZZI

...They asked us to dinner.  How can 

we accept if we cannot return the...


PAZZI

I am on the track of...


MRS. PAZZI

Yes, yes, yes, your thirty thousand 

dollars reward, which you would have 

to split with your team, which, if 

you get it, will not buy me a new 

watch...

(she stops to greet 

another couple)


PAZZI

...What do you expect me to...


He stops, and turns away, when he sees that she is engrossed.  

He is now looking at a torture wheel.  He stops and looks 

intently into the gloom of the roped off exhibit.


ANGLE HIS POV


Inside the exhibit, in a dark corner, the figure of a man.


Sketching.


ANGLE XCU


On Fell, Lechter, in the gloom, sketching.


We see a good sketch of the wheel, on which he has added 

architectural notes on angles and distances.  He turns, 

feeling someone looking at him.


ANGLE HIS POV.


Pazzi, beyond the velvet rope.  Peering intently, returning 

Fell's glance.


Doublecutting:  we return to Pazzi, staring, we see him make 

a quick addendum to the sketch of the torture wheel.  And 

then return to Pazzi, leaning over to peer more closely into 

the gloom.


MRS. PAZZI

So, the question:  as always, Rinaldo, 

the question is one of mmm...


ANGLE ON MRS. PAZZI 


As Fell appears at their side, she turns to him.


FELL

Commendatore would you do me the 

honor of introducing me.


PAZZI

Darling, Dr. Fell.  My wife madame 

Pazzi.


FELL

(he bends to kiss her 

hand)

Enchante.


GUIDE

The exhibit is closing.  The exhibit 

is closing in ten minutes... Please 

make your way to the...


MRS. PAZZI

Dr. Fell.  You are not italian.


FELL

Sadly, no.  And I find that birth is 

one of the few things in life which 

study and a pleasant attitude can 

not amend.  What do you think?


MRS. PAZZI

And how do we account for the interest 

of such a charming man, an interest 

in torture?


PAZZI

Dr. Fell is studying for his 

examination by the studiolo.


FELL

Indeed I am.  And the connection, 

between Dante, and, in fact, between 

your illustrious forebears... If 

you'd come with me, I could show 

you...


He holds up the rope, as to lead them back into the exhibit.


PAZZI

But the exhibit is closing.


FELL

How unfortunate.


Pazzi starts to help his wife on with her wrap.


FELL

May I...?


He takes the wrap, and begins to drape it around her 

shoulders.


ANGLE EXT THE EXHIBIT.


On the street, the curious are exiting.


Fell concludes putting the wrap on mrs. Pazzi.


FELL

What a lovely perfume.  I believe I 

recognize it, do I not...?


MRS. PAZZI

My husband brought it to me from 

America.


FELL

A wonderful country...


An older man calls Pazzi away.


MRS. PAZZI

You know it?


FELL

I have had many excellent meals there.


MRS. PAZZI

And yet, they are not know for their 

cuisine.


FELL

(smiles)

...Should love to correct your error.

(pause)


MRS. PAZZI

Well, perhaps sometime we...


Pazzi rejoins the group.


PAZZI

Darling...


FELL

Well, if you will excuse me.  Madame.  

What a pleasure.


He moves away.


PAZZI

The Commissioner is going round the 

cafe...


MRS. PAZZI

...Did he invite us...?


PAZZI

No.  Invite us?  No, he simply...


MRS. PAZZI

Then we cannot go.


PAZZI

Because...?


MRS. PAZZI

Because we cannot pay...


He leads her off, the two obviously having a fight.


ANGLE IN THE GLOOM.


Lechter-Fell, looking at them appraisingly.


Int Pazzi's apartment night.


Pazzi sitting in shirtsleeves, his tie undone, a half full 

glass of whisky in front of him, at his desk.  His desk full 

of papers.  His wife in a housedress.  Ranting.


MRS. PAZZI

...Constant humiliation.  And why?


PAZZI

"because we don't have any money."


MRS. PAZZI

....Because we don't have any mmm...


Pazzi holds up a folder.


PAZZI

The case that I am working on...


Mrs. Pazzi takes the folder and flings it down.


MRS. PAZZI

It's a joke.  You're a joke.  You're 

a joke.  You don't know what money 

is--your idea of money...

(she picks up another 

file on the desk, 

and takes out the 

scarf given to Pazzi 

by Starling)

...Spend it on a whore on your 

'business trip.'  That is the fine 

limit of your ambitions...


ANGLE ON PAZZI


Rearranging the file.  We see, in an insert, the scarf, the 

"man wanted" poster, and FBI case study on Hannibal Lechter, 

and we hold on the "three million dollars reward."


ANGLE ON THE TWO, HIS WIFE STORMING OUT.


MRS. PAZZI

And if you do not find some money.  

Soon.  I'm leaving you.

(beat)

And I want tickets to the opera.


She closes the door of his study.


INT. FELL'S STUDY - NIGHT.


Fell, in a small elegant chamber of a palazzo.  Playing a 

clavier.  He stops to adjust a page on the music stand in 

front of him.  He resumes playing.


ANGLE HIS POV


The music stand.  It holds not music, but the sketch we saw 

him do earlier of Starling.  We see his hand adjust the pages 

once again, and the sketch of Starling is half-obscured by 

the sketch we saw Fell make of the torture wheel.  At the 

top of the sketch we see the added faces of Pazzi and mme 

Pazzi, sketched by Fell at the exhibit.


Angle frontal on Fell, as he stops playing.  He picks up a 

glass of wine which has been resting on the clavier, and 

takes one of the sketches and gazes intently at it.


He shivers slightly, and turns up the collar of his jacket.


ANGLE, AS HIS POV.


Snow blowing across a small window, the window rattling.


The snow blows the shade.  Inside the window we see bearded 

soldiers, cooking over a small fire made on the floor of the 

dishevelled home.


ANGLE ON A SMALL DARK BOY, DRESSED IN RAGS, IN THE BLOWING 

SNOW,


Looking into the window.


ANGLE HIS POV.


We see the soldier come toward the window and fasten it 

against the wind.


Angle the boy, backing across a small courtyard into the 

open door of a small factory building.


INT. DARK FACTORY BUILDING - NIGHT.


Starling is moving through the building, against the wall, 

hugging the wall.  She hears a sound, and turns.  She looks 

down.


ANGLE HER POV--A SMALL BADGE WITH A BULLETHOLE IN IT, LYING


On the floor.  She looks up to the sound of running, and 

sees a figure flitting across an opening.


ANGLE STARLING RAISES HER PISTOL AND PULLS THE TRIGGER.


Nothing happens.  She looks at the pistol.  It is jammed, 

she tries to clear it quickly, we see a hand on her shoulder, 

she turns.


ANGLE HER POV


It is the face of Lechter.


Starling raises the pistol and fires.  We see the pistol 

explode.


We hear screaming.


Angle int Starling's bedroom.  Starling, sitting up in bed, 

screaming.  Mapp burst in to the room.  Followed by her 

boyfriend, Jim, who carries a gun, and sweeps the room.  

Mapp sits by Starling.


She quiets Starling.


MAPP

What was it.

(starling shakes her 

head)

What was it, honey?


ANGLE XCU ON STARLING, WHO MUTTERS.


STARLING

...Something about my father...?


MAPP

...What?


STARLING

(as she shakes her 

head to clear it, 

and rises)

Do you think you could make a cup of 

coffee, cause I'm going to work.


ANGLE ON JIM.  HE LOOKS OUT THE WINDOW, AT THE DAWN.  HE


Looks at his watch, and at Mapp.  He shrugs.


INT. VERGER'S ROOM - NIGHT.


Verger's various video screens, showing half-seen pictures 

of Children playing.


VERGER

(to Cordell)

Show me the pigs.


Cordell comes and stands by the bed.  He picks up a telephone, 

and touches some buttons on the console.  We see one of the 

video screens come to life, and we see a barn, and a couple 

of ratty looking gentlemen with coffee cups.


VERGER

Good morning, gentlemen.


They tug their forelocks.


CORDELL

...May we see it, please?


GENTLEMAN

(with a thick mid-

European accent)

We have them trained the two things:  

to come on the whistle, and to attack 

the figurine.


We see the other gentlemen bring forward a scarecrow.


GENTLEMAN

...Can you see the pig...?


We see the camera scan, and we see two large wild boars in a 

pen.


We see the one man put the scarecrow over a fence.


GENTLEMAN

We stuff the figure with meat scraps, 

at first, of course, the pigs is...


VERGER

Do it...


CORDELL

...Let's see the pigs, please.


The Gentleman blows his whistle.  The pigs run at the figurine 

and stop.  We hear the sound of human screams.


GENTLEMAN

We tape the screams, to get them 

used to the

(he mumbles, looks to 

his friend for help)


SECOND GENTLEMAN

...Distraction.


GENTLEMAN

...As you recommend,

(shrugs)

I think they like it.  They will 

eventually.


VERGER

Make them eat the figurine.


GENTLEMAN

They will, sir.  We train them, to 

the figurine, eventually, they consume 

a man, say, 80 kilos, say, in...


VERGER

(to Cordell)

...Tell them...


CORDELL

We don't want the man consumed.  No.  

We want to put the man's feet through 

the bars, and have the pigs... And 

have the pigs eat his feet.


GENTLEMAN

(nods)

...They eat his feet...


VERGER

Yes.  It's all a question of bait--

isn't it...?


On the TV screen we see the pigs nosing the dummy.


VERGER

...Make them eat the dummy.


GENTLEMAN

...They eat the dummy, sir, they eat 

the man... I keep them hungry.  

When... When do we think this man 

arrives.


VERGER

Is it necessary to know?


GENTLEMAN

Well, I don't want to starve them 

too long.  They die.


VERGER

Oh, no, no.  It won't be that long.


The camera zooms in on the pigs.  In an upper screen we see 

a chicken wandering outside the pen.  The chicken wanders 

into the pen.  On the first screen we see one of the pigs 

turn, and run blindingly quickly across the enclosure, and 

in a cu we see the few feathers that are the remainder of 

the chicken.


ANGLE ON VERGER AND CORDELL.


VERGER

No, I don't think it will be too 

very long at all.

(to Cordell)

Please call our friend at the FBI.


Sound of a phone high speed dialed.


VERGER

(to phone)

Hello.  Do you know who this is?  I 

think it's time to finish the 

preparation of our friend.  Miss 

Starling.  I'm fine, how are you...?


INT. PSYCHIATRIST'S OFFICE - DAY.


Starling is talking to a kindly older woman Psychiatrist.


ANGLE INS.


Starling holds the card reading, "be kind, be happy."


ANGLE ON STARLING SPEAKING:


STARLING

...To, to... To be in control of 

my... my emotions.


PSYCHIATRIST

Yes, but no one is in control of 

their emotions.

(pause)

That's all we have time for today...

(she starts to rise)


STARLING

(pause)

I don't understand.


PSYCHIATRIST

You said:  that you have "decided." 

That your... Your feelings of 

persecution, as you put it are a 

"self-indulgence," and you are going 

to put them aside.  And get on with 

your job.


STARLING

That's right.


PSYCHIATRIST

And you have decided to accept... To 

accept this "emotion," as you put 

it, to the... The "sweepings".  Of 

the Lechter case.


STARLING

Yes.


PSYCHIATRIST

And you've decided to get married.

(pause)

You've decided a lot of things.

(pause)

But, in spite of your decisions--you 

are still "nagged" by feelings of:  

despair, of failure of... You still 

have the nightmare, you...


STARLING

What is your point?


PSYCHIATRIST

That if decision were a useful tool, 

you wouldn't be here.

(pause)

Why are you here...?


STARLING

I..


PSYCHIATRIST

...Yes...?


STARLING

(as she rises)

I want to do something positive...


PSYCHIATRIST

You want some advice.


STARLING

Yes.


PSYCHIATRIST

Your life has been defined by 

institutions.  The orphanage where 

you were raised, the FBI academy, 

the bureau.  If the institution is 

your life, accept it.  Ask to be 

reinstated on the "Drumgo" task force.  

Play their game.


STARLING

...Why?


PSYCHIATRIST

Because it's the game you've chosen.  

That's really all we have time for.


INT. ITALIAN POLICE DETECTIVE SQUAD HQ FLORENCE.


A hatrack with the "gimme" cap from the FBI international 

police academy on it.


Pazzi enters, and hangs his hat on the hatrack, he is speaking 

with his Superior.


PAZZI

...A liaison position...


SUPERIOR

And what does that mean?


PAZZI

...I feel that...


SUPERIOR

"a liaison position with the opera."

(pause)

The Superior takes Pazzi into a small 

office and closes the door.


SUPERIOR

Rinaldo, what happened to you?

(pause)

You want me to reach out for tickets 

to the opera.  Say so.  What is that 

Young girl doing to you...?


PAZZI

Could you get me tickets to the opera.


SUPERIOR

She must be something special after 

dark.


PAZZI

I can't remember.

(pause.  The Superior 

nods sagely)

I've got to make some money.


SUPERIOR

(picks up a file)

Thirty thousand dollars reward.  In 

the whereabouts of il Dottore Fanelli, 

or the apprehension of his...


PAZZI

...Yes, yes, yes...


He sighs, he takes the file, and leaves the office.


PAZZI

Could you help me with tickets to...


SUPERIOR

The short term problem is the tickets-- 

the long-term problem is your wife.


Pazzi shakes his head.


Angle Pazzi at his desk.  We see the file labelled:  

disappearance of Dottore Ennio Fanelli.


ANGLE PAZZI AT HIS DESK.


A Colleague comes by.


COLLEAGUE

Naldo, you want opera tickets...?


PAZZI

Can you help me?


COLLEAGUE

No, but I'm going.  If you like, 

I'll tell you what you missed.


The Colleague leaves.


The Superior returns.


SUPERIOR

And the related problem is your job.  

Aha.  And here it all comes together.  

To get a promotion you must keep 

your job.  To keep your job you must 

solve this case.  Solve the case, 

and the reward may help you keep 

your wife.  In short, the solution 

to all your problems lies in this 

file:  the disappearance of il Dottore 

Fanelli.


The Superior points to a file on Pazzi's desk.


Pazzi nods, and picks up the report.


ANGLE INS.  THE REPORT:


Identified by the following:  acute anesthesia or a hyper-

acute sense of smell.  Capable of distinguishing quantities 

of substance by smell.


ANGLE ON PAZZI


As he leafs through the report, wonderingly.


ANGLE INS, THE REPORT.


...Phenomenal capacity for languages.  Known perfect fluency 

in Russian, German, Spanish, French, and Italian.  In 

addition...

The report on the disappearance of Fanelli, still lying on 

the desk.  Angle, on the report he is holding, he turns to 

the cover, we read it is:  FBI international police academy.  

Case book.  The psychopathic killer.  #3:  Hannibal Lechter.


ANGLE ON PAZZI


At his desk.  He puts down the FBI report, and Picks up the 

Fanelli report, and leafs through it.


Angle ins:  his pov.  The report, we read: ...Apartment was 

untouched, showing no signs of his departure, hurried or 

otherwise.  Note:  his housekeeper did testify that "all the 

condiments had been removed from the kitchen," but this was 

discounted as fanciful and...


ANGLE ON PAZZI


As he puts down the report.


He looks at the two reports side by side, a colleague comes 

up behind him.


COLLEAGUE

Commendatore, if you're looking for 

opera tickets....


Pazzi waves him away, he opens his desk, and takes out an 

envelope of snapshots.  He leafs through them and we see 

Pazzi on the range at Quantico, in a classroom, in front of 

the lincoln memorial, and in front of the wanted poster, for 

Lechter.


ANGLE XCU


The number advertising a three million dollar reward.


ANGLE ON PAZZI


As he starts to pick up the phone, then hesitates.  He rises, 

and goes to the hatstand to take his hat.


EXT. FLORENCE STREET.


ANGLE INS.


The snapshot, the wanted poster, sound of a phone being 

dialed.


ANGLE PAZZI IN THE PHONEBOOTH.


We hear a recorded announcement:


We're sorry, this number is no longer in service.  If you 

feel you have dialed in error...


Pazzi hands up the phone.  He starts to walk away.  As he 

does so, the phone rings, he goes back to the telephone.


PAZZI

(on his phone)

Hello...?


VOICE ON PHONE

...What did you want?

(pause)


PAZZI

I know where he is.


VOICE ON PHONE

I'm sure I don't know who you mean.


PAZZI

I know where he is.


VOICE ON PHONE

And why should we believe you?


PAZZI

I know something no one knows.

(pause)

He has had his finger removed.  On 

his left hand.

(pause)

It left a scar.

ANGLE ON THE VIDEOS ABOVE VERGER'S BED.


They show the pigs being fed.


VERGER

Where was the call from.


CORDELL

Somewhere in Italy.


VERGER

Make plans for Lechter's abduction.


Cordell starts away, then turns back.


CORDELL

...Then we won't need to tether miss 

Starling as our lure.


VERGER

That operation has begun.  Are we 

god, that we would meddle with it...?  

No, on the other hand...


INT. OPERA HOUSE NIGHT.


Starling, dressed in finery.  She is watching a western ballet 

a la Agnes de Mille, the dancers are dressed in cowboy garb.


Next to her we see a very fat woman asleep.  Behind the old 

woman two Opera-goers are whispering their displeasure.


Starling exchanges a look with her date.  We do not see him, 

only her across his shoulder.  She looks down.


ANGLE HER POV


On the floor we see her feet and his feet in cowboy boots.


Starling bends down and retrieves a badge case, she opens it 

in the insert and reveals it is a watchman's badge with a 

hole in it, she hands the badge to the man, we see he holds, 

on his lap, a western hat, with a bullethole in the crown.


OPERAGOER

How can she sleep at a time like 

this?  How can she...


DISSOLVE TO:


INT. SWAT VAN


We see the swat Cops we saw in the first sequence.  They are 

stuffed into a van in full assault gear.  One of the Cops is 

talking about something just out of shot.


Taped to the wall of the van is a large grainy blowup of


Evelda Drumgo.


COP

...Sleep at a time like this...?


BRIGHAM

(also in assault gear)

She's resting.  She's conserving her 

strength, perhaps you should do the 

same.


We see he is talking about Starling who is, indeed, asleep, 

sitting in the van.


TEAM LEADER

Stand by.


Brigham nudges Starling, who wakes up.


ANGLE EXT THE VAN.


It is pulling up outside a fish market, alongside the river.  

Various workers are hosing down the fish on ice.  We see the 

van, a us postal service van, coming around the corner.


ANGLE INT THE VAN.


TEAM LEADER

...Starling...


He defers to her, she moves to the center of the crowded van 

and peeks through the periscope.


ANGLE HER POV


The scene just seen from outside the van.  A lowrider car 

pulling up.


STARLING

Yeah, it looks clear outside the... 

Wait a moment... We got... It's a 

gunship...


Brigham nudges her aside and looks through the eyepiece of 

the periscope.


He holds a short conversation with a walkie talkie.


BRIGHAM

Brigham.  Go.

(pause)

Affirmative.

(pause)

Okay, happiness is a green light.  

We've got Evelda in the kitchen, 

cooking.  The dope's D.E.A.

(he nods to one of 

the men in the van.)

We want her on interstate 

transportation of some firecrackers.  

Starling:  you've got Drumgo, you 

know her from before.


STARLING

I know her by the back.


BRIGHAM

...These guy'll back you up.


OFFICER

We're gonna be your couch potatoes.


STARLING

Pray that it may be so.  She will 

fight.  Last time, she had a nine 

mil, three magazines, mace in her 

purse, a razor round her neck, and a 

shank in her hair.  She will walk 

over you, you give her a chance.  

I'm gonna asker to give it up, she 

balks, I want some real help.  

Nevermind watching my back, I want 

some weight on her.


OFFICER

You got it.


TECHNICIAN

We've got some action, coming out of 

the building.

ANGLE ON THE RIVER.


A boat, cruising.


A swat Officer is talking on a walkie.


SWAT OFFICER

I've got you, three hundred yards 

from the factory.  We're going in 

the back door.


He looks out.


ANGLE, HIS POV.


Various small fish factory sheds, and we see the phone van, 

moving slowly, between them.


ANGLE IN THE VAN.


Starling moves to the back.  She is observing the street 

scene through the smoked glass in the rear of the van.


SWAT OFFICER

...How we looking back there?


ANGLE, STARLING'S POV


The fish stall, a worker, hosing down the iced fish.


We see a small metal door, in the side of the building open, 

and a heavyset man comes out, carrying a basket in his arms.


STARLING

Heads up!


ANGLE, STARLING'S POV.


He is followed by another man, carrying a raincoat, and we 

see a glimpse of a woman behind them.


BRIGHAM

(on the radio)

Strike one to all units;  Evelda 

Drumgo's coming out behind two 

shooters.  Showdown showdown showdown.  

Put em on the ground, as quietly as 

we can.  Boat's due in thirty seconds, 

let's do it.


ANGLE EXT THE VAN.


The swat team comes out, led by Starling.  Evelda steps from 

between the two men.


ANGLE, ON STARLING, AS SHE ADVANCES.


We see Brigham behind her.


BRIGHAM

...Make sure you...


Starling moves away from Brigham, toward Evelda and her goons 

as Starling advances we see Evelda beyond her, and that she 

carries a baby in a sling, in her arms.


STARLING

(to the men behind 

her)

Wait wait wait!


Starling carefully holsters her pistol and raises her hands.


STARLING

Evelda!  Give it up!  Come to me, 

baby!

(out of the side of 

her mouth, to the 

men behind her.)

...Give her a place to go... Give 

her a place to go... Come on Evelda.  

Nothing to it.  I swear to God.


We hear a squeal of tires.


ANGLE XCU ON STARLING


As her face screws up, and her head turns fractionally toward 

the direction of the sound.


STARLING

Ev...


Starling's eyes grow very wide.


ANGLE HER POV.


Evelda has produced a small smg from behind her babysling, 

and is spraying the street.


ANGLE, ON STARLING, AS SHE LOOKS AROUND.


Brigham fall, hit, by her side.  And several other swat 

members begin running for cover.  The man with the raincoat 

drops it, to reveal a sawed off shotgun.  He fires at 

Starling.  She goes down in the street.


ANGLE ON STARLING IN THE STREET.


As she picks herself up from the pavement, and crawls toward 

the safety of a parked car.


A cadillac sedan is coming down the street, the same apache 

style shooter we saw previously is shooting over the roof, 

at the police.  The car screeches into a fishtail, and Evelda, 

still shooting, get into the backseat.  The car burns rubber, 

trying to accelerate.


Starling emerges from her cover and fires at the car.  The 

windshield spatters, and a tire blows out.  The car crashes 

into a fish stall.


Sound of a helicopter.


Two shooters try to slither out of the crushed car.


Starling, advancing toward them, shoots them both.


ANGLE, HER POV.


Evelda, and the baby, in the backseat.  The baby crying.


Starling advances on them.


STARLING

(to the Cops)

Security security!  Watch the fish 

house door behind me.  Get my back.  

Evelda.  Evelda.  Put your hands out 

of the window.


ANGLE ON BRIGHAM, ON THE GROUND TWITCHING.


He is shaking his head, dazed.


STARLING

Evelda.  Show me your hands.  Come 

on.  Please.  Show me your hands.


ANGLE, ON EVELDA.


EVELDA

Well, it's you, chile.  It's my friend 

the orphan...


STARLING

Give it up, Evelda.


EVELDA

You said you din' have no friends--

but I'm your friend--I understand 

you...


STARLING

Think about the baby... Show me your 

hands... Evelda?  Show me your 

hands...


EVELDA

F'that's the thing to do...


She withdraws a hand from the babysling, showing a small 

pistol, which she levels at Starling.


ANGLE ON STARLING AS SHE FIRES AT EVELDA.


She runs forward, and takes the screaming baby from Evelda's 

arms.  The baby is covered in blood.


Starling runs to the still running hose which the fish worker 

dropped, and sluices down the baby.


Sound of helicopter.


ANGLE ON STARLING, AS SHE LOOKS UP.


ANGLE HER POV.


The helicopter shows a cameraman hanging out of the door on 

a sling, and the logo WCTU, TV 10.


ANGLE A TELEVISION SCREEN, SHOWING THE SHOT FROM THE 

HELICOPTER.


Screen bears the small logo, supered in the lower right


CORNER:

TV 10, News Live.


We see, from above, Starling, hosing down the baby, and 

walking into the middle of the street.  We hear the sound of 

an ambulance, and the helo shot shifts to an ambulance 

screaming around the corner.


ANGLE BACK ON THE STREET.


Starling, holding the baby, is walking through the scene of 

the carnage.  She sees Brigham, raising himself to an elbow, 

and he mouths, "I'm alright..."


Starling walks on, past the car, with the dead bodies.


Paramedics come out of the stopped ambulance, and one of 

them takes the infant from the dazed Starling.


Starling helps Brigham to his feet.  He stands woozily, he 

begins to unbuckle the kevlar protective vest he wears.


BRIGHAM

I...


STARLING

What, what, I can't hear you...


BRIGHAM

Are you alright...?


They are screaming over the sound of the helicopter.


STARLING

I almost shot the baby...


BRIGHAM

Who called the TV crews...?


ANGLE ON STARLING


Standing in the middle of the street.  Brigham calls another 

Cop over.


BRIGHAM

Sergeant...


An Officer, followed by another, comes up to Brigham.  The 

three advance toward the scene at the parked car.


Starling turns toward them.


STARLING

Security!!!


We see the second Officer pick up the shotgun from the arms 

of the "raincoat" man.


BRIGHAM

(turning back, to 

respond to Starling, 

he draws his hand 

across his throat)

They're dead... Standdown, it's alr...


ANGLE ON THE OFFICER PICKING UP THE SHOTGUN.  IT DISCHARGES.


ANGLE ON BRIGHAM, AS HE FALLS, FELLED BY THE SHOTGUN BLAST.


ANGLE ON STARLING, AS SHE TURNS, TO LOOK AT THE SCENE, OF 

THE DYING BRIGHAM.


She starts to take a step toward him, and stops.


She looks up at the helicopter.


ANGLE THE TV IMAGE


With the logo on it, we see it zoom in on Starling looking 

up, she then walks, dazedly, toward the obviously dead 

brigman, and sits, several feet from him.  We see several 

Officers coming forward toward her.


VERGER (V.O.)

...You forgot to cancel the plan.


Angle we see the television is in Verger's room, and we are 

shooting over Verger's form, we see the back of his head, 

and, beyond him, Cordell.


CORDELL

...Sir...?


VERGER

Waal, nobody's perfect... What do we 

hear from our songbird in switzerland?


INT. SWISS LAWYER'S OFFICE - DAY.


A jolly fat swiss Banker, smiling, a lovely heidi-esque 

mountain scene visible in the window behind him.


ANGLE ON PAZZI


Standing in front of a vault.  The vault is full of 

currency... A small clerktype, is finishing filling up a 

small valise with currency.  He glances at the fat Banker, 

and nods.


The fat Banker comes forward, and motions at the bag.


BANKER

One hundred thousand dollars, signori.  

The remainder of the three million.

(he motions to the 

vault)

Upon the person-in-question's 

apprehension.  Would you prefer a 

cheque...?


ANGLE ON PAZZI, GRINNING AT THE MONEY.


PAZZI

No, no thank you, I...


Pazzi glances back toward the door, closing on the vault.


PAZZI

...And the remainder, you said. ..?


BANKER

After you have, in the words of our 

friends, the americans, put him on 

the spot.


PAZZI

But is that necessary...


BANKER

(shrugs)

It is necessary, if you wish the 

remainder of the money.

(he nods to his clerk, 

who closes the door 

on the vault)

Shall we drive you to the airport...?


PAZZI

(still looking at the 

closing vault, shyly)

I... I thought I'd do some shopping...


INT. FLORENCE OPERAHOUSE - NIGHT.


Applause is dying out, the curtain is falling, spectators 

are standing to leave.


In the house, heads turn at the sight of a very beautiful 

woman.  It is mme Pazzi in a couture dress, and jewels 

backing.  She is accompanied by Pazzi, who is draping her 

shoulders in a furcoat.


Pazzi bows this way and that, to admiring couples, as they 

make their way up the aisle.


MRS. PAZZI

(to Pazzi)

...How can I thank you?


PAZZI

Ask me when we get home.


MRS. PAZZI

Oh, my program...


Pazzi turns back, he is walking against the press of exiting 

operagoers, and is having difficulty.


ANGLE ON DR. FELL, WHO IS WALKING TOWARD HIM.


FELL

Ah, commendatore... You, too, admire 

Mozart.


PAZZI

(pause)

Who does not?


FELL

If such there breathe, I'm sure you 

could unearth him...

(pause)

Your reputation does you honor.

(pause)


PAZZI

I've left my program...


FELL

Take mine.

(he hands his program 

to Pazzi, and they 

start up the aisle)

Ah. And is that your wife...

(they gain the side 

of Mme.  Pazzi.)

Signora.

(he bends to kiss her 

hand)

Can it be that you are lovelier, 

even, than at our last encounter...?


MRS. PAZZI

My Mother told me to ignore the 

blandishments of charming men.


FELL

Then, she, herself, possessed some 

knowledge of the greater world... 

How pleased am I to see you looking 

so well...


Pazzi is called away, by an exiting operagoer, and he leaves 

reluctantly, looking back, with apprehension, at Fell and 

his wife.


The two, chatting, join him.


FELL

Commendatore, your wife tells me you 

are taking her away on vacation.


PAZZI

...Long overdue.


FELL

(as they exit, onto 

the street in front 

of the opera, and 

many cars and limos, 

pulling up to receive 

the exiting, et 

cetera.)

Back to America...?

(pause)

(while Pazzi looks on 

with consternation)

When first we met you'd just returned 

from America.


MRS. PAZZI

How wonderful of you, to hold that 

information in your busy mind...


FELL

...How so?


MRS. PAZZI

...You told me you were studying for 

your examination by the studiolo...


FELL

And how good of you to remember it.  

Then, this trip, then, is not a return 

to America...


MRS. PAZZI

No, this is pleasure...


FELL

And what was the trip before...?


MRS. PAZZI

That, that was business...


Pazzi tries to maneuver his wife away from Fell.  Camera 

takes them around a corner, to a "no parking, loading zone,"


Sign, in which we see a police sedan, and one of Pazzi's 

men.  He is wearing the gimme hat Pazzi brought back from 

the states.


ANGLE ON FELL, AS HE LOOKS OVER AT THE DRIVER.


ANGLE HIS POV.


The hat, "FBI International Police Academy, Quantico 

Virginia."


The driver takes off the hat, and opens the door to the sedan 

for the Pazzis.


ANGLE, ON FELL, AS HE TAKES HIS LEAVE.


FELL

Business.  Yes.  How much better.  

To travel for the pure enjoyment of 

the thing, of the variety of the 

world....Yes...

(pause)

Just to get away.

(pause)

I'm surprised they can spare you, in 

the midst of your investigation.

(pause, Pazzi looks 

back)

Of the disappearance of my 

predecessor...


ANGLE, AS MRS. PAZZI PULLS PAZZI INTO THE CAR.


MRS. PAZZI

(whispering to him)

Take me home and make love to me...


ANGLE, ON FELL


As Pazzi waves to him, through the car window glass, and the 

car pulls away, leaving Fell standing in the alleyway.  Beat.  

He nods, as if confirming something to himself.


He starts back out of the alleyway, into the press of 

humanity.


MAN'S VOICE (V.O.)

Time to get something to eat...


ANGLE XCU ON FELL AS HE LOOKS AFTER THE DEPARTING CAR.


FELL

(to himself)

Yes, quite...


ANGLE, THE MAN SPEAKING TURNS, AND IS STARTLED TO SEE FELL.


MAN

I beg your pardon.


FELL

You suggested it was time to get 

something good to eat.


MAN

I thought that you were...

(he sees another man 

approaching him)

Ah!  Where shall we eat...?

(the two walk off)


FELL

(to himself)

...Where shall we eat.  And what 

shall we eat.


INT. PAZZI'S APARTMENT.


Half seen, through a panning shot of a halfopen door, Pazzi 

and his wife making love.  We hear Pazzi calling:


PAZZI

...Laura... Laura... Laura...


ANGLE ON FELL, IN THE SHADOWS


As he closes the front door soundlessly behind him.  He stands 

for a moment, looking, camera then takes him into the 

apartment where he finds the kitchen.


INT. THE KITCHEN


Fell takes a knife from a maple block, tries its edge, 

replaces it, takes out a cleaver, and nods.  He looks above, 

and takes down a Copper saucepan from the pot rack.  He opens 

the refrigerator, glances briefly inside, and nods, in 

satisfaction, and closes it.


He picks up a dishtowel, tries it between his hands, testing 

its strength.


He puts it down, dissatisfied.


He begins to prowl through the apartment, he passes another 

half open door, and we see Pazzi and his wife, half glimpsed, 

beyond, Fell moves into a small study.


ANGLE


The back of the desk chair, holds a man's sportcoat, and a 

tie.


Fell moves toward the chair, puts his cleaver down on the 

desk, and tries the tie between his hands, testing his 

strength.


He nods, satisfied, and picks up the cleaner.


ANGLE INS THE CLEANER


Which is laying on top of the file regarding the disappearance 

of Dottore Fanelli, beneath it, half covered, is the FBI 

logo.


We see Fell's hand raise the first file, to look at the 

second, and we read: "FBI Report, The Psychopathology, etc, 

of Hannibal Lechter."


ANGLE CU.


On Fell, as he nods to himself, he then looks down at 

something else.


ANGLE HIS POV.


A scarf, peeping out of the half-open desk drawer.


ANGLE INS.


Fell's hand draws out the scarf.  Nestled in the scarf is 

the photo of Pazzi in front of the wanted poster.


ANGLE ON FELL AS HE LOOKS AT THE PICTURE.


He then begins to peer very closely at it.  He picks up the 

magnifying glass from the desk, and we see, in a huge insert, 

that he is moving the magnifying glass to attempt to make 

out the figure reflected in the glass covering the wanted 

poster, ID, the figure of the photographer, is Starling.


ANGLE XCU INS THE JUST SEEN OUTLINE OF STARLING, HOLDING THE 

CAMERA.


Angle Fell, looking at the photo.  He then glances at the 

scarf, picks it up, and, questioningly, sniffs it once, and 

then again.  He holds the scarf to his face.  He rubs it 

between his hands, and smells his hands.


Angle Pazzi bedroom.


MRS. PAZZI

...And then, we're going to Greece...


PAZZI

Yes, but the important thing, as 

I've said...


MRS. PAZZI

...Get me a cigarette.


Pazzi gets up from the bed, and wraps himself in a sheet, 

and proceeds into the study.


PAZZI

The essential thing.  The essential 

thing, is that we must be absolutely 

quiet about...


He pulls open the desk drawer, and takes out a pack of 

cigarettes.


He looks wonderingly, at the drawer, beat.  He shrugs, he is 

about to start back into the bedroom, he glances at the 

curtains, blowing in the open window, hesitates.


MRS. PAZZI

...What is it?


He looks into the desk, shakes his head.  Beat.


And then returns into the bedroom.


MRS. PAZZI

...You've forgotten the cigarettes.


Pazzi turns, and looks back toward the open window, and the 

blowing shades.


EXT. FLORENTINE PARK - NIGHT.


A young woman walks past the camera.  She takes us to Fell, 

who is sitting across from the statue of the lion and the 

bird, he is picking his teeth, and, very delicately, takes 

out a scarf, and wipes his mouth.  We see it is the scarf 

which he stole from Pazzi, he takes out the photograph of 

the wanted poster, and looks at it, as he walks through the 

park.


Camera takes him out of the park, past the young woman, who, 

we see, has returned to a stroller, which is empty, she is 

talking to a uniformed policeman, and gesturing, "about this 

high..."  Showing the height of her child.  He and the woman 

start looking in the bushes.


ANGLE ON FELL


Leaving the park, he walks past an appliance store, in the 

window of which we see, ten silent TV screens, and a Talking 

head announcer.


The scene shifts to the helicopter footage of Starling.


We see photos displayed of Starling, next to the people she 

shot in the shootout, and a visbo proclaims, "Killer of five, 

the death angel: Clarice Starling."


EXT. STARLING'S HOUSE - DAY


Starling, Mapp, and Jim, Mapp's boyfriend, are coming out of 

the house with Crawford, escorted toward several cars of 

what is obviously a funeral cortege.


A sedan pulls up, and Krendler gets out.


KRENDLER

I came to pay my...


STARLING

...Get outta my way, you 

sonofabitch...


KRENDLER

I realize, you're under a lot of...


STARLING

You put my friend in the ground, 

with your mickeymouse taskforce...  

Izsat the kind of headlines that 

preserve and promote, you, sir?


She starts pushing him, and camera pans, to a group of 

newsvans, cordoned off, around the corner, and held in bay 

by various police.  Starling is being subdued by Crawford et 

al.


STARLING

(as she pushes at 

Krendler)

Izzat the kind of publicity will aid 

our run for congress?  You swine, 

you...


KRENDLER

(shrieking at her)

You're out she's out...


She is being dociled, and led away.


KRENDLER

(shouting after her)

You country cornpone bitch--hey, you 

trailer trash bitch, you still looking 

for your daddy, beat you up, to show 

he loves you?


ANGLE


On Starling, standing by the line of cars.  She sees 

something, and turns.


ANGLE XCU


Starling as she looks.  Krendler continues his harangue.


ANGLE HER POV.


On the rear deck of a car, a stetson hat, with a bullet 

through it, and an old square policebadge, with a bullethole 

through it .


KRENDLER (V.O.)

Looking for your daddy, fuck you and 

mark you up, an...


ANGLE ON STARLING 


As she blinks, and shakes her head to clear it.


The sedan drives off, as she strains to look after it.


KRENDLER

Well, here I am, you...


Starling shakes her head again, finds herself facing Krendler, 

and punches him in the stomach.  Krendler goes down.  Starling 

is subdued by her comforters.  She strains to look after the 

departing car.


INT. VERGER'S ROOM.


On the TV Starling, being pulled off of Krendler.


ANGLE, OVER VERGER, ONTO CORDELL.


VERGER

Quod videt monumentum, circumspice.  

Need I translate?


CORDELL

If you would see him monument, look 

around you.


VERGER

Show me the pigs.


The videoscreen changes, to show the pigs, attacking the 

dummy man.


CORDELL

Telephone call.  From Switzerland, 

sir.


Verger converses in German, with the Swiss.  He is told that 

they can have a date, and that a package will be coming his 

way soon.


ANGLE.  ON VERGER, LOOKING AT THE PIGS.


EXT. FLORENTINE PALAZZO - NIGHT.


Pazzi, walking down the street.  Nervously adjusts his scarf.


ANGLE A BRIGAND


Lounging by a van, nods imperceptibly, at Pazzi, who continues 

walking.


The brigand goes into the back of the van.


ANGLE INT THE VAN.


There is another brigand inside.  There are several firearms


In a rack, and a hospital gurney with heavy restraints.  The 

second brigand is loading an odd looking shoulder weapon.


SECOND BRIGAND

I hit him with the beanbag gun, you 

stand by:  he's still flopping...


The first brigand nods, and takes a capped hypodermic syringe 

from the second man.


SECOND BRIGAND

Just make sure he's alive, because 

I've already spent the bonus...


The fruit man nods to the second, and we see Pazzi proceeding 

up the stairs into the palazzo.


INT. A SALON AT THE PALAZZO - NIGHT.


A worker is moving a floor polisher across the marble floor 

of the salon, in an anteroom beyond we hear Fell lecturing.  

The worker nods differentially, at someone off screen.


We see he has nodded at Pazzi, who takes us to the door of 

the salon.


He wipes his hands nervously, he mops his brow, he looks at 

his watch.


He looks into the salon.


ANGLE HIS POV


Fell, in front of a lectern.  A slide machine is showing a 

painting of a hanged figure on a huge dropcloth at the back 

of the salon.


ANGLE, ON PAZZI


As he moves to the side, ie, out of the doorway to the salon, 

he glances over his shoulder, to make sure he is out of the 

sight of the workman with the floor polisher.  He sees the 

workman turn the polisher off and begin coiling the long 

electric cord.  Pazzi takes a small flat automatic from a 

hip holster.  Checks the chamber, and slips it into his jacket 

pocket.  He proceeds back to the doorway, where we and he 

see Fell, beyond, lecturing to a company of six men, in the 

salon.


FELL

(lecturing)

Della Vigna was disgraced and blinded 

for his betrayal of his emperor's 

trust--through avarice.  Avarice and 

hanging

(he gestures to the 

painting)

Are linked in the ancient and the 

medieval mind.


ANGLE ON PAZZI




As Hannibal (Fell) speaks, he moves to window, and wipes his 

hand again, and we see him look down at the van in the street, 

and wipe his hands, much of this speech plays as voice-over 

as he does so.


FELL

Judas and Pier Ddella Vigna are linked 

in Dante by the avarice he saw in 

them, and their subsequent deaths by 

hanging.  Ah commendatore Pazzi...


ANGLE ON FELL, AS HE SPEAKS TO PAZZI, HALF-SEEN IN THE 

DOORWAY.


FELL

You are welcome.  Since you are 

closest to the door, would you close 

the door, to improve the quality of 

the image.

(Pazzi does so)

You will be interested in this, 

commandatore, as there are two Pazzi's 

already in Dante's inferno...


ANGLE ON FELL


As he walks forward, between the chairs of the six old men 

(the studiolo) who sit listening to his lecture.  A few take 

notes.


FELL

(to the old men)

Camicion de Pazzi, as you know, 

murdered a kinsman, and rests in 

hell awaiting the arrival of a second 

Pazzi.  But it's not you:  it's 

Carlino, who will rest forever in 

hell for the crime of treachery.


ANGLE XCU, ON FELL, LOOKING AT PAZZI.


ANGLE ON PAZZI, UNDER THE WITHERING STARE.  BEAT.


FELL

(as he continues back 

to his lectern)

Avarice, and hanging, then.

(he gestures to the 

photograph of the 

painting)

On the next occasion, you might like 

to discuss the matter of chewing.  

Chewing in Dante:  Count Ugolino, 

chewing the back of the archbishop's 

head--Satan, with his three faces, 

chewing Judas, Brutus, and Cassius...  

All three traitors.  Is it not?  

Thank you all for your kind attention.


The scholars applaud him, two stand, and take him by the 

hand.


ANGLE ON PAZZI AT THE DOOR


He opens the door, and the old men of the studiolo exit, 

chattering happily about the lecture.  Fell comes out, the 

last of the salon.


FELL

Would you say that I've preserved my 

job, commendatore?


PAZZI

I'm not a scholar, Dottore.  But it 

seemed as if they, as if they...


FELL

Yes, I think I amused them.  To what 

do I owe...?


PAZZI

I require...


FELL

...Yes, yes, yes...


He follows Fell back into the room, where Fell begins putting 

away his material in the d1rty salon.


FELL

...The effects of my predecessor.


PAZZI

I'd like to walk home with you, and...


FELL

Yes, of course, and we'll collect 

them.  I won't be a minute...


ANGLE ON PAZZI AS HE WALKS UP TOWARD FELL.


He puts his hand in the jacket pocket.


ANGLE INS THE HAND


Seen through the cloth, gripping the automatic pistol.


ANGLE ON FELL


As he begins to pack up the slide projector, and then 

hesitates.


FELL

Ah, no.  I should have shown them 

this one..

(he takes out a slide 

and puts it in the 

projector)

This one will interest you:  let me 

see if I can improve the focus...


We see the image of a hanged man appear on the dropcloth.


There is a plaque draped around the neck of the hanged man.


FELL

Can you make it out, can you make 

out the name on the plaque?


Fell walks up to the image displayed on the dropcloth, Pazzi 

walks behind him.


FELL

(looking at the image)

It says Pazzi.  Pazzi.  And a rude, 

a very rude poem, this is your 

ancestor.  Francesco, hanging outside 

the palazzio Vecchio.  Outside these 

very windows.


He turns and fixes Pazzi with his gaze.


ANGLE, FELL


His face seen in the dark, in the beam of the slide projector.


HOLD.


FELL

On a related subject Signor Pazzi, I 

must confess to you:  I'm giving 

serious thought to eating your wife.


Fell jerks the drop cloth down over the two of them.


ANGLE XCU


On Pazzi's face as he sees the cloth coming down.


ANGLE INS HIS HAND


Going into his pocket, as he tries to bring out the pistol.


ANGLE ON THE FACE OF FELL


As he advances, under the cloth.


On Pazzi, Fell takes a small sponge and a bottle from his 

pocket, and dumps liquid from the bottle onto the sponge, 

and grabs Pazzi by the hair, puts him into a chokehold, and 

holds the sponge to Pazzi's face.


ANGLE EXT


The dropcloth, as we see the effects of the struggle, and 

hear the small pistol going off.


ANGLE EXT THE PALAZZO.


The last member of the studiolo, coming out, a workman follows 

him, and begins locking the door.


ANGLE ON THE BRIGANDS


At their van, they look at each other, one checks his watch.


ANGLE INT THE SALON.


The floor polisher.  Moving, as if of its own volition, across 

the floor.


ANGLE ON PAZZI


Tied to the podium, his mouth gagged.


ANGLE ON LECHTER


As he coils up the long orange cord of the floor polisher, 

drawing it toward him.


FELL

Yes.  Your wife.  Laura.  L'orange, 

which is the topnote of her skin, 

wouldn't you say?  Or do I grow too 

personal?  But that is what I think 

of, when I think of her.  And how 

could I but think of her?  I haven't 

had a bite all day.  The kidney and 

the liver would be suitable for a 

dinner tonight.  But the rest of the 

meat should hang for a week, in these 

cool conditions.  Wouldn't you say?  

Nod once for yes.

(pause)

If you tell me what I need to know, 

then it would be convenient for me 

to leave without my meal.  And Mrs. 

Pazzi will remain unscathed.  I'll 

out the questions to you, and we'll 

see:  I saw at the theatre you had 

betrayed me.  And, when the police 

didn't come, it was clear you had 

sold me out.  Was it to Mason Verger?  

Blink one for yes.


ANGLE ON PAZZI.


Beat.  Then he blinks once.


FELL

Thank you.  And now:  are his hit 

men waiting outside?

(pazzi blinks once)

Was that a single blink?  Yes.  Thank 

you.


Fell finishes his coiling of the rope, and we see he has 

fashioned a hangman's noose.


Fell takes out a stiletto, and it opens.  He advances toward 

Pazzi, who tries to recoil.


FELL

No, no.  I'm going to take the tape 

off.  Please do not scream.  Do you 

think you can keep from screaming?

(he takes the tape 

off)

...Would it help if I were to cut 

your bowels out...?


We see him make a swipe and hear Pazzi start to scream.


From outside the window of the salon, we see Pazzi, taped to 

the podium, being impelled, screaming, toward the window.


ANGLE ON THE LIGHTED PIAZZA OF THE PALAZZO


Tourists look up at the screaming.


Beat.


ANGLE XCU


On the contorted face of Pazzi, looking down, an orange noose 

around his neck, as the podium tilts through the open window.


ANGLE THE TWO BRIGANDS AT THE VAN.


Reaction to the sound of the screaming, run around the corner.  

They look up to see Pazzi, still tapes to the podium, hanging 

by the orange cord.


ANGLE, ON THE VILLAINS


Standing underneath, as gouts of blood fall on them.


BRIGAND ONE

...Cover the backdoor.  If he comes 

out, kill him.


BRIGAND TWO

...The bonus was for...


BRIGAND ONE

Kill him, and cut him.


He runs to the front of the palazzo, holding his shoulder 

arm down alongside his side.


He runs past the locked front door, and toward an alleyway.


We hear the sirens of police cars.  Brigand one slows his 

walk, and proceeds into the alleyway.  He sees a small door, 

in the side of the palazzo, and a light beyond.


ANGLE INT THE DOOR.


A small staircase.  The brigand enters, he looks up.


We hear the sound of rapidly descending footsteps.  The 

brigand mounts the steps, holding his rifle before him.  The 

sound of the footsteps continues.


On the second floor, the brigand shelters himself in a room, 

off the landing.  The sound of the descending footsteps 

continues.


ANGLE ON THE BRIGAND


Hiding behind the door.  Then he turns his head.


ANGLE, HIS POV.


We are in a laundry room.


The sound of the footsteps is, in fact, a clothesdryer.  In 

its glass door in the side, we see a man's shoe going around.


ANGLE THE BRIGAND, AS HE LOOKS, THEN TO THE SIDE.


ANGLE, HIS POV


In the side of the room, the legs of a dead man protrude 

from a clothes hamper, he wears only one shoe.


ANGLE XCU


On the brigand, as he turns.


ANGLE OVER HIM WE SEE HANNIBAL, SMILING, AS HE ADVANCES.


ANGLE ON THE STILETTO, AS IT ENTERS THE BRIGAND'S BELLY.


ANGLE EXT THE PALAZZO.


Several cop cars pulling up, an ambulance, a news truck.


A boy on a moto.


HANNIBAL

Young man...


The boy turns.  Hannibal is standing next to him.


HANNIBAL

Young man, I am desperate.  If I am 

not at the piazza Bellosguardo in 

ten minutes, it is the end of 

marriage.

(he hands a bundle of 

notes toward the boy)

Do you think you could help me...?


ANGLE IN THE PIAZZA


The body of Pazzi is being lowered, in the bg we see Hannibal, 

riding on the back of the moto, and away.


INT. VERGER'S ROOM - NIGHT.


A small Child is eating popcorn out of a crockery bowl.  We 

see his face, smiling, in the glow of a television.


ANGLE OVER VERGER AND THE CHILD.


VERGER

...How do you like it?


CHILD

It's real funny.


Cordell comes up holding a phone.  Beat.


VERGER

Tell me the good news.


CORDELL

He escaped...


VERGER

Have the child taken to bed.


CHILD

I wanna see more...


Cordell pushes a button on his console, and we see, on the 

video, monitors, a nurse leaving the hallway and entering 

Verger's room.  As Cordell takes the child to her we see 

that Verger and the child have been watching the pigs attack 

the man-sized dummy, which they now do with alacrity.


CORDELL

What do you want me to do?


VERGER

Follow Starling, stake out Starling.  

Increase the pressure on Starling.  

He will come to her.


INT. STARLING'S HOME - DAY.


Starling is sitting, affectless, in front of a full cup of 

coffee at her kitchen table.


Crawford sits opposite her.


CRAWFORD

And I brought this for you...


STARLING

What is it?


He produces a shoebox, she opens it, it contains various 

memorabilia of Brigham.  A photo of him in the army, two 

service pistols, his badge.


CRAWFORD

Out of John Brigharn's locker...


She nods.


CRAWFORD

Waal...


STARLING

I know you did what you could.


He shrugs.  She starts to walk her out.


CRAWFORD

I'm going to work for your 

reinstatement...


STARLING

Reinstatement to what?  There ain't 

nobody there...


He opens the door, and they are assaulted by flashbulbs, and 

a scad of newspeople, who have broken the bonds, and are 

pushing her up to the front door.


NEWSIE

Starling, Agent Starling:  what do 

you have to say to the new 

accusations...?


STARLING

New...?


NEWSIE

You've been accused of...


ANGLE, TELEVISION SET, TRAVEL OFFICE DAY.


It shows Starling, being hounded by the Newsies.


NEWSIE

...Leaking information to the press, 

which resulted in the botched...


ANGLE, THE STRICKEN FACE OF STARLING.


SECOND NEWSIE

Agent Starling:  what was your 

reaction to your indictment...?


BRIGHAM

...Indictment...?


SECOND NEWSIE

The district attorney today...


Starling and Crawford look at each other.  He shepherds her 

back into the house.


ANGLE A DISGUISED HANNIBAL LECHTER


Got up as a retiree, is sitting in an english travel Agent's 

office.  Posters of tours on the wall, a sign reading 

'Brittours.'  An old travel Agent is filling out forms.


TRAVEL AGENT

Majorca, Greece... Oh, aaand turkey...  

Mr. Bates, you're treating yourself 

to a holiday you'll remember for...


She looks up, to see Hannibal, looking at the television.


ANGLE HIS POV


The stricken face of Starling, as she is shephearded back 

into her house.  A Talking head comes on and speaks with a 

british accent.


TALKING HEAD

Of the american FBI Agent, Clarice 

Starling, shown here, in her dramatic 

gun battle, last week, with...


The footage comes on of the gun battle.


TRAVEL AGENT

Mr. Bates...?  Mr. Bates...?


TALKING HEAD

Dismissed from the FBI, she, it seems, 

is under criminal indictment for...


ANGLE ON HANNIBAL, AS HE TURNS BACK.


HANNIBAL

Could I, do you believe, change my 

destination...?


TRAVEL AGENT

Well... Well... What did you have in 

mind...?


INT. FBI HEADQUARTERS - DAY


Crawford and Krendler both looking at CNN.


CNN NEWSIE

(as we see another 

replay of the shootout)

...Criminal indictment... In quite a 

surprising move, against Agent, that 

is, former Agent...


ANGLE ON CRAWFORD


As he looks at Krendler, snorts in disgust, and walks away.


INT. VERGER'S ROOM - DAY.


Sound of a ringing phone.  Cordell comes over and hooks it 

up for Verger


CORDELL

...It's the F.B.I.


VERGER

Yes.  Good.  No.  He will come.  He 

will come.  Do not let up on our 

angel Starling.  No.  Now you must 

keep a constant watch on her.  Use 

your toys--a transmitter in her car, 

a... Keep her in your sight...  Do 

not let up, and he will come back 

for the wounded bird.

(pause)

He will find a way.


ANGLE.  HIS POV.  THE TELEVISION SET.


A wild boar thrashing himself against his bars.


ANGLE


On another screen, the scene from a wider angle, we see his 

keeper, holding a slab of raw meat, and waving it at the 

boar, just beyond the bars.  The boar throws himself against 

the bars, and the man recoils, and retires with the meat.


INT. JETLINER TOURIST SECTION - NIGHT.


A fat man wearing a Brittours button, comes down the aisle, 

holding a plastic cup full of beer.


He moves slowly through the full aisle, some passengers 

standing, chatting the others up.  The Stewardess, 

distributing minute plastic containers of foods.  Hold on 

his button, which he walks into close up.


It reads:  Bbrittours, Canada, US, Mexico, Peru!  Hi. My 

name is Phil!


ANGLE ON A YOUNG WOMAN ASLEEP


A baby at her breast.  The Stewardess comes by offering the 

sandwiches, she is shhhshed by the old man sitting next to 

the young Mother, he indicates "she is sleeping," she offers 

the sandwiches to the man (Dr. Lechter) and he declines.


The distracted Stewardess passes him one in any case.


He takes it, and puts it next to a magazine he is reading.


He sighs, he turns out his light, and pulls down the shade.  

Leaning over the sleeping form of a young boy who has the 

window seat.


Hannibal reaches out his travel bag from under his seat, and 

removes a half-bottle of wine, and a tin of pate.  He looks 

around to see he is unobserved.  He looks back.


ANGLE INS.


The young boy has shifted, and his arm lies across the tin 

of pate.  Hannibal's hand picks up the young boy's arm.


ANGLE XCU.


Hannibal looking at the arm.


ANGLE HIS POV.


His hand, circling the skinny arm.


INT. BOMBED OUT BUILDING - DAY


Seen through a snowy window.


A young tattered girl, her arm held by a vast soviet soldier, 

in a filthy uniform.


He nods to a group of five of the comrades, who are standing 

around a fire, made in the corner of the building.


One man enters bearing wood, and stacks it next to the fire, 

he smiles over at the girl and licks his lips.


The man holding the girl extracts a very worn and shiny 

bayonet from his belt scabbard, and starts dragging the girl 

away.


Sound of screams.


ANGLE EXT THE BURNTOUT BUILDING.


A young boy, in the shadows, shivering, watching the scene.


ANGLE HIS POV.


The soldier, leading the young girl off, sounds of screams.


YOUNG GIRL

Let go, let go, let go.


ANGLE ON HANNIBAL IN THE PLANE 


The woman next to him is hissing:


YOUNG MOTHER

What are you doing to my son?  Let 

him go!


The Stewardess comes up.


YOUNG MOTHER

He's... What is he doing to my son?


HANNIBAL

I beg your pardon, Madame, I was 

replacing his...


He moves to put the boys arm back, and his eyes meet the 

boy's.


ANGLE, THE BOY CU


Staring at Hannibal.


ANGLE CU.


Hannibal, staring at the boy.


HANNIBAL

(to the two women)

I was trying...


STEWARDESS

...He was trying not to wake him.


HANNIBAL

I beg your pardon, if I caused you 

any consternation.


The woman gives him a "don't do it again," look, and turns 

back to her now bawling infant.


Hannibal turns back to look at the somber boy.  Beat.  Of 

his delicacies.


HANNIBAL

...Would you like some...?


He starts to open the tin.


ANGLE ON THE BOY


Who looks at the tin, and then over at his mother.


HANNIBAL

(as he interprets the 

boy's look)

Your Mother would disapprove.  Of 

your taking food from a stranger.

(pause.  The boy nods)

Ah.  But she's asleep...

(the boy sees the 

logic of the argument, 

and smiles.  Hannibal 

begins to open the 

tin.  as he leans in 

toward the boy, 

conspiratorially)

And it's important, as I'm sure she's 

said, to eat new things!


XCU ON HANNIBAL SMILING AT THE CHILD


HANNIBAL

(to himself)

So important...


EXT. FARM AREA.  VERGER ESTATE - DAY. 


The romping kids, playing with the goat.  Camera goes with 

Cordell, who waves at the children and the nurses.


ANGLE, A GARAGE


A potatochip van.  As Cordell approaches, two men in 

potatochip delivery uniforms descend from the van.


Cordell approaches them, and hands them each a couple of 

sheets of paper.


He converses with them, while the nurse and the kids and the 

goats frolic in the foreground.


ANGLE INT THE VAN.


The two men, as they close the doors, and start off.  We see 

them as they pull out, we see Cordell walking through the 

stable area.  We see the van slide through the Verger estate 

toward the old gatehouse.


On the dashboard, one has spread one of the sheets of paper, 

and we see it is of Starling, the next sheet in an old photo 

of Hannibal.


MAN ONE

...Be easier if we just kill him.


MAN TWO

Be easier on everyone but us...


The other man nods his agreement.


EXT. PIG AREA - DAY


Two boars go insane at the advent of Cordell.  We see him 

through the stout bars of their enclosure.


Camera takes him into the pigbarn, where the gentleman, their 

trainer, is seen constructing a new enemy.


GENTLEMAN

(looking up at Cordell)

It's going to be long...?


Cordell shrugs


GENTLEMAN

Is going to be much longer, we should 

feed them...


CORDELL

Mmm.  Is it going to work?


The Gentleman moves to a tape player, and turns it on, and 

we hear a scream.  He nods and turns it off.


GENTLEMAN

The problem, if it is:  the tape is 

not the true scream, an' the dummy, 

of course, is not the true man.  

But.  Yes, yes, I think, is close 

enough...


CORDELL

So:  the two problems are:  they 

should be fed, and they should 

practice on a real...


The Gentleman turns his back on Cordell and is moving the 

tape machine.


ANGLE ON THE GENTLEMAN, WITH CORDELL BEHIND HIM.


GENTLEMAN

Yes.  You could say, that the two, 

the two prob...


ANGLE XCU ON THE GENTLEMAN


As he turns to camera, looking at Cordell, he opens his mouth 

to scream.


ANGLE EXT PLAY AREA.


The Children with the goat, playing, we hear a brief, far 

off scream.


Two children look at each other, pause, shrug, and go back 

to their game.


INT. STARLING'S BEDROOM - DAY.


Starling, dishevelled, sitting on her bed.  In the dark room.


She is looking at a photo of the Texan and the little girl.


ANGLE


The shoebox, holding Brigham's memorabilia, Starling's hand 

drags it across the bed.


ANGLE ON STARLING


As she takes out Brigham's credentials and badge holder.


She looks at his photo on the credentials.  Looks at his 

photo in the Marines, looks at the photo of the Texan and 

the little girl.  She takes Brigham's USMC hatbadge, the 

eagle and fouled anchor, and looks at it, and puts it in her 

pocket.


She takes out Brigham's service pistol, drops the mag, checks 

the chamber.


MAPP (V.O.)

Sad day.


STARLING

...What...?


MAPP

N'not that sad.


ANGLE ON STARLING


Looking at Mapp, who has just entered the room.


MAPP

Problem with suicide, y'know what 

they say?


STARLING

No.


MAPP

Every suicide kills two.


STARLING

Yeah.  Well.  They're a talkative 

buncha commentators.


MAPP

You got a lot of people love you, 

Starling.


STARLING

Trouble is, they all seem to die.


MAPP

Y'want to gimme Brigham's pistol?


STARLING

What would you guess, Ardelia?


MAPP

You goin to shoot yourself?

(pause)

Mapp shrugs, gets up, goes to the 

door, turns back.


MAPP

Don't shoot yourself.


STARLING

Why?


MAPP

Cause I'm tired, cleaning up after 

you.

(Starling gives a wan 

grin)

Why dontcha gimme the gun?


Starling shakes her head.


MAPP

Gimme the rounds...


Starling thinks, hands her the magazine and the spare round.


MAPP

Whyn'tcha go see that headshrinker 

nobody knows you're seeing...?  N'you 

make her earn her keep...


Starling sighs, and rises from the bed.


MAPP

(exiting.}


...You brush your hair first...


EXT. STARLING'S APARTMENT BUILDING - DAY


Starling exits, the street is quiet, across the street.  An 

old man is finishing loading his old push-mower onto the 

back of a truck.


Starling walks to her car, and gets in.


ANGLE INT THE POTATOCHIP VAN.


The two men in front.  One nods to the other, they take off, 

moving past the old lawncare man and his truck.


INT. PSYCHIATRIST'S OFFICE - DAY.


The box of tissues.  A hand takes a tissue.


ANGLE STARLING


Having taken the tissue, sitting across from the kindly old 

Psychiatrist.


PSYCHIATRIST

(checking her notes}


...The dream of your father.


Starling dabs her eyes with the tissue.  Shakes her head.


PSYCHIATRIST

Well, you're a courageous woman.  

Have courage, and tell me.


STARLING

He was shot... He was shot.  On his 

rounds.  And... And...


PSYCHIATRIST

That's when you went to the 

orphanage...


EXT. PSYCHIATRIST'S OFFICE. PARKING LOT - DAY.


Starling's car.


The lawnmower man's truck pulls up next to it.  We see the 

old man hobble out, and proceed to Starling's traversed door, 

he takes out a pick and picks the lock.


ANGLE INT THE CAR.


We see that it is Lechter.  He puts his face on the leather-

covered steering wheel, and smells the aroma.  He smiles.  

He takes a small package from the bosom of his overalls.  We 

see it is a bunch of violets.  He takes the scarf off his 

neck, and wraps them around the violets, and places the 

bouquet on the dashboard.


He sits in the car.


He gets out, and we see him go to the tailbed of his truck 

and begin to remove the lawnmower.


INT. PSYCHIATRIST'S OFFICE - DAY.


Starling, a tissue to her face.


STARLING

And all he left us:  the country 

brought back his hat, and his badge...  

Both with a bullethole in them.  An' 

that's what he left us.  That's what 

I said.


PSYCHIATRIST

And you have been dreaming... Dreaming 

about this hat, and...


STARLING

(waves her off, as if 

this is not the 

important point)

And.  I always said, he was a p'lice 

Officer.


PSYCHIATRIST

...Yes...?


STARLING

But.  He was a night watchman.  That's 

what he was.  N'they brought back, 

his hat, his badge, an his timeclock.

(she laughs)

N'then they took me off.

(the Psychiatrist 

makes a note)

I saw... I saw.  Clear as day, do 

you, do they call it a delusion?  

His hat an his badge.  Clear as day, 

bulletholes and all.


PSYCHIATRIST

When?


STARLING

But they were not there.  Yesterday.  

Is that called a delusion...?


She starts to cry.  The phone rings.  The Psychiatrist picks 

it up.


STARLING

B'cause, you know, whatever it is, I 

can't take it anymore...


PSYCHIATRIST

(covering the phone)

I'm sorry.  I'll have to take this 

in the other room.


The Psychiatrist exits, holding the phone.  Starling sits 

for a moment crying.  She goes to the tissuebox on the 

Psychiatrist's desk.  She finds it empty, she sees the edge 

of a new box in the deskdrawer.  She opens the drawer.


ANGLE IN THE DRAWER.


A file on Starling:  marked 'talking points,' and a photocopy 

of her father's badge with the hole through it.


ANGLE ON STARLING


As she looks from the file, and then proceeds to the door to 

the next room, which she opens quietly.


ANGLE HER POV


The Psychiatrist on the phone.  Talking softly.


PSYCHIATRIST

Not too far from a complete breakdown.  

Well, several things would--you've 

done the badge, I suggest...


The Psychiatrist, sensing a presence, turns.  She sees 

Starling, and starts to run out an exit door.


ANGLE, IN THE HALL


Starling pursuing the Psychiatrist.


ANGLE EXT THE PARKING LOT.


Hannibal is mowing the grass, looking at the entrance to the 

Psychiatrist's building, some hundred yards away.


ANGLE INT THE POTATOCHIP VAN.


One of the men is talking on a walkie.


MAN

...Got her staked out.  Yeah, she's 

still in with the...


We hear the buzz of the lawnmower.


MAN

I said:  she's still in with the...


His speech is drowned out by the lawnmower.  He turns to 

roll up his window, and sighs, and glares in the direction 

of the lawnmower man.


ANGLE HIS POV.


Lechter, as he takes off his hat to wipe the sweat from his 

eyes.


ANGLE INT THE VAN.


The potatochip man, staring at Lechter, and then picking up 

the photo of Lechter which is on his dashboard.


MAN

(into walkie)

One moment...


ANGLE, EXT THE PSYCHIATRIST BUILDING DAY.


Starling catches up with the Psychiatrist, she starts to 

shake her.


STARLING

...Who paid you... Who...


ANGLE ON LECHTER


As he is watching the two.  He senses something, and begins 

to turn.


ANGLE ONE OF THE POTATOCHIP ABDUCTORS


Sinks to one knee, and raises an odd looking rifle, and fires.


ANGLE CU LECHTER


As he pulls a small red dart from his neck, and begins to 

slump.


ANGLE ON STARLING


And the Psychiatrist, as Starling spots something over the 

older woman's shoulder.


ANGLE HER POV.


Two men, manhandling the fallen lawnmower man into the 

potatochip van.


ANGLE ON STARLING


As she releases the Psychiatrist, who falls, Starling advances 

toward the van.


ANGLE AT THE BACK OF THE VAN


Lechter starts to come to life.  He kicks out, as he is being 

put into the van, and dislodges a small object on the floor.


ANGLE ON ONE OF THE MEN


As he pulls Lechter off the floor of the van, and administers 

another shot.


ANGLE ON LECHTER'S FEET


As they clear the back of the floor of the van, and the back 

gate comes down on the van.  A package of potatochips falls, 

dislodged by Lechter.


ANGLE ON STARLING


As she runs toward the departing van, which peels out of the 

parkinglot.


She is now standing by her car.  She looks into the car.


ANGLE, INT THE CAR.


Starling's hand, removes the bouquet, she removes her scarf.


Camera takes her to the spot where the van stood.  She looks 

down at the asphalt.


ANGLE HER POV.  THE BAG OF POTATOCHIPS.


ANGLE.  ON STARLING


As she bends down to retrieve the bag of chips.


ANGLE INT CONVENIENCE STORE DAY.


The store fronts on the parking lot, we see Starling, her 

car beyond her, running into the store.


STARLING

FBI where's your phone...?


She goes behind the counter, picks up the phone and dials.


STARLING

(into phone)

Mapp.  Get me Ardelia Mapp.  Well.  

Get in touch with her.  Tell her...


CONVENIENCE STORE OPERATOR

...Could I see some I.D.?


STARLING

Tell her that...


CONVENIENCE STORE OPERATOR

...You're really going to need to 

show me some identification.


We see the Convenience store operator move toward a corner 

of his counter and the butt of a barely concealed pistol.


ANGLE, ON STARLING.


STARLING

..This is Clarice Starling..

(pause)

...This is not a personal message... 

I...

(pause)

I...


She hangs up the phone.


INT. STARLING'S ROOM - DAY.


Insert, onto the bed, we see the box of memorabilia.  We see 

Starling produce the pistol, rummage in the bottom of the 

box, come up with a spare magazine, and seat it in the gun.


ANGLE, INT


The kitchen of Starling and Mapp's apartment, we see the 

door closing behind Starling, and a note taped to the door.


The note reads:  Mapp.  Mason Verger snatched Lechter.  I've 

gone after them.


We hear the sound of the car engine starting up outside.


INT. VERGER'S ROOM - NIGHT.


The child we saw earlier, still asleep on the sofa, his back 

to camera.


VERGER (V.O.)

Yaaasss...


Rack focus to a previously out of focus TV screen in the 

foreground, where we see, Angle ins a TV picture of a medical 

textbook, showing a multicolored plate, the anatomy of the 

feet.


VERGER

Yaas.  Turn the page, please...?


ANGLE IN THE ROOM


We see a mechanical contrivance turn the page.


Verger is in his bed.  On another screen we see the pigs, 

and Cordell walking past them, and into the barn.


ANGLE INT THE BARN.


Cordell walks past a camera, and nods to it.


ANGLE INT THE ROOM.


The same seen on the TV screen.


VERGER

..And how is our prize...?


ANGLE LECHTER


Shackled to a beam of wood, two feet off the ground.  Eyes 

closed.


Cordell comes up to him.  He nods to the two potatochip men, 

who retire.


CORDELL

...Thank you...

(to Lechter)

And how are you this evening, Doctor?  

No, we know that you're awake...


VERGER (V.O.)

Good evening, Dr. Lechter.  Thank 

you for coming.  I am sorry that we 

could not meet under more pleasant 

circumstances.


ANGLE XCU ON LECHTER, AS HE LOOKS UP.


ANGLE HIS POV


A small TV camera set near the ceiling, its red light on.


VERGER (V.O.)

But you will recall what the last 

time we met, you drugged me, and 

induced me, in that state, to scrape 

my face off and feed it to the dogs.  

Did that divert you?  Tell him what 

we are going to do to reciprocate!!!


CORDELL

...The bad news is:  we're going to 

stick your feet through those bars 

tomorrow, and feed them to our pigs.


VERGER (V.O.)

Thank you, Cordell.


LECHTER

(speaking groggily)

...But will that satisfy you?


VERGER

Why should you care?


LECHTER

It is not that I care for you--but 

that I posses an inquiring mind.  

What will you do when I am gone?  

When you have nothing to occupy your 

thoughts, save the memory of your 

own folly, and, more to the point, 

stupidity.


VERGER

Are you done?


LECHTER

(pauses to think, 

then, as if surprised)

Yes.


VERGER

You don't wish to beg...?


LECHTER

Would that add to your mirth?


VERGER

Explain in depth the plan we have 

for him.  Until tomorrow.


ANGLE ON LECHTER, AS HE LOOKS UP AT THE TV CAMERA.


As Cordell speaks, he removes a knife, and begins cutting 

away the legs of Lechter's pants, removing his socks and 

shoes et cetera.


ANGLE HIS POV


The light in the camera flips off.


ANGLE ON LECHTER AND CORDELL.


LECHTER

One would have thought he'd keep me 

under observation.  To savor his 

triumph.


CORDELL

No, I think he proffers to spend his 

happy hours with his playmates.


LECHTER

...Young boys, still...?


CORDELL

...Here's to child abuse!


LECHTER

Mmm...


CORDELL

...And then, he'll be coming down.


LECHTER

You said the bad news...


CORDELL

Yes, I did.


LECHTER

I believe that your tone implied 

that there was some good news... 

And, do you know... There might be 

good news for you...


CORDELL

Oh, yes, what?  You'd bribe me, to, 

to, to, "release" you...?


LECHTER

I can make you rich.


CORDELL

And I expect you to.

(he leans closer to 

Hannibal)

Let's talk like two medical men

(he produces a small 

case, which holds 

two hypodermics)

Lechter's head starts to sway.


CORDELL

Come on, stay with us.  Look here:  

I could get behind you, and give you 

a spinal, tomorrow, you wuunt feel 

anything down there, a l'il pulling 

is all.  N'i'll tell you what, after 

he's got his jollies, ten, f'teen 

minutes, I'll come down here, give 

you a shotta this

(he takes a vial from 

his pocket)

Stop your heart, an that's you done, 

an there's an end to it.  What do 

you say...?

(Cordell removes a 

cellphone from his 

pocket)

I know you got lotsa money, evabody 

says so.  I know how that stuff works, 

take it out, move it around...

(Lecher's head begins 

to drool)

...Stay with me now, fuss with it...  

Whatsay we call your Banker now, 

tell him a code... Move that money 

to me, he confirms it, and I fix you 

up right now...

(he holds up the 

syringe and squirts 

it)

Whatsay?


LECHTER

(mumbling)

..Suitcase... Locker...


CORDELL

Come on, doctor, then you can sleep...


LECHTER

(mumbling)

...Unmarked hundreds....


CORDELL

....What...?

(he leans forward.  

From the back we see 

Lechter's head come 

up and move to bit 

Cordell)


ANGLE EXT THE BARN.


A sound of screaming, the two potatochip men run in guns 

drawn, to see Cordell.  Holding his hand to his bloody face.


MAN ONE

...You wan me to shoot im?


CORDELL

That's the last thing I want...

(to Lechter)

Our other option is to beat you for 

a while, with this axe handle, here.  

I suppose this is what it feels like.


ANGLE


One of the abductors (the potatochip men) goes to a console 

and turns on the sound of recorded screaming.  He looks down 

at the pigs who, hearing the screaming, come to the side of 

the pen.  He looks back toward the direction of Cordell, and 

Lechter, and winces.


He raises the axe handle and prepares to strike.


INT. VERGER'S ROOM.


The shape of Verger on the bed.


Verger is seen in the flicker of the TV screen.


VERGER

Oh yes. Oh, yes, come here... Come 

here... Up lad, when the journey's 

over, they'll be time enough for 

sleep...


We see the form rise from the bed, and rise and walk toward 

Verger.


VERGER

Yes.  Come here.  For what good is 

television, educational as it may 

be, if it is not also entertaining... 

Come--have some popcorn...


We hear the sound of the axe handle hitting something.


VERGER

(to the TV)

Make it last, make it last, for 

godsake, make it last... Don't "hurt" 

him...!


ANGLE EXT. COUNTRY ROAD, NIGHT.


Starling's car, coasting down the hill.  The old gatehouse 

to Verger's property, seen in the moonlight.


ANGLE STARLING


Moving through the moonlit night, through the woods.


We see the mustang, behind her, covered with boughs, in the 

woods, and beyond that, below her, the guardhouse.


Camera takes her up to a barbedwire fence, camouflaged, with 

brush woven into it.  A large tree stands next to the fence, 

with a bough running from the near side to the far side.


ANGLE


Starling looks at it, and smiles.  She walks forward, looking 

intently at the ground.


ANGLE, HER POV.


A small tripwire, suspended six inches off the ground, covers 

the area in front of the so-attractive tree.  Starling follows 

the tripwire down, parallel to the fence.  She steps over 

the tripwire and proceeds down, watching the fence, looking 

intently.


She goes into a gully where we see that a runoff of a stream 

is eroding a hole underneath the barbedwire fence.


ANGLE, ON STARLING


As she gets down on the ground, takes a stick and probes in 

the flow of water underneath the fence.  She nods, satisfied, 

and begins to use the stick to enlarge the opening under the 

fence.


INT. VERGER'S ROOM. - NIGHT.


CORDELL

Mr. Verger...?


VERGER

I'm awake.  Oh.  Is it time!


Cordell starts to push the gurneybed out of the room.


VERGER

Oh, yes, one waits so long, and then, 

and then... Almost by magic... Yes, 

proceed.  Please... Proceed...


Cordell starts to exit.


Camera sees the gurney bed, with Verger on it, a small couch, 

on which is a young boy, asleep, in front of a silent 

television, a bowl of popcorn by him.


EXT. THE PIGBARN. - DAWN.


ANGLE ON STARLING


Advancing from the woods, pistol in hand.  She hears 

screaming.  She hesitates, then moves closer.


ANGLE, HER POV.


One of the abductors, teasing the pigs, pushes a pair of 

stuffed dungarees through the enclosure.


ANGLE ON STARLING, WHO TURNS HER HEAD.


HER POV:


At the main house, by the potatochip van, the gurney emerges, 

wheeled by Cordell.  It moves toward a forklift truck.


ANGLE AT THE GURNEY.


CORDELL

..It won't be long now, sir...


VERGER

Ohforgodsake, get on with it.


Cordell moves to the forklift, starts it, and it moves toward 

the gurney.


ANGLE ON STARLING


As she watches the forklift gently pick up Verger in the 

gurneybed.  The sound of screaming stops.


She sees the abductor turn off the music, and retreat into 

the barn.


ANGLE STARLING


Moving alongside the pig's enclosure.


She moves to a wall of the barn.


ANGLE HER POV IN THE BARN.


Lechter, manacled and bound to beam.


She sees an abductor moving toward him.  Lowering his beam 

to the ground, and then moving off, into the tackroom, off.


ANGLE IN THE BARN.


Starling bursts into the tackroom.


STARLING

(to the abductor)

On the ground, on the ground...


She moves to him, as he complies, and removes handcuffs, and 

cuffs the man around a pole.  He starts to remonstrate, and 

she hits him on the head with her gunbutt.  She exits the 

tackroom, and enters the barn and advances on the mauled and 

beaten form of Lechter.


LECHTER

Good morning, Clarice.


STARLING

Can you walk?  Are your legs 

working...?


LECHTER

Perhaps... Shall we see...?


STARLING

I'm going to cut you loose.  With 

all due respect, Doctor, if you fuck 

with me, I'll shoot you dead, do you 

understand...?  Do right and you'll 

live through this.


LECHTER

Spoken like a protestant.


Starling takes out a knife, and begins to cut the doctor 

loose.


LECHTER

I'll do the rest, if you give me the 

knife.


She looks over his shoulder, at the forklift coming down the 

hill.


STARLING

No, I don't think so.


Lechter has freed himself, and is chafing his limbs to restore 

circulation.


STARLING

(as she points to the 

forklift)

I'm going to subdue our friends, 

coming down the hill, and I want you 

to cuff em, and to put em inside 

with the other Fella... My car is

(she gestures back at 

the woods)


LECHTER

Other Fellow?  There should have 

been two of them...?


ANGLE ON THE SECOND ABDUCTOR


In the loft of the barn, holding his dartgun.  He fires.


ANGLE CU ON STARLING


Who extracts a dart from her bicep.  She looks around, and 

falls, dazily.  Her pistol falls through the bars into the 

pigpen.


ANGLE ON THE MAN IN THE LOFT


As he reloads, and sights on Lechter, who is kneeling by 

Starling.  We see Lechter pick up her pistol, and fire at 

the man in the loft.


ANGLE.


The man in the loft, he falls against a railing, he drops 

his dartrifle.


It drops into the pig's pen.


He drops, dead, into the pig's pen.


ANGLE


On the pigs, as they go wild, trying to eat the rifle.


ANGLE


On the forklift and the gurney, as it enters the barn.


ANGLE ON CORDELL DRIVING THE FORKLIFT.


VERGER

What's happening, would you please...?


ANGLE ON LECHTER


As he moves to Starling, and pulls her away from the pigpen, 

he tries to reach through the bars for her pistol, but it is 

just out of reach.


He looks up.


ANGLE ON VERGER AND CORDELL, APPROACHING LECHTER.


CORDELL

Stop there, would you, please, 

doctor...?


LECHTER

The girl could use some help.


VERGER

You're free...


LECHTER

...Which of us is free...?


VERGER

Yes, to cease to hope is the greatest 

crime.  The greatest crime.  Perhaps 

the only crime.  I never ceased to 

hope!


LECHTER

The girl needs help.


VERGER

And what would be of greater help, 

than to release her, from the bonds 

of this sordid earthly existence.  

Don't you think?  In which the 

innocent are tortured in ways which 

would make the anguish of the damned 

seem tame and unimaginative, don't 

you think?  Blind him again, and 

prepare him and her for the pigs!

(Cordell, holding a 

gun, advances on 

Lechter)


LECHTER

...Might I make a suggestion...?


VERGER

...After you're dead.  And when I 

give the word, do you understand... 

When I give the word...


ANGLE ON LECHTER


Being bound, and hoisted up, again, on the beam.


CORDELL

...Fraid, that's about it, Doctor.


LECHTER

Let the girl go.


CORDELL

Why?


LECHTER

For a consideration.


CORDELL

'fraid it's too late.


VERGER

...When I...

(pause)

Cordell continues the final 

preparations of Lechter.


LECHTER

...What has she done to harm you...?


CORDELL

Yes, do you know, you're right...

(he pauses)

...Mr. Verger...?

(pause)

Mr. Verger, sir?  He's ready...

(pause)


ANGLE ON CORDELL


As he leaves the trussed Lechter, stepping over Starling, 

and proceeds back toward the gurney, which is half hidden by 

the pigpen.


ANGLE HIS POV.


As he comes around the corner, the child Franklin has the 

bowl of popcorn, and is seen feeding popcorn to Verger.


ANGLE CORDELL'S POV.


The lifesigns display of Verger.  A single blip, a long pause, 

another irregular blip.  A long pause.


ANGLE CORDELL, AS HE ADVANCES ON THE CHILD.


CORDELL

Hey, Franklin.  Hey.  Tell you what, 

if you'd just stop doing that, I'm 

going to give you something nice.


FRANKLIN

He don't like popcorn.


CORDELL

No.  And...


FRANKLIN

I like popcorn...


CORDELL

...Yes, if you'll, just step away...


FRANKLIN

You give me whatever I want...?


CORDELL

Yes.  You know I will.  That's right.


FRANKLIN

Awright.


Franklin steps away.  And Cordell runs up to Verger and tries 

to revive him.


ANGLE


On Franklin, as he moves around the pen, and pulls a lever 

which opens the gate.


ANGLE


On the pigs, as they start to move into the area occupied by 

Cordell and Verger.


ANGLE


On Franklin.


FRANKLIN

You know what I want...?


ANGLE


On Cordell, bent over Verger, as he looks back.


ANGLE 


On Franklin


FRANKLIN

I want kittykat!!!


ANGLE


On Cordell, as he sees the pigs approaching, he starts to 

scream.


ANGLE


On Franklin, as he climbs up to the area where we see Lechter.


LECHTER

Let me down, son, let me down.


FRANKLIN

What'll you do for me?


LECHTER

I'll take you home.


FRANKLIN

Ain't got no home.


LECHTER

Then what would you like...?


Franklin comes over and whispers to him.


ANGLE


On Hannibal, as he recoils.  Beat.  The sound of screaming 

stops.


PAUSE


HANNIBAL

(pause)

Yes.  You shall have it...


FRANKLIN

Then you goin to hell...


HANNIBAL

...That's right...


Franklin looses the rope which holds Lechter, and Lechter 

enters the pigpen.  We see the pigs, at the far end, savaging 

what we assume to be the forms of Verger and Cordell.


ANGLE


On Hannibal, as he stoops to the form of Starling, and gathers 

her up.  The pigs advance on him, and then stop...


He steps through them, and out of the barn.


ANGLE EXT THE BARN.


Starling, put down in the grass.  Beat.  She stirs.  She 

half-opens her eyes.


ANGLE, HER POV


Lechter, walking toward her, behind him the Verger estate 

bursting into roaring flames.


ANGLE


On Franklin, standing by the flames, looking at Lechter, as 

he walks up toward Starling.


ANGLE


On Lechter, as he picks up Starling, we see a security car 

coming down the drive, as Lechter and Starling fade into the 

woods.


DISSOLVE TO:


INT. SUMPTUOUS, ELEGANT DININGROOM.


Starling, in a decollete evening gown, standing in front of 

a perfect presentation of baccarat and limoges.


ANGLE HER POV.


Lechter, in a tuxedo, standing against the balcony of the 

room, which looks out on the sea.  He smiles at her.


LECHTER

You look lovely.


STARLING

Thank you.

(she moves to sit, 

and Lechter comes up 

and holds her chair 

for her)

No, I know you'd prefer "I'm glad 

you find me so..."


LECHTER

I'd prefer you to say what you feel.


STARLING

What is that that smells so wonderful.


LECHTER

I hope you'll find it so.

(he pours her a glass 

of wine)

Yes.  It's good to see you regaining 

your strength...


STARLING

Thanks to you...


We see Lechter excuse himself, and retire into the kitchen.


We see him taking down saucepans, and mixing what appears to 

be a marinade.


LECHTER

Now, what were we last speaking of...?


STARLING

We were speaking of my father...


Lechter pours the marinade into a pan, lights the flame in 

the stove, wipes his hands, and returns to the diningroom.


LECHTER

...I'm sorry...?


STARLING

...We were speaking of my father...


LECHTER

Indeed we were.


STARLING

...And my need for the institution...


LECHTER

Freud, do you know...?  Freud 

psychoanalyzed patients in one 

afternoon.


STARLING

And how did he do that?


LECHTER

He saw the truth, and spoke it...


STARLING

I'm afraid, this wine is making me 

woozy...


LECHTER

...You have to eat...


Lechter returns to the kitchen, indicating "one moment."


LECHTER

(as the camera takes 

him to the kitchen, 

and we half-see the 

torso of a man sitting 

in a kitchen chair)

You've sought out the institution 

all your life, as you with it to 

replace your father.  This is obvious.  

Less obvious is this:  that you 

require the institution not to support 

you, but to fail.  For this keeps 

your father alive.


ANGLE

On Starling, sitting, nodding, as 

she drinks her wine.  She puts the 

glass down, a trifle woozy.


LECHTER

...As this keeps your father alive.  

The truth is two-fold, and the truth 

is one:


The wind from the ocean blows a strand of hair across her 

eyes, she brushes it back.


LECHTER (V.O.)

That every man is fallible, that 

every institution, being made of 

men, cannot but be corrupt...


ANGLE ON STARLING


Looking down at her hand.


ANGLE HER POV.


The hand is covered with mud and blood.


ANGLE, STARLING


Looking perplexed, at the kitchen where we see the form of 

Lechter, moving across the kitchen.


ANGLE ON LECHTER.


As we see, he carries a scalpel, he moves toward the half-

seen form of the man in the chair.


He bends down over the man, and we see that he carries a 

scalpel and a small medical saw...


LECHTER

...The only art in this dish, of 

course, is that it must be fresh...


ANGLE


On Starling, in the room, as she picks up a small rosebud 

from the cut crystal budvase in front of her.


She looks at it woozily, and it falls from her fingers.


She bends down.


ANGLE, HER POV, THE FLOOR.


The rosebud, on a filthy, torn linoleum floor, her legs 

encased in the muddy pants we saw her in at Verger's farm.


ANGLE


On Starling, as she straightens, holding the rose.  We see a 

look of consternation on her face.  Her face is bloody, and 

covered in mud, we see she is not in a sumptuous dining room, 

but in a slum.


ANGLE HER POV


Lechter, in the kitchen, in tuxedo, moving past the doorway.


ANGLE INT THE KITCHEN.


Lechter, as we now see, in the filthy kitchen of a slum.  

Cooking on a hotplate.  Dressed in workclothes, camera takes 

him, from behind, to the slumped form of the man, camera 

cuts off at the man's shoulders, we see Lechter, from the 

back, lifting something from the direction of the man's head, 

and carrying it back to the filthy tabletop, where, as he 

speaks, he begins kneading it with flour, we see the pan 

sizzling on the hotplate.


ANGLE


In the slum room.  Starling, dazed, and Lechter, reentering.


LECHTER

That the institution cannot but be 

corrupt, and, therefore, it cannot 

be but an act of complicity to seek 

to appease it.


He moves back into the kitchen, puts the breaded pieces of 

cutlet into the pan, the fire shoots up.


LECHTER

So many civilizations eat their slain 

enemies... What do you think...?  

How much better to devour a person 

physically, than to devour his spirit.  

Which is, of course, the purpose of 

the institution.


He removes the meat from the pan, and forks it onto a tin 

plate.


LECHTER

(reentering the dining 

room)

:and that is the especial surprise, 

I've prepared for you!


STARLING

I feel weak...


LECHTER

(nodding)

...You must eat.


She looks down at the table.  She picks up her fork.


ANGLE HER POV


The lovely linen table, the steaming meat on the limoges 

plate.


A huge cockroach, scurrying across the tablecloth.


ANGLE

On Starling, as she rises, unsteadily, 

in her muddy clothes...


STARLING

...I Don't understand...


She walks toward the balcony window, looking out at the ocean.


ANGLE HER POV.


Out the window, a squalid city street, seen from the third 

floor.


A couple of cars stopping at the end of the street.


ANGLE, ON STARLING


As she turns back toward Lechter.


LECHTER

(in the kitchen)

The gift, of course is not the meal-- 

but the identification--which of us 

does not need help?  The identity, 

of your true enemy...? ...For you 

always sought to befriend, to wish 

the love of those who wished you 

ill.


ANGLE, ON LECHTER


Standing before the figure tied to the chair.


LECHTER

Come here--he is in no pain, there 

are no nerves in the brain, come 

here...


ANGLE, LECHTER'S POV 


The figure of Crawford tied to the chair.


Lechter moves to him and extracts from his upper pocket, a 

xerox of the photo of the badge with the hole in it.


LECHTER

Come here, I'm going to cure you.


ANGLE HIS POV.


Starling, in the slumroom, looking out of the window.


ANGLE


Starling, dazed, looking out of the window, Lechter comes up 

behind her, and looks out.


ANGLE HIS POV.


The slum street, a van now pulling up, a squad of SWAT 

Officers approaching a parked car.


ANGLE


On Lechter and Clarice.


Lechter approaches her.


ANGLE HIS POV


Starling, in the beautiful gown, he moves as if to caress 

her breast.


ANGLE ON STARLING


As she looks down.  We see she is now clothed in her filthy 

clothes, and Lechter is frisking her.


Lechter, frisking the filthy Starling, takes out the 

marinecorp hatbadge, which we saw earlier, he breaks it open, 

and reveals a microtransmitter.


LECHTER

Oh, no.  Oh, no.  They've put a beeper 

on you.  How careless of me.  How 

finally careless, do you think?  

Have I erred on purpose?  Eh?  Or am 

I just unlucky?  Could one not say 

that's the essential question of 

philosophy...?


ANGLE ON STARLING


Dazed, looking on.


STARLING

Might I have some more of the wine...?


ANGLE ON LECHTER


As he moves to a back window.


Starling, as she rises, again, in her ballgown.


STARLING

Because, I find I like the effects.  

You may say that it's inebriation, 

but it seems

(she smiles)

This lovely evening, in particular... 

It seems to reward me with clarity...

(she laughs)

There is a sound behind her.  The 

beautiful frenchdoors open and admit 

a happy coterie of gowned women and 

formal dressed men, they are all 

chattering their joy at seeing her.


STARLING

...Or perhaps, it is just the heat... 

I was just saying to the doctor...

(she gestures)


ANGLE HER POV 


The open window, the shades blowing.


Camera comes back to Starling, who is in her rags, with the 

SWAT team entering the room.


STARLING

But, do you know, do you know, I'm 

not feeling altogether...


She swoons.  A SWAT man catches her.


SWAT MAN

...I've got her...


ANGLE


In the slumroom, we see that a SWAT team has entered.  One 

of them has caught the fainting Starling in his arms.  The 

several men proceed toward the back of the kitchen.


STARLING

(as we see she is in 

Krendler's arms)

...May be the heat....


KRENDLER

Let's get her out of here....


SWAT Officer, from the kitchen.  As he gazes in the direction 

of Crawford.


STARLING

But as my father used to say...


SWAT OFFICER

(in kitchen)

...Ohmigod.


DISSOLVE TO:


EXT. TEXAS GRAVEYARD - DAY.


A new marble headstone being lowered onto a grave.  It is 

ornate and solid, and reads:  James Randall Starling, husband 

and father.  Died 1975.


ANGLE


Starling standing by the grave, holding flowers, behind her 

stand Mapp and her boyfriend.  Behind them stand an official 

looking man, who holds his stetson, reverently, in front of 

him.  In the bg we see a truck moving slowly down the dusty 

cemetery road.


ANGLE ON STARLING


As she kneels, as the stone is placed, putting a small bouquet 

of flowers next to it.  As she kneels, and camera cranes 

down, we read the bottom of the inscription:  "died 1975.  

He will never know how he was missed."


She stands, and Mapp comes, and puts her arm around her.


MAPP

That's why it's a stone, you know, 

it means don't come back.


Starling nods, and they turn away, and walk away from the 

grave.  In the bg we see another group of mourners, wearing 

western garb.  Starling and her group cross a service road, 

in front of the old truck.


STARLING

Well.  No.  He can't come back.


MAPP

Baby, that's the beginning of wisdom.


Mapp puts her arm around Starling, as they walk off.


Starling nods, that she understands, and lays her head on 

Mapp's shoulder.


We see several gravediggers sitting on the back.  The man in 

the passenger seat, wearing a straw western hat, turns, to 

look at Starling and the group.  It looks like Lechter.


ANGLE ON STARLING AND HER GROUP


As the man in the truck momentarily catches her eye.


ANGLE


On Starling, as she walks through the graveyard.


A glint of light plays across her face, and she squints.


ANGLE HER POV.


The light hitting the shovel of the gravedigger in the straw 

hat.  The gravedigger is half hidden by the group he walks 

with.


ANGLE


Over Mapp, who is talking, and onto Starling, as she stares 

at the gravedigger, who is approaching her.


ANGLE


On her body, as she reaches to her belt for a sidearm.


ANGLE


Tight on the two women, as Starling leans in.


STARLING

(sotto)

Give me your gun...


ANGLE


On Mapp, as she looks at Starling.


MAPP

...What...?


ANGLE


On Starling, as she looks at the approaching figure.


ANGLE HER POV


The gravedigger, as he emerges from the group.  We see he is 

a nondescript laborer.


ANGLE


On Starling and Mapp.


MAPP

...What, what did you say...?


ANGLE


On Starling, as she shakes her head.


ANGLE


On the laborer, as he passes by an arriving, older limousine, 

Starling and Mapp in the background.


ANGLE


On Starling and Mapp, as Mapp and Jim take their leave from 

Starling, who is indicating, "i just want to be alone for a 

while."


We see Mapp nod, as she and Jim get into their car.


ANGLE ON STARLING


As she walks back toward her father's grave past a small 

black clad family, who are emerging from the limo.


ANGLE XCU ON STARLING


As she looks at the offending figure.


ANGLE HER POV.


The man turns more to camera, and we see he is a nondescript 

laborer.


ANGLE


On Starling, as she takes her leave of Mapp and Mapp's friend, 

we see them pass by another small funeral, several black 

clad mourners and an old limousine, at the graveside.


Starling chats with Mapp for a moment, obviously saying she, 

Starling, wants to stay on at the grave.  Mapp nods, and she 

and her friend get into their car and drive away.


ANGLE


On Starling, as she passes by the other funeral, back toward 

her father's grave.


ANGLE INT THE LIMO.


We see, through its windshield, Starling cross, and move out 

of frame.


We see the black coated arm of the limo driver move.  His 

hand comes up to the rearview mirror, and we see Starling in 

the rearview mirror, and we see the driver's hand has the 

small scar in the shape of the numeral three.


FADE OUT.
