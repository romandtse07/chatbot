"THE WOODS"

(aka "The Village")


by


M. NIGHT SHYAMALAN




EXT. HILLTOP - NOON


One might describe the scene as beautiful, if one could get 

by the child's coffin.


A wooden sign in the dirt reads.


"Here lies Daniel Nicholson.

Beloved by all.

Died October 3, 1897"


A wilting man in his late forties sits on the grass next to 

the much too small box.


MAN

(smiling)

Who will plague me with questions 

now?... Who will pinch me to wake me 

up? Who will laugh at me when I fall?

(voice cracks)

Who's breath will I listen to so 

that I may sleep? Who's hand will I 

hold, so that I may walk?


The wilting man's face trembles.


Behind him, a respectful thirty feet away, stand a group of 

about sixty people, equally still.


CUT TO:


EXT. SUPPER TABLE  AFTERNOON


An enormous handmade wooden table sits in the center of a 

small village of log cabins. All sixty members of the village 

are seated for the meal.


The women wear bonnets. The men have their farmer's shirts 

rolled up at the sleeves.


A man in his late forties stands. He has the eyes of a child; 

innocent and pure. This is EDWARD WALKER.


WALKER

We came here to start anew --


Beat. Eyes look up one by one. Edward Walker stands silently, 

appearing suddenly overwhelmed. A hand reaches up and squeezes 

his arm. Edward Walker looks down to wilting man we saw 

earlier. They look at each other quietly.


Walker turns back to the table.


WALKER

We came here to start anew. We are 

grateful for the time we have been 

given.


Walker sits. Movement begins across the table as hands begin 

to pass bread and corn and meat.


AND THEN WE HEAR IT, THE SOUND CARRIES THROUGH THE AIR AND 

BLEEDS INTO THE VILLAGE. IT COMES FROM THE WOODS.


SCREAMS. IT IS NOT HUMAN.


All movement at the table stops, except for a TALL BOY at 

the end of the table. He is barely in his twenties. He is 

mentally handicapped. He starts clapping wildly.


Everyone else sits uncomfortably still. No expressions on 

their faces. They wait.


THEN THE SCREAMS SLOWLY START TO MOVE AWAY.


The boy's clapping slows and then stops as well. The happiness 

trickles from his face.


The rest of the table waits till the last of the nonhuman 

screams have moved away. And then quietly hands start reaching 

across the table again.


CUT TO:


EXT. WATER PUMP  LATE AFTERNOON


A group of women and girls are washing and drying the wooden 

bowls and plates at a hand water pump that stands in the 

ground.


A strong older woman pumps the handle. Bursts of water spurt 

out from the pump's mouth. Two girls are holding bowls under 

the water. One girl gets splashed by the other. They both 

start laughing. The older woman makes a disapproving noise 

with her mouth. The girls looks over, nod and return to 

washing the bowls; little grins on their little faces.


CUT TO:


EXT. PORCH  LATE AFTERNOON


Two young women sweep the porch of a cabin. One of the young 

women starts mimicking the other's movements. They begin to 

sweep in synch. They both begin to smile as they sweep. They 

begin to move around the porch like dancers.


They're giggling stops as one spots something. They both 

stop dancing. They look down at the base of the post that 

holds the porch roof up. There are two RED WILDFLOWERS peeking 

out from the fist full of weeds.


They bend down quickly and yank the red wildflowers out. 

They move off the porch and kneel down in the dirt next to 

the porch.


They use their hands to a dig a small hole in the dirt. They 

put the crushed red wildflowers into the hole and methodically 

bury it.


The two young women stand, look around, and wipe themselves 

off before returning to the porch and picking up the brooms 

again.


CUT TO:


EXT. COURTYARD BELL  LATE AFTERNOON


A MEDIUM SIZED BRASS BELL hangs from a wooden t-post. A hand 

reaches out and takes hold of the rope that dangles from its 

side. The hand pulls once strong and hard.


CUT TO:


EXT. STORAGE CABIN  LATE AFTERNOON


Men stow away farm equipment. Hoes and sickles are stacked 

neatly in piles.


A LONG BELL TOLLS.


The men stop working. They put down their tool where they 

stand. One man leans into the storage cabin to tell those 

inside.


MAN

Drill bell.


CUT TO:


EXT. WATER PUMP  LATE AFTERNOON


The older women usher the girls into an orderly line as they 

leave the area of the water pump. Dirty dishes are left on 

the ground.


CUT TO:


EXT. CLUSTER OF CABINS  LATE AFTERNOON


We see the courtyard. There are clusters of cabins on every 

side. We watch as one by one everyone in the courtyard and 

everyone coming in from the fields, disappears into different 

cabins like ants retreating into ant holes.


CUT TO:


INT. CABIN  LATE AFTERNOON


We are in someone's home. A group of about eight women and 

children walk in through the front door. They move to the 

back of the small cabin where a woman reaches down and pulls 

on a handle in the floor.


CUT TO:


INT. DIFFERENT CABIN  LATE AFTERNOON


We are in another two-room cabin. A group of men wait their 

turn as each man climbs into the trap door in the floor.


When the last is in. The final man reaches up and brings 

down the trap door, closing them all in.


CUT TO:


INT. UNDERGROUND ROOM  LATE AFTERNOON


A collection of two men, four women and three children are 

huddled together in a four by eight space in the ground. The 

adults have to sit down to fit in this space.


A THIN STRIP OF LIGHT FALLS ON THE FACES from the seam in 

the trapdoor. All we hear is the nine of them breathing. 

Their eyes all stare at the CRACK OF LIGHT.


A child coughs. A woman reaches over a couple bodies and 

pats the coughing child on his back. The child settles. They 

all return to staring at the light. Beat.


THE BRASS BELL SOUNDS AGAIN.


The two men reach up and open the door. LIGHT POURS IN.


One by one, they all climb out of the four by eight space in 

the ground.


CUT TO:


INT. FAMILY CABIN  LATE AFTERNOON


The men, women and three children walk out into the afternoon 

light. One woman immediately grabs a broom and continues 

cleaning the porch.


The community returns to doing their chores.


CUT TO:


EXT. CABIN  NIGHT


We are in the darkness, looking into the LIGHT OF A CABIN 

WINDOW. We see a child's bedroom -- A small bed -- A small 

wooden desk. On the child's desk there is nothing.


The wilting man lays curled up on the little bed. He stares 

out with red eyes.


CUT TO:


EXT. CABIN  NIGHT


In another cabin we see a woman pouring water from a jug 

into a large white bowl by the side of the bed. We see her 

speak to her husband who sits reading in bed. She leans over 

and begins washing her face with the water in the bowl.


CUT TO:


EXT. CABIN  NIGHT


Three children kneel and pray by their bedside. Their parents 

begin blowing out the oil lamps in their room.


CUT TO:


EXT. TOWER  NIGHT


A young man blows his nose into a handkerchief. He wipes his 

face and resumes standing. His eyes gaze down quietly. The 

ORANGE LIGHT FROM THE TORCH LIT NEXT TO HIM, FLICKERS ON HIS 

FACE.


He is standing on a platform, thirty feet in the air. It is 

a tower on the edge of this community. He is keeping guard.


Arms folded, he stares at the darkened woods.


CUT TO:


EXT. SCHOOL HOUSE  MORNING


A group of children carrying cloth bags with books in them, 

crowd around something in the dirt.


Edward Walker moves through the tiny gathering.


WALKER

What manner of spectacle has caught 

your attention so splendidly? I ought 

to carry it in my pocket to help me 

teach.


Edward Walker parts the final layer of titillated children. 

He stares down at the thing on the ground. Beat. His 

expression becomes grave.


WALKER

Who came upon this?


It takes a moment before a little boy steps forward. His 

eyes never look up.


WALKER

Philip, did you move this?


PHILIP shakes his head, "No." Everyone watches Walker who 

turns and looks down again quietly.


IT IS HARD FOR US TO SEE THROUGH ALL THE TINY LEGS AND FEET 

OF THE CHILDREN. THERE IS SOMETHING DARK AND MOIST LYING IN 

THE DIRT.


CUT TO:


INT. CLASSROOM  MORNING


The classroom is overcome by whispering. Walker uses chalk 

to write the date, "October 5, 1897" on a gray slate board 

framed in wood.


He turns to the children who age from seven to twelve.


WALKER

Okay, lets have it. What delicious 

conclusions have you come to?


THIN BOY

An animal God created was slain.


WALKER

Donald, please try to speak plainly. 

It disturbs your mother when you 

speak so darkly. Everything need not 

be said with such drama.


Another hand shoots up.


WALKER

Marybeth.


MARYBETH

I inspected it carefully. Its head 

was twisted back and much of its fur 

removed.


WALKER

I see.


DONALD

It was murdered.


Now the children become quiet.


WALKER

So who is the culprit? Who has done 

this heinous act?


Beat.


MARY

Those We Don't Speak Of, killed it.


WALKER

And there it is.

(beat)

Why would such a notion enter your 

heads?


TWELVE-YEAR OLD BOY

Those We Don't Speak Of have claws.


WALKER

Children... Those We Don't Speak Of 

have not breached our border for 

many years. We do not go into their 

woods and they do not come into our 

valley. We do not threaten them. Why 

would they do this?


DONALD

It is a warning of doom to come.


WALKER

(stern)

Donald.


Walker gazes out at the classroom of concerned children.


WALKER

Is it possible, in your haste, you 

have missed the simplest explanation? 

That this small animal was slain by 

a slightly larger animal like a fox, 

and that this said fox carried it 

into our village to avoid other 

scavengers from coming and eating 

his prize. And when our village awoke 

and started its morning business, 

the fox was scared off and left its 

prize for us to find.

(beat)

I can't say if that's what really 

happened, but it's certainly more 

reasonable to think that, than 

something... unprecedented.


MARY

I did see two foxes on the hill 

yesterday.


Walker watches the image of foxes scamper through the minds 

of the children.


WALKER

Does anyone have further questions 

pertaining to our immediate doom?


Walker winks at Donald. No one raises their hand.


WALKER

Then if it is agreeable, let us begin 

our studies.


One by one, the children reach into their cloth bags and 

retrieve their notebooks.


CUT TO:


INT. MEETING HALL  AFTERNOON


We are in one of the largest cabins. Wooden chairs are 

scattered throughout. This is some sort of gathering place.


Twelve of the chairs have been brought together in a circle. 

Twelve of the oldest members of the village are seated in 

the chairs.


The wilting man and Edward Walker are among them.


FIDGETY WOMAN

We ought not to overlook the Flight 

of the Birds. We didn't have it last 

year and I for one missed it 

desperately. I know Tabitha missed 

the children dressed in feathers and 

such.


A small gentle women with her air tied back, looks up. TABITHA 

sits to Edward Walker's side.


TABITHA

I am fond of it.


The two women slowly turn to Edward.


EDWARD

I do not have a say in this matter. 

August Nicholson is Chair of today's 

meeting.


All eyes turn to the wilting man, AUGUST NICHOLSON. He appears 

exhausted. August nods as he shuffles the papers in his hand.


AUGUST

The Flight of the Birds will be 

returned to this year's Fall Festival.


The group nods quietly.


FIDGETY WOMAN

Let us speak of food then.


THERE IS A KNOCK at the far end of the room. All attention 

moves in that direction.


Another man in his mid forties steps in. He carries a tiny 

smile, his eyebrows are raised.


MAN

There is a young man who has requested 

a word with the elders.


The group looks to one another. This is unusual.


AUGUST

Do have him come forward.


The man with the raised eyebrows steps out. Beat. The door 

stays still for a moment, and then it opens.


A sinewy young man in his twenties steps in. His deep-set 

brow and dark green eyes never look up as he walks forward 

to the group.


There are many glances to a pretty elder in her forties. 

Edward looks to her as well. She stares back with the 

identical dark green eyes as the boy. She shakes her head 

slightly; She doesn't know why he's here.


The young man slows to a stop a few feet from them. His hands 

brings a paper up. He begins to read carefully.


GREEN EYES

My mother is unaware of the reason 

for my visit today. She did not give 

her consent or consult me in any 

form.


The woman with green eyes moves forward in her seat without 

knowing it.


GREEN EYES

I have spent all but my first years 

in this village. It is all that I 

know. It is a blessed place, this 

village. Our days are filled with 

love and compassion and joy.


His green eyes flick up, just for a moment... He returns to 

the paper.


GREEN EYES

But there is also some suffering and 

fear. The passing of little Daniel 

Nicholson from illness --


August Nicholson goes still.


GREEN EYES

-- and other events have weighted on 

my thoughts. We have been taught of 

the greed and corruption that exists 

in the towns. And the countless wasted 

lives centered on the exchange of 

money there. But we have also been 

taught about their fascination with 

science and machines and medicine. 

Could they have rescued Daniel from 

his terrible illness?

(beat)

I ask permission to cross into the 

forbidden woods and travel to the 

nearest town. I will gather new 

medicines and information of what 

has happened in the world, and I 

will return.


Beat.


GREEN EYES

With regards to Those we don't speak 

of, I am but a single person, I am 

not a threat to them, I am certain 

they will let me pass.

(beat)

Creatures can sense emotion and fear. 

They will see I am pure of intention 

and not afraid. The end.


The young man with green eyes lowers his hands with the paper 

and stares at the group.


No one move at first. Edward Walker begins to smile.


WALKER

(soft)

Lucius Hunt, that is the most I've 

heard you speak in many years 

combined.


The young man with green eyes stands quietly before the group.


CUT TO:


INT. CABIN  NIGHT


The pretty woman with green eyes sits on the edge of her bed 

in her night robe. She hear her son descend the ladder from 

the loft space he lives in.


ALICE HUNT watches him through her bedroom doorway.


ALICE

What goes on in that head of yours?


LUCIUS turns to face her.


ALICE

Say something Lucius.


Beat. Lucius stares.


LUCIUS

(soft)

Finton Coin is in the Tower. I 

promised to sit with him.


Alice lies back in her bed. She pulls the covers over herself. 

She gazes at her son from the pillow.


ALICE

Why do you not tell me what you feel? 

I do not know if you think about 

love. I do not know what your dreams 

are. When you stood today, you spoke 

in such a gentlemanly manner. I 

scarcely recognized you.


Her eyes close.


ALICE

How can a mother fail to recognize 

her son? Tell me. Tell me that...


Lucius watches his mother become quiet. Her breathing becomes 

steady and soft.


Lucius walks into her room and takes the quilt from the 

rocking chair and gently places it over his mother's sleeping 

shoulders. He whispers in her ear.


LUCIUS

I do think about love.


Lucius walks out of his mother's room and exits the cabin 

quietly.


CUT TO:


EXT. TOWER  NIGHT


FINTON COIN is a skinny boy with big curly hair. He is on 

the platform tonight, thirty feet in the air.


The trap door opens as Lucius climbs up. Finton immediately 

relaxes.


FINTON

Did anyone see your approach?


Lucius shakes his head. "No."


FINTON

I saw Christop Crane sniffing around. 

He suspects something. He has 

announced, more than once, in my 

presence that only one man should 

hold post in the tower each night. 

Why would he say such a thing if he 

didn't suspect? What a wretch he is? 

Is it so bad to be a trifle timid? 

Are you sure you were not detected?


Lucius shakes his head again, "No" as he takes his seat in 

the corner. Beat.


FINTON

And I shared a portion of my chicken 

with him not two days ago. A fine, 

tender piece.


The two young men fall into silence; one sitting, one 

standing. And then out of the silence --


LUCIUS

Do you ever think of towns Finton?


Finton turns to the sound of Lucius' voice.


FINTON

The towns? What for? They're wicked 

places where wicked people live, 

that's all.


Finton doesn't notice the expression on Lucius' face as he 

sits in the shadows. Finton shrugs his shoulders and returns 

to looking out. Beat.


FINTON

(soft)

I do hope no one saw you.


CUT TO:


EXT. APPLE ORCHARD  DAY


Along the hilltop runs a group of twenty apple trees; their 

branches bursting with deep red pickings.


On the ground near the trees are baskets filled with apples. 

A few are toppled over.


Standing in a tight group a few feet from the abandoned 

baskets are a group of women. The same quiet fearful 

expressions on their faces.


They stare at something at the base of a tree. We can't see 

what it is, but we can HEAR THE FLIES BUZZING around its 

dead carcass.


ALICE (O.S.)

We understand the depth of your 

worries, but you needn't be alarmed.


CUT TO:


INT. MEETING HALL  AFTERNOON


Every member of the village is jammed into this little 

building. The elders are standing towards the front of the 

room.


Alice Hunt's green eyes look compassionately over the 

gathering.


ALICE

What we seem to have amongst us, is 

a scavenger of some type. Most likely 

a coyote or wolf. It's manner of 

killing and removing the fur, but 

leaving the flesh torn may be a sign 

that the animal may suffer from 

madness.


An uncomfortable murmur flutters in the meeting room.


ALICE

For the next fortnight we should be 

vigilant for sightings of this coyote. 

Keep careful watch over the little 

ones as they play on the hills.

(lowers voice)

As for the other notion... we do not 

believe our boundary has been 

breached. Those We Don't Speak Of 

are much larger creatures than 

coyotes. We would know if they had 

been here.


CUT TO:


EXT. COURTYARD  AFTERNOON


We pick up Edward Walker as he leaves the meeting hall with 

the rest of the congregation. A young woman in her early 

twenties catches up to him. She has a round attractive face. 

She is the lively sort. She practically bounces to his side.


GIRL

It's frightful, this business with 

the coyote, is it not Papa?


WALKER

Do not feel worried Kitty?


KITTY

You are not troubled?


WALKER

I am certain it will all end soon.


KITTY

Can we speak on other matters then?


WALKER

It would be a relief.


KITTY WALKER takes his arm and whispers in his ear as they 

walk.


KITTY

I am in love.


He looks at his daughter as they turn the corner onto a path 

where they are alone. Kitty beams at his side.


WALKER

I have great reverence for the word 

'love' Kitty. It should not be thrown 

about lightly. It is the greatest 

force on this earth.


KITTY

These feelings are so strong, it can 

be nothing else Papa.


WALKER

I see.


KITTY

You do not believe me.


WALKER

I have no judgment yet.


KITTY

It must have been bubbling inside me 

for a long time, for it came bursting 

forth not three days ago. I have 

thought of nothing since.


Edward nods his head.


WALKER

'Bursting forth' is it?


KITTY

I realized since I'm the eldest of 

your children and since you were 

stricken with five girls and no boys, 

I decided to act as if I were the 

son and ask your permission.


WALKER

I must correct you on the word 

'stricken'. I would not trade any 

one of my five daughters for a hundred 

of the finest boys. So now, what is 

it you are asking permission for?


KITTY

I would like permission to marry, 

Papa.


WALKER

There is a proper manner in which 

these things are to happen. Such as 

the boy would normally be standing 

next to you at a moment such as this. 

Where is the boy in all of this Kitty?


KITTY

I haven't spoken to him as of yet.


Now Edward stops walking.


WALKER

The young man is unaware of your 

intentions?


KITTY

He has a quiet way. I was going to 

talk with him, but I wanted your 

blessings papa. I won't talk with 

him without your blessings.


Edward starts walking again.


WALKER

Kitty --


KITTY

It's Lucius Hunt.


WALKER

-- Lucius?


Kitty sees the expression on her father's face.


KITTY

You think badly of him?


WALKER

No, no... I've just been thinking on 

him recently.


Kitty's face returns to beaming.


KITTY

He's not like the other boys. He 

doesn't joke and bounce about.


WALKER

He certainly doesn't.


KITTY

Do I have your blessings then?


He looks down at his eldest daughter. He nods, "yes."


She hugs him tight as they come to a stop in the far end of 

the courtyard at the base of the medium sized town bell.


WALKER

Do me one favor first Kitty. Do not 

tell anyone else of your 'burstings' 

until you have spoken with the young 

man.


Kitty nods earnestly. Beat. Edward Walker gets lost in his 

thoughts again.


KITTY

(whispers)

Papa, something does trouble you?


Edward looks down and sees the concern in his daughter's 

eyes.


Beat. He then reaches up and pulls long and hard on the rope 

that tolls the brass bell.


We see in the background everyone stops what they're doing 

and begins walking in lines towards the cabins.


We watch as people walk in from the stream and from the 

orchards. They disappear quietly into the cabins.


CUT TO:


EXT. FIELD  AFTERNOON


Lucius stands at the edge of a field of crops. He methodically 

removes the clumps of dirt from the prongs of the tools he's 

used on the soil that day.


KITTY

Good afternoon Lucius.


Lucius' hands stop their work. He turns and looks over his 

shoulder at the young woman that stands before him. She rises 

on her tip-toes and returns to earth again. Lucius never 

lets go of his tools. He nods hello to her.


KITTY

I wanted to tell you something.


Lucius stares.


KITTY

My goodness, my heart is pounding so 

fast, I think I may faint on this 

spot... You'd probably catch me 

course, before I fell.


Lucius continues to stare.


KITTY

Seeing as you're of age... and seeing 

as I'm of age... and seeing as we 

get along so well like this... A 

thought entered my head that may 

have entered your head as well.


Lucius blinks his green eyes. Kitty takes this as a positive 

gesture and smiles sweetly.


KITTY

(soft)

I love you Lucius. I love you like 

the day is long. I love you more 

than the sun and moon together. And 

if you feel the same way, we should 

not hide it any longer. It's a gift, 

love is. We should be thankful. We 

should bellow it with all the breath 

in our lungs, "Thank you! Thank you! 

Thank you!'


Kitty finishes her flurry by rising up on the tips of her 

toes and returning to earth again.


Lucius stares.


CUT TO:


INT. WALKER CABIN  NIGHT


Kitty is wailing.


Edward carries his youngest daughter in his arms as his petite 

wife holds their next two youngest on their laps. They watch 

with concern as Kitty cries loudly from her bedroom Kitty is 

being consoled by her closest sister. Kitty has her head in 

her sister's lap.


IVY WALKER strokes the hair of her older sister gently. Ivy 

is thin, almost too thin. Her long blond hair falls over her 

sharp striking face.


She wipes the tears from her sister's cheeks. Beat. Ivy begins 

to sing softly.


IVY

(sings)

Why are you sorrowful, why do you 

weep? Why do you ask me to rock you 

to sleep? Could you but see thro' 

this world's vale of tears...


Edward and Tabitha Walker hold their three youngest girls 

and listen quietly from the other room.


IVY

(sings)

Light would your sorrows be, harmless 

your fears, all that seems darkness 

to you would be light, all would be 

sunshine where now is but night...


Ivy wipes the last tears from her sister's face. Ivy's voice 

fills the cabin and wraps them all like a blanket.


CUT TO:


INT. AUGUST NICHOLSON'S CABIN  NIGHT


Lucius knocks on the half open door with his elbow. He waits 

a moment and pushes the door open. Lucius carries a large 

pile of firewood in his arms as he steps into the cabin.


He sees the wilting man, August Nicholson, sleeping in a 

chair.


Lucius moves to the hearth. Some of the kindling falls off 

the pile onto the floor. August stirs awake. He sees Lucius 

kneeling with the wood.


AUGUST

You are very kind.


Lucius nods.


AUGUST

You must pardon my manners. I haven't 

slept in many nights.


Lucius nods again and starts making a pile next to the hearth. 

Beat.


AUGUST (O.S.)

-- like a dog can smell you.


Lucius turns. August has his eyes closed. Beat.


LUCIUS

Did you say something Mr. Nicholson?


August doesn't reply. He is fast asleep in the chair.


Lucius returns to the pile. He transfers the last of the 

firewood from his arms.


AUGUST (O.S.)

-- you may run from sorrow. As we 

have. Sorrow will find you.


Lucius turns to see August, eyes open this time, staring 

into the corner of the cabin.


AUGUST

It can smell you.


Lucius follows the elder's gaze to the corner of the room 

where a WOODEN BLACK BOX, one foot by one foot, sits on a 

table all by itself.


Lucius turns back to August.


AUGUST

(reverent)

There were pastries with cream in 

them.


Lucius watches as August Nicholson's eyes slowly close again. 

Beat.


Lucius rises to his feet. He walks across the cabin to the 

door.


AUGUST (O.S.)

-- my wife and I, we used to throw 

dinner parties.


Lucius looks back. August stares sleepily at him.


August's words are so soft, the crackle of the fire almost 

covers them.


AUGUST

(quiet)

-- in town.

(beat)

We served pastries with cream in 

them.


Lucius waits till August is asleep again. The young man's 

green eyes stare quietly at the wilting man.


CUT TO:


EXT. BORDER  NIGHT


We are at the edge of the village. Yellow cloth flags are 

attached to the trees that create the natural border between 

the grassy slopes and the woods. The yellow flags and torch 

lit lamp curve into the distance as far as one can see.


A fifteen-year old boy in overalls stands on a stump right 

at the edge of the grass. His back is to the woods. His arms 

outstretched at his sides. His body makes the form of the 

crucifix. He is trembling.


YOUNG MAN (O.S.)

He has tears in his eyes, Christop.


A group of young men are huddled behind a rock ten feet down 

the slope and watch the fifteen-year old on the stump.


CHRISTOP CRANE is a thin, tall, very neatly combed young 

man.


CHRISTOP

He's doing capitol. Just a few more 

moments...


The young men fight each other for best view.


CHRISTOP

Do not jostle about so. You'll ruin 

my shirt.


The fifteen-year old's eyes are filling with water. He's 

straining to hold up his arms.


WE ARE IN THE DARKNESS OF THE WOODS, WE ARE BEHIND THE BOY, 

WE SEE THE SILHOUETTE OF HIS SLIGHT FIGURE STANDING ON THE 

TREE STUMP.


The boy makes a noise - a slight whimper. A NOISE IS HEARD 

FROM THE WOODS.


The boy stiffens. He whispers out to the boys behind the 

rock.


BOY ON STUMP

(loud whisper)

They made a sound when I made a sound. 

They mimic before they attack.


Christop pops his head out.


CHRISTOP

(loud whisper)

That's a wives tale. It isn't true. 

Do not falter... A few moments more.


A BRANCH SNAPS IN THE WOODS. The fifteen-year old's eyes 

flick up. All the heads from behind the rock peek out.


The boy LISTENS desperately. He wants to look behind, but he 

doesn't.


THERE ARE NOISES IN THE WOODS. THE SOUND OF LEAVES BEING 

CRUNCHED.


The boy begins to shake.


A LARGE BRANCH SNAPS. The fifteen-year old lets out a SMALL 

SQUEAL as he lowers his arms and jumps from the stump. He 

starts running.


He runs past the young men in hiding behind the rock. As he 

does, they start running too. Everyone evacuates in a hurry. 

They all start racing down the slope back to the FIRE LIGHTS 

FLICKERING in the distance from the village.


CUT TO:


INT. VILLAGE COURTYARD  NIGHT


The gang of young men, are moving at a fast walk through the 

courtyard, trying to catch their breath. The fifteen-year 

old walks in the center receiving various pats on the back. 

His face is still ashen.


The group walks by a contemplative Lucius.


He doesn't look up as they pass in a flurry of youthful 

conversation.


Lucius moves silently in the opposite direction, the weight 

on his shoulders, almost visible.


CUT TO:


EXT. SCHOOLYARD FIELD  DAY


The mentally handicapped young man we saw clapping at the 

supper table is wrestling in the dirt with two young men who 

try to restrain him. He is strong and quick. The two young 

men end up in the dirt over and over as the mentally 

handicapped young man slips them and throws them down.


The children watch the dust and dirt kick up as the three 

continue scuffling.


CUT TO:


EXT. SCHOOLHOUSE - DAY


A trail of dark blood runs down the forehead of a hysterical 

child. Kitty gently escorts him off the playground.


They pass Ivy seated on a bench that overlooks the back of 

the schoolyard.


Kitty speaks over her shoulder as she climbs the steps into 

the school building.


KITTY

Noah ought to be punished. He wacked 

little Joseph with a stick again.


Ivy nods. Kitty and JOSEPH disappear into the school building.


Ivy takes hold of the wooden cane lying next to her. She 

rises from the bench. She moves towards the NOISE OF THE 

PLAYGROUND. The wooden cane moves deftly back and forth in 

front of her.


Her STRIKING BLIND EYES focus on nothing.


CUT TO:


EXT. SCHOOLYARD  DAY


The wrestling has gotten fierce. NOAH PERCY is almost pinned 

when he suddenly throws them and frees himself. The two young 

men immediately go for his legs.


IVY

Noah Percy, stop your fussing right 

this moment.


Noah stops and stares at Ivy.


The two young men on the ground stop. They realize they are 

holding each other's leg.


Noah stands as the two young men lie on the ground. Noah 

smiles sweetly at Ivy.


CUT TO:


EXT. QUIET ROOM  DAY


A heavy lock is undone. The tall wooden door swings open. We 

look into a small cabin. It has only one room. It has a wooden 

chair in the center. A few potato sacks have been piled in 

the corner. The room is dusty.


Ivy and Noah stand and look in. Noah holds her arm.


IVY

You're in trouble you know?


NOAH

No hitting.


IVY

I'm to place you in the quiet room.


NOAH

-- I'll cry quarts.


IVY

What if we strike a deal?


NOAH

Capitol! Capitol idea!


IVY

It would be prudent to keep our deal 

a secret. Can you do that?


NOAH

Like a church mouse.


This makes Ivy laugh. Noah laughs too.


IVY

You needn't go to the quiet room if 

you take an oath to never strike any 

person again.


NOAH

No hitting.


Ivy puts out her hand to shake.


IVY

No hitting.


Noah shakes hands, up and down big, like the elders do.


Ivy taps her cheek. Noah leans down, for he stands a good 

six inches taller than her, and kisses softly once.


IVY

The deal is struck.


Noah is beaming. Ivy closes the door to the quiet room.


IVY

We ought not return right away. What 

shall we do with our stolen time?

(beat)

Shall we have a foot race? Up the 

hill to the resting rock.


NOAH

No cheating.


IVY

What a deeply scandalous thing to 

say. I insist you take that back... 

Is that the school bell?


Noah looks back. Ivy takes off. She's a good ten feet down 

the path before he turns to see her not there.


CUT TO:


EXT. RESTING ROCK  DAY


Noah is bigger, stronger and faster, but he has a hard time 

catching the blind young woman running ahead of him. She 

moves effortlessly. She does not use her stick. She knows 

every step of these hills. She taps a tree as she runs by. 

She is laughing as she runs.


Noah passes her just as they finish. They both are out of 

breath as they reach the rock formation.


One rock juts out at the base of an enormous wall of rock 

buried into the side of the hill. There is shade here. This 

is Resting Rock.


There is someone sitting there when they arrive. Noah goes 

right over and sits with him. Ivy sits and catches her breath 

before looking in their direction.


IVY

My sister cried a lot.


Lucius stops eating the biscuit he has wrapped in his 

handkerchief for his lunch break. Beat.


IVY

Do you wonder how I recognized you.


Lucius stares at the striking girl with the sweaty face and 

messed hair.


IVY

Some people, just a handful mind 

you, give off the tiniest color. 

It's faint, like a haze. It's the 

only thing I ever see in the darkness. 

Papa has it too.


Lucius gazes quietly at Ivy as if she was a sorcerer. Noah 

just smiles. Beat.


IVY

Do you wonder what your color is? 

Well that, I won't tell you. It's 

not ladylike to speak of such things. 

You shouldn't even have asked.


Lucius fights a smile. Noah runs off after some nearby birds.


Ivy smoothes her wrinkled, dusty frock. It is an 

uncharacteristic nervous gesture.


IVY

(serious)

I know why you denied my sister.


Lucius' smile melts away.


IVY

When I was younger you used to hold 

my arm when I walked. Then suddenly 

you stopped.

(beat)

One day, I even tripped in your 

presence and nearly fell. I was faking 

of course, but still you did not 

hold me. Sometimes we don't do things 

we want to do, so that others won't 

know we want to do them.


Lucius is about to say something when Noah comes back. Noah 

sits down between them. Lucius turns his piercing eyes back 

to his biscuit.


Noah reaches into his pocket. He clutches something in his 

hand. He puts it into Ivy's lap.


IVY

What's this?


She feels it in her hands.


IVY

A flower, what a splendid present.


Lucius glances over. He goes still. Beat.


LUCIUS

(low)

Be cautious. You are holding the bad 

color.


Ivy's face changes as she holds the RED FLOWER.


IVY

(even)

Noah it is not allowed. This color 

attracts Those We Don't Speak Of. 

You must bury it.


She holds it out to a saddened Noah. Her hand is trembling 

slightly. He takes it back after a moment.


IVY

You ought not to pick that color 

flower anymore.


Lucius gazes at the flower in Noah's hand.


LUCIUS

He did not pick that now.


Beat. Ivy's head turns a quarter turn towards Lucius.


IVY

What's wrong? You're breathing has 

changed.


LUCIUS

I've never set eyes on such a flower.


Lucius and Noah look at each other. Beat.


LUCIUS

(quiet)

Noah... where did you find this?


CUT TO:


EXT. BORDER  AFTERNOON


Ivy's fingers trace along Noah's arm. She finds his hand. 

She moves over his finger that is pointing. She turns and 

faces that direction.


Beat.


IVY

Are you sure?


Noah nods.


NOAH

No cheating.


Ivy, Noah, and Lucius stand at the top of the hill and stare. 

Beat. Lucius turns and starts walking down the hill.


LUCIUS (V.O.)

My mother is unaware of the reason 

for my visit today. She did not give 

her consent --


CUT TO:


INT. MEETING HALL - AFTERNOON


WALKER

Lucius.


Lucius' green eyes look up from his paper.


WALKER

You do not need to address us so  

formally. You may just speak.


Lucius stares at the group of elders seated on the wooden 

chairs before him. Alice watches her son lower the paper at 

his side. He just stands there. Beat.


LUCIUS

We mustn't --


Lucius eyes drift down. He tilts the paper slightly as he 

tries to read the words at a steep angle at his side.


LUCIUS

We mustn't --


Edward smiles.


WALKER

Lucius, you may read from the paper 

if you wish.


Lucius brings the paper back up.


LUCIUS

-- or consult me in any form.

(beat)

Today at Resting Rock. Noah Percy 

handed Ivy Walker a flower of the 

bad color.


Edward Walker sits up just a bit at the sound of his 

daughter's name.


LUCIUS

When asked where he found this flower, 

for it was not like others I have 

seen, he took us there. He led us to 

the peak of the hill, by the tree 

stump. There he pointed to a bush 

covered in flowers of the bad color.


Lucius looks up. He doesn't look down when he says the next 

six words.


LUCIUS

He was pointing into Covington Woods.


Lucius returns his eyes to the paper.


LUCIUS

By my eye, the bush of the bad color 

was, at the very least, seventy-five 

paces past the forbidden line.


Beat.


LUCIUS

It is my belief that Noah Percy has 

entered the woods, and has done so 

on many occasions. It is also my 

belief, that because of his innocence, 

those creatures who reside in the 

woods did not harm him.

(beat)

This strengthens my belief  that 

they will let me pass if they sense 

I am not a threat. I ask for further 

consideration in my request to travel 

into the woods so that I may gather 

medicines and informations from the 

nearby town.


Lucius slowly lowers his paper. He exhales very slowly. The 

elders just stare.


CUT TO:


EXT. SCHOOLYARD  AFTERNOON


Noah makes monster sounds. He holds his hands up like claws 

as he slowly chases the pack of laughing and screaming 

children around the playground.


The group of elders have gathered at the edge of  the 

schoolyard. They watch Noah carefully as he runs around with 

the other children.


Noah bares his teeth and growls as he catches one of the 

laughing ten-year-old boys in the pack. Noah picks him up 

and throws him to the ground hard. The child starts crying.


TEACHER

Noah Percy!


Noah stops acting like a monster. He runs and hides behind 

the other children.


The elders watch as the teacher pull Noah off the schoolyard. 

Noah is throwing a slight tantrum as he is led to his 

punishment.


CUT TO:


INT. HUNT CABIN  NIGHT


Alice Hunt sits at her small table. Hands folded on her lap.


ALICE

We shall speak of the town, just 

this once, and we shall never speak 

of it again.


Lucius sits across from her. His eyes flicker from the lamp 

light on the shelf.


ALICE

When we lived there, the three of 

us, you were but an infant. I would 

be telling an untruth if I said there 

was no joy. We were contented souls: 

the three of us... But contentment 

is an unwelcomed alien in the towns. 

There is something in the very nature 

of the cities and towns that rejects 

it. Society survives on greed, and 

desire. Its heart is fed by wants. 

It has no place for something so 

untradable and old fashioned as 

contentment.

(beat)

Your father left for the market on a 

Tuesday at quarter past nine in the 

morning... He was found robbed and 

naked in the river two days later.


Lucius is shaking.


LUCIUS

(barely audible)

Why do you tell me this blackness?


ALICE

So you will know the nature of what 

you desire.


LUCIUS

I do not desire it!


Alice is sincerely unsettled by the sight of her son on the 

verge of yelling.


LUCIUS

My intentions are true to my word. I 

think of nothing but the people of 

this village.


Alice lowers her eyes. Beat. She speaks in a softer voice.


ALICE

I know that. Forgive me. I am but 

scared for my only son's life.


LUCIUS

I am not the one with secrets.


Alice's eyes lock on his.


ALICE

What is your meaning?

(beat)

Speak! Do not retreat to your silence 

yet.


Lucius stands from the table. He moves across the small room.


LUCIUS

There are secrets in every corner of 

this village. Do you not feel it? Do 

you not see it?


Lucius points to the black box seated in the corner of the 

room on a small table. It is identical to the one we saw in 

August Nicholson's house.


ALICE

That is for our own well being. So 

the things that scare us do not have 

power over us.


LUCIUS

Then let us open it.


ALICE

No --


Alice looks ready to rise from her chair to stop him. Lucius 

doesn't move. Beat.


Alice visibly composes herself. Her hands return to her lap.


ALICE

(soft)

Perhaps we should speak with Edward 

Walker together. He may --


LUCIUS

He hides too.


Alice stares quietly at the stranger before her.


LUCIUS

(soft)

He hides his feelings for you.


Alice instantly rises from the table and moves into her room 

with great dignity.


LUCIUS

(calls to her)

Sometimes we don't do things -- yet 

others know we want to do things -- 

so we don't do them.


Lucius doesn't even understand what he said. Alice walks 

back out of her room.


ALICE

What nonsense are you saying?


Lucius is flustered. He gathers his thoughts and looks to 

his mother. Beat.


LUCIUS

You needn't worry. Nothing will happen 

to me.


Alice gazes upon her son.


ALICE

(gentle)

You remind me of a colt sometimes.


Alice moves back to the chair she started in. Lucius takes 

his seat across from her. Beat.


Alice cleans some dust off the table as she speaks.


ALICE

What makes you think he has feelings 

for me?


Beat. Lucius thinks of other things as he says the words.


LUCIUS

He never touches you.


Alice shakes her head, "No" to herself. They both sit at the 

table plowing through their own thoughts. CANDLELIGHT flickers 

on this painting of a mother and son at a wooden table.


CUT TO:


EXT. BORDER  DAY


We are at the edge, where the grass ends and the woods begin. 

On every tree that touches the grass is a yellow slash of 

paint. Every fourth tree holds a flag of the same color.


Two young men replace a broken flag. They both wear hooded 

cloaks that touch the ground. The cloaks are a mustard-yellow.


The young man, who has been boosted up, loses his balance. 

He quickly grabs a branch and steadiest himself. He looks 

down to his partner. They share a tension filled look as 

they glance into the forest. They work as if they are on a 

tight wire.


A third young man in a mustard yellow cloak passes them. 

Lucius carries a wooden bucket of yellow paint. He nods to 

them as he passes.


Lucius walks along the perimeter of trees. He stops a handful 

of trees down the line. The paint on this tree is fading. 

Lucius dips the handmade brush into the bucket and puts 

another coat on the tree.


He picks up his bucket and continues on. He glances over his 

shoulder as the figures of the two young men get smaller and 

smaller. Lucius keeps walking.


He passes the large tree stump.


Now he slows to a stop again. He looks to the woods... Seventy 

five paces away from where he stands, nestled between two 

thin trees, is A BUSH BLOOMING WITH RED FLOWERS.


He looks down the line of trees to the two young men; they 

move along the perimeter and slowly move out of sight.


Lucius steps to the edge of the grass. His shoes are inches 

away from the dirt of the forest floor. In the dirt, clearly 

visible to the eye, are groups of LARGE CLAWED FOOTPRINTS. 

The indentations from the claw points dig deep into the soil.


Lucius does not acknowledge any of this. He stares quietly 

into the woods, lowers his bucket to the ground. Beat.


HE STEPS OVER THE FORBIDDEN LINE INTO COVINGTON WOODS.


Lucius takes the last few steps to the bush. He reaches into 

it and snaps off a branch. He straightens up.


And then for the first time we sense him pausing.


He turns and looks slowly over his shoulder.


THERE IS SUDDEN MOVEMENT. LEAVES AND BRANCHES SNAP AS WE 

SEE, FIFTY FEET AWAY, THE DARK FORM OF A HUMPED CREATURE, 

STANDING UPRIGHT. IT SUDDENLY MOVES. WE SEE IT STRIDE AWAY 

INTO THE DENSENESS OF THE WOODS.


Lucius turns and starts walking. Branch in hand, he moves at 

a calm even pace as he heads back to the bucket with yellow 

paint.


CUT TO:


EXT. WALKING PATH  NIGHT


Lucius moves along a walking path. He passes by a LAMP LIGHT.


He gets pulled from the strong current of his thoughts by 

the rattling of a bush. He sees someone crawling around in 

the foliage.


GIRL'S VOICE FROM BUSH

There is no escape.


Lucius watches as Ivy Walker crawls out and stands. She looks 

in Lucius' direction.


IVY

Oh, Hello.


Ivy runs her hands over her frock. Dirt and leaves fall off.


IVY

I was just playing a game with Noah. 

The rascal must have gone to hide in 

my house again. Houses are against 

the rules. He knows that.


Lucius stares at Ivy who has dirt and leaves in her hair. 

She bends down and picks up her cane.


IVY

Are you okay? Your quiet is a 

different quiet than your usual quiet.


Lucius nods.


IVY

I assume you're nodding.


Ivy smiles.


IVY

Well I better get back home and 

confront the scoundrel.

(beat)

You could walk with me if you like.


There is an awkward moment.


CUT TO:


EXT. WALKER BACK PORCH  NIGHT


Ivy and Lucius arrive in silence to the back porch of the 

Walker cabin. In the LAMP LIT windows we see Kitty and her 

younger sister talking.


IVY

We were tending to the children 

tonight, Kitty and I... I should be 

with her.

(beat)

Be well.


Ivy climbs the stairs and stops.


IVY

I heard my parents speaking of you. 

I know of  your request to go to the 

towns. I think it is noble, but I do 

not think it is right.


Beat.


LUCIUS

There may be things we do not know 

that may help us.


IVY

You speak as if we are plagued. There 

is nothing to cure.


Beat.


LUCIUS

Are you not angry you have no sight? 

Perhaps your eyes could have been 

saved as a child by knowledge held 

in the town's medicines.


IVY

I know it upset Papa very much when 

it happened to me. He would not speak 

for three days I was told. But it 

does not bother me Lucius.


LUCIUS

What of Noah then? What if there was 

medicines for Noah that could help 

him be still? Help him learn?


Beat. This affects Ivy.


IVY

May we stop speaking of this? It is 

putting knots in my stomach.


Lucius nods. Ivy climbs a few more steps and stops. She turns.


IVY

Kitty is to be married.


Lucius looks a little confused.


IVY

She has found love again. With 

Christop Crane.


Lucius raises his eyebrows.


IVY

(soft)

You think it an odd choice right? 

You know he won't sit back in his 

chair for fear of setting wrinkles 

his shirt.

(beat)

But he does have a gentlemanly way 

about him and he does care for my 

sister deeply. I think Kitty is 

blessed. I am blessed as well... My 

older sister is now spoken for. I am 

now free to receive interest from 

anyone... who might have interest.


Lucius stares at the striking blind girl who stands in the 

shadows with a mischievous smile.


IVY

(soft)

Goodnight Lucius Hunt.


Ivy turns and walks into the house. We see through the open 

back door as Noah leaps out from behind a water basin and 

scares her. Ivy starts chasing the tall boy around the room 

playfully.


CUT TO:


EXT. TOWER  NIGHT


Finton Coin sits huddled in the corner of the tower perch. 

His knees are tucked into his chest. There is an oil lamp on 

the floor by his side.


The oil lamp moves as the tower creaks. Finton sits up. THE 

LAMP LIGHT ON FINTON'S TENSE FACE FLICKERS AND THEN RETURNS.


FINTON

Lucius?


SILENCE. Finton crawls over to the trap door in the floor. 

He listens a moment before reaching for the rope handle.


He pulls back the wooden door slowly.


Finton looks down the ladder that drops twenty feet away to 

the ground. The thick legs of the tower can also be seen.


FINTON

Lucius?


SOMETHING PASSES UNDERNEATH. IT IS DARK IN FORM AND MOVES 

DEVILISHLY QUICK INTO THE SHADOWS.


All the air leaves Finton Coin's lungs.


Finton shuts the trap door quietly. He moves the wooden bolt 

into the lock position. All his movements are slow and 

trancelike.


Finton places his hands on the railing and pulls himself up. 

He steadies himself on his feet. And then peers over the 

railing.


CUT TO:


EXT. COURTYARD  NIGHT


People of the village move normally through the courtyard.


AND THEN THE WARNING BELL SOUNDS IN THE DISTANCE. IT IS VERY 

DIFFERENT THAN THE PRACTICE BELL IN THE YARD. ITS SOUND IS 

DEEPER MORE POWERFUL AND RESONANT. ITS SHORT REPEATED RINGING 

ECHOES THROUGH THE AIR.


Everyone in the courtyard suddenly freezes and then starts 

running.


Everyone except Lucius. He turns and looks over his shoulder 

towards the direction of the tower.


CUT TO:


INT. WALKER CABIN  NIGHT


Kitty and Ivy look up as they dress their little sisters for 

bed.


THE DISTANT REPEATED SOUND OF THE WARNING BELL silences all 

the chatter.


Beat.


Kitty turns to Ivy.


KITTY

(low)

Close all the doors.


Kitty scoops her little sisters off their bed and moves 

directly towards the trapdoor in the back of the cabin.


CUT TO:


EXT. CABINS  NIGHT


Lucius ushers a group of people into a cabin. He closes the 

door and shuts them in. He moves quickly across the path to 

a woman who tries desperately to close the shutters on her 

cabin. The shutters stick on their rusty hinges. Lucius comes 

over and closes it shut.


He turns as a SHADOW PASSES OVER HIM.


Lucius ducks into the darkness by the side of the cabin. 

There is movement all around him.


HE WATCHES AS A CREATURE MOVES SLOWLY TOWARDS THE FRONT DOOR 

OF THE CABIN.


Lucius steps back farther into the shadows. He presses his 

back against the side of the cabin and loses sight of the 

creature.


CUT TO:


INT. WALKER CABIN  NIGHT


Noah jumps up and down, agitated and excited. Kitty tugs at 

his arm as she pulls him towards the trap door. She looks 

across the cabin and sees Ivy standing in the open front 

door.


KITTY

(yells)

You must close the door!


Ivy looks out in the direction of the STRANGE SOUNDS.


IVY

Lucius is out walking.


Kitty leads Noah down into the crawl space where the two 

younger sisters wait frightened and silent.


KITTY

(yells)

He's inside safe somewhere. Close 

the door!


Ivy turns and looks back at her sister, strain and strength 

on her face.


IVY

He'll come back to make sure we're 

safe.


Kitty walks down into the underground room with Noah and the 

children. Only her head can be seen as she watches her little 

sister, across the cabin stand in the doorway to the outside.


Ivy puts out her hand through the open doorway. She holds it 

out to the darkness.


THE WARNING BELL RINGS OVER AND OVER IN THE DISTANCE.


STRANGE SOUNDS CAN BE HEARD THROUGH THE WALLS IN THE BACK OF 

THE CABIN.


Kitty listens to them, tears fill her eyes. Her head turns 

back to Ivy and screams across the cabin floor.


KITTY

Ivy please!


OUTSIDE:


THERE ARE SHADOWS ALL AROUND THE WALKER CABIN.


A HUMPED CREATURE EMERGES FROM THE DARKNESS. IT STARTS RUSHING 

TOWARDS THE PORCH.


Ivy holds her hand out as she stares blankly into the darkness 

outside. Tears stream down her face. She is terrified.


IVY

(soft)

No.


KITTY

Don't let them in!


THE LARGE DARKENED FIGURE OF THE CREATURE CLIMBS ONTO THE 

PORCH.


A HAND GRABS IVY'S HAND.


SLOW-MOTION: Ivy turns as Lucius moves with her through the 

doorway. They close the door shut quickly and bolt it. Lucius 

and Ivy run together across the cabin. Lucius never lets go 

of her hand.


They reach the open trapdoor. Lucius helps Ivy in and then 

follows her down. His arm spears out and grabs hold of the 

rope handle. The door shuts over their heads.


CUT TO:


INT. UNDERGROUND ROOM  NIGHT


REAL TIME:


Six individuals huddle together in the darkness. A TINY STREAM 

OF LIGHT FALLS ON THEIR FACES.


SOUNDS OF SCRATCHING AND CLAWING CAN BE HEARD ON THE WALLS 

OF THE CABIN. THE DISTANT SOUND OF THE WARNING BELL IS MUFFLED 

IN THIS UNDERGROUND SPACE.


Kitty holds her little sister tight. Noah claps his hands 

joyously in the small space he has to move.


Lucius and Ivy are crouched together close to the stairs. 

Their faces are almost touching. They both stare up at the 

crack in the door and listen. They both breathe hard; their 

breath falling on each other.


Ivy's face tilts slowly to her lap. Lucius' hand is still 

holding hers.


CUT TO:


INT. UNDER GROUND ROOM #2  NIGHT


A large number of men and women are crammed together in 

another underground room.


THEY LISTEN AS NOISES AND GRUNTS MOVE AROUND THEM OVERHEAD.


CUT TO:


INT. UNDERGROUND ROOM #3  NIGHT


A group of children are huddled together in the darkness of 

another underground room. The children's hands cover their 

ears. They try to block out the SOUNDS STABBING AT THEM 

THROUGH THE CRACKS IN THE TRAP DOOR.


We see their tiny bodies jerk with every sound.


Their scared faces dissolve into the darkness.


FADE TO BLACK:


CUT TO:


EXT. VILLAGE  DAY


A gentle breeze pushes leaves around in circles. There is no 

one in the courtyard. There is no one on the walking path.


The front doors of the cabins ate closed. On each door are 

TWO RED SLASHES OF COLOR FORMING AN "X". The crimson markings 

are seen throughout the empty village.


CUT TO:


INT. MEETING HALL  DAY


All members of the village, young and old, are gathered 

together. THE SOUND OF SOME CHILDREN WHIMPERING can be heard 

in the tense silence.


Edward looks at the faces.


WALKER

We may question ourselves at times 

such as these. Did we make the right 

decision to settle here? We must 

remember why we came here. It was 

for goodness and a rare type of 

innocence. That is worth a struggle 

I think.

(beat)

Let it be known for all to comfort 

in, that no person was injured lat 

night. We have always had, from the 

day we settled here, a gentle 

understanding with those who visited 

us.

(beat)

I have always pictured them, in some 

ways, as our protectors. They have 

allowed us to live here nestled 

amongst them in this untouched place.

(beat)

By the markings we find this morning 

on our homes, I feel they were warning 

us. They acted as if threatened. We 

will do our best to discover what it 

is that has set them to action.


Beat. Edward suddenly looks older. His childlike eyes flicker 

with emotion.


WALKER

(soft)

I myself wonder if this simple way 

of life can go on... If it was meant 

too...


August touches him on the shoulder in a brotherly way to 

stop him from speaking. August looks out over the 

congregation.


AUGUST

If any want to talk of their worries 

or concerns, we would welcome them.


A note is passed from the gathering. Vivian Percy is the 

closest of the elders and accepts it. She checks the front 

and back for an inscription. She looks out over the room of 

faces.


VIVIAN

Who has written this note?


The room of faces do not respond. Vivian opens it.


Vivian turns to the elders at her side.


VIVIAN

It is the wish of the writer for 

this to be read aloud.


They all nod. Vivian throws a quick look to Alice before 

turning back to the paper.


VIVIAN

(reading)

Please read so that all may hear.

(beat)

My mother is unaware that I wrote 

this note. She did not give her 

consent or consult me in any form.

(beat)

I have brought this burden upon us. 

On the day before last, I crossed 

the forbidden line into Covington 

Woods and was witnessed there by 

Those We Don't Speak Of.


Whispers fill the meeting hall. Alice closes her eyes. August 

looks down.


VIVIAN

(reading)

I am deeply sorry. I have shamed 

myself and my family. I pray that my 

actions will cause no further pains.

(beat)

With deepest sorrow, Lucius Hunt.


Ivy sits in the crowd. She stares blankly at a point in space.


There are nothing but murmurs for a moment. Edward Walker 

silently steps forward. The crowd moves aside as he walks 

through them.


He moves to the back corner, where the crowd parts and reveals 

Lucius sitting against the wall. His eyes are red. Tears 

fall from his cheeks.


Edward Walker kneels down in front of him.


WALKER

Do not fret.


Walker's face trembles with emotion as he stares at the young 

man. Edward Walker leans forward and whispers in the young 

man's ear.


WALKER

(barely audible)

You are fearless in a way, I shall 

never know.


Lucius looks up. The two men stare at each other. The crowd 

goes quiet around them. The overwhelming pride and emotion 

in Edward Walker's eyes slowly start to change Lucius. He 

grows stronger with every second he gazes at his elder.

Vivian Percy claps her hands.


MRS. PERCY

Ta. Tee-tee. Ta.


CLASS

Ta. Tee-tee. Ta


MRS. PERCY

Splendid. Shall we take it from the 

first phrase of the song?


She stares at the quiet faces of the children.


MRS. PERCY

It has been difficult to concentrate, 

I admit. The visit from Those We 

Don't Speak Of three weeks past, are 

still with us... I know some of you 

are frightened still. This is why 

our job is so vital. We must lift 

everyone's spirits. Kitty Walker's 

wedding will be a glorious time. We 

will sing and dance and be merry 

again. Now let us be strong little 

souls and begin the song again from 

the very beginning.


The children nod gently. They are ready.


CUT TO:


EXT. CLEARING  DAY


A collection of fifteen men and women are constructing a 

wooden canopy.


Noah Percy helps cut a rope that tethers one of the frames 

of the canopy to a statue in the ground. An elder holds the 

rope and points. Noah slices it. He laughs when the rope 

splits. He waves the knife in the air joyously. The elder 

quickly takes the knife away from him and smiles.


Edward and Tabitha Walker guide the others as the two sides 

of the canopy-frame are brought up into their standing 

positions.


They look up at the structure for their daughter's wedding 

with wonder in their eyes. Beat.


They are gathered by the others and begin tying garlands of 

flowers to the frame.


CUT TO:


EXT. RESTING ROCK  DAY


Lucius unwraps his biscuit from his handkerchief.


IVY (O.S.)

I know you have been ignoring me.


Lucius looks up to find Ivy standing before him.


IVY

It is the day of my sister's wedding 

and I am beginning to believe you 

would let the day pass without saying 

a word to me.


Lucius doesn't say a word.


IVY

Perhaps you sensed I was angry when 

you revealed you crossed into the 

woods. In fact I was. If you want to 

act foolish, that is your choice. 

But I do not find any reason to risk 

such dangers in the woods for 

anything. It was wrong.

(beat)

I say this as your friend, because 

friends may say anything to each 

other.


Ivy lets out a breath.


IVY

I'm glad we've had a chance to talk.

(beat)

Kitty needs help getting ready. Enjoy 

your biscuit.


Ivy turns and walks away. Lucius' green eyes watch her as 

her as he brings the biscuit to his mouth.


CUT TO:


EXT. SUPPERTABLE  AFTERNOON


WALKER

We came here to start anew -- We are 

grateful for the time we have been 

given.


Edward Walker looks to Kitty at his side. Christop sits across 

from her. They are both dressed in white. Edward smiles to 

them as he takes a seat.


August stands. It is unexpected. Eyes watch him.


AUGUST

These are the experiences we came 

here to have. This is good. This is 

pure.


Beat. August takes a seat.


The table is covered in a feast of foods. Hands start reaching 

across the table. The business of a festive dinner begins.


DISSOLVE TO:


EXT. BORDER  AFTERNOON


The SOUND OF WOODEN FLUTES AND HAND MADE INSTRUMENTS CAN BE 

HEARD IN THE AIR.


Two young girls in mustard yellow cloaks lead two young men 

in hooded cloaks. The girls walk procession-like with flowers 

in their hands, The two young men carry a wooden box with 

rope handles.


The group stops ten feet from the border into the forest. 

The girls turn ceremonially together and wait for the young 

men to open the lid of the one-foot by one-foot square box. 

The girls then toss their flowers in the box and step aside.


The young men raise the hoods of their cloaks over their 

heads. The lid is closed and the box is picked up by it's 

handles again. The girls stay where they are as the young 

men carry the box right to the edge of the forest.


There the lid is reopened. The two young men reach down and 

pull out the contents of the box. The flowers the girls threw 

in the box, trickle off the blood red surface of the LARGE 

SLAB OF MEAT.


The two hoods turn and look into the forest. About five feet 

into the forest is a large flat rock. Its surface is stained 

dark from dried animal blood.


The young men start swinging the meat to gain momentum. On 

the third swing, they throw the large slab of meat into the 

air and over the forbidden boundary. It makes a SOUND as it 

lands on the rock.


The young men glance at the forest for a moment, and then 

turn and walk back to the girls. They turn and start walking 

in a procession back down the hill and towards the MUSIC.


CUT TO:


EXT. CANOPY  AFTERNOON


A canopy of flowers and vines has been made on the grass 

next to the stream. Candles hung by string are tied 

throughout.


A quartet of young musicians play on stools. Vivian Percy 

and the children sing next to them.


Kitty is dressed in a beautiful simple white frock. Christop 

looks neat and handsome. They stand on either side of August 

Nicholson who holds a weathered book in his hands. He quietly 

quietly instructs the couple where to stand and what to do 

The some of the guests are seated in wooden chairs, some are 

seated in the grass.


Ivy is seated on the grass nearby with an older woman with 

thick gray hair. We have seen this woman sitting with the 

elders many times. This is MRS. CLACK.


MRS. CLACK

(whispers)

I had an elder sister.


Ivy turns to Mrs. Clack and smiles.


IVY

(whispers)

Mrs. Clack, you have been keeping 

secrets.


MRS. CLACK

(whispers)

Kitty reminds me of her so.


IVY

(whispers)

What manner of person was she?


MRS. CLACK

(smiles)

Saucy. We fought endlessly.


IVY

(smiles)

May I ask her name?


Beat.


MRS. CLACK

Your father created a miracle here 

in this place. Sheltered us from 

darkness.


Ivy can hear the change in Mrs. Clack's voice.


IVY

Why did she not come to Covington 

Woods?


MRS. CLACK

My sister did not live past her twenty-

third birthday. A group of men took 

her life in an alley by our home.


Mrs. Clack fixes her frock with her puffy hands.


August Nicholson turns to the congregation. He calls out.


AUGUST

Please rise.


Everyone in chairs and on the grass stands for the ceremony.


CUT TO:


EXT. CANOPY - NIGHT


The MUSIC IS LIVELY. The musicians are up on their feet. 

People are dancing.


Kitty and Christop stand side by side and greet each family 

of the village. They are presented handmade gifts wrapped in 

twine. Kitty is glowing as she accepts the wedding gifts.


Ivy steps up and hugs her sister tight. Kitty hugs her back 

and lets go. Ivy keeps hugging. Kitty realizes Ivy is crying. 

Ivy kisses Kitty on the cheek and finally lets go. Kitty 

watch with confusion as her sister moves away.


CHRISTOP

She's not going to squeeze my shirt 

like that is she?


Kitty forces a smile and accepts the next gift.


CUT TO:


EXT. CANOPY ENTRANCE  NIGHT


Edward and Tabitha Walker greet the elders that swarm around 

them and congratulate them.


Alice Hunt steps up and kisses Tabitha. She moves to Edward 

who finishes shaking a man's hand.


ALICE

Many blessings on this most joyous 

of days.


Alice puts out her hand.


EDWARD

It was a rare and lovely ceremony, 

was it not?


ALICE

Glorious. I saw your hand move to 

your eyes on more than one occasion.


EDWARD

Must have been dust of some matter.


Edward smiles at her. Alice smiles gently back.


She lowers her untouched hand back to her side. They both 

nod at each other. Alice steps away.


She is flustered. She holds her hands nervously as she walks. 

Alice turns and glances back over her shoulder.


Edward Walker is greeting Vivian Percy. HE SHAKES HER HAND 

as she congratulates him.


Alice turns back and keeps walking. She looks around to see 

if anyone is watching her. Her face is bright red with 

embarrassment.


CUT TO:


EXT. CANOPY  NIGHT


The swirl of dancing captures more and more people.


Ivy stands to the side. Kitty's hand reaches out from the 

dancers. Kitty takes hold of her sister and pulls her in. 

Ivy resists for a moment and then lets herself join the 

celebration.


CUT TO:


EXT. BORDER  DUSK


Long deep shadows fall in the woods.


The two young men in yellow hooded cloaks walk the final 

steps to the edge of the forest. They look to the flat stained 

rock in the woods. THE SLAB OF MEAT HAS BEEN REMOVED. A fresh 

stain sits where the raw meat used to be.


The young men turn quietly and head back to the little girls. 

They lower their hoods. They nod their heads to the girls 

who then smile. The four start walking towards the music in 

two lines of two.


CUT TO:


EXT. SLOPE TO CANOPY  NIGHT


Lucius Hunt sits along the slope that leads to the wedding 

canopy. THE MUSIC AND LAUGHTER FLOAT THROUGH THE AIR.


He looks down to the CANDLELIT GLOW of the flowered canopy. 

Almost everyone is dancing.


SOMETHING MOVES IN THE DARKNESS BEHIND HIM.


Lucius looks back over his shoulder.


THERE IS A RUSTLE IN THE BUSHES ON THE SLOPE ABOVE HIM.


Beat.


LUCIUS

Who's come to visit me?


A LOW GRUNT. WE SUDDENLY HEAR SOUNDS OF SCURRYING.


Lucius rises to his feet immediately.


CUT TO:


EXT. CANOPY  NIGHT


Ivy is in the thicket part of the dancing. Her hair has come 

loose from its upturned position. She laughs as she turns in 

circles with her sister and friends.


THE FIRST SCREAM MIXES WITH THE LAUGHTER AND DISAPPEARS.


The dancing goes on.


THE SECOND SCREAM CAN BE HEARD MUCH MORE CLEARLY.


Ivy is among the first few who stop dancing.


CUT TO:


EXT. SLOPE TO CANOPY  NIGHT


Lucius leans down and picks up an oil lamp that has been 

knocked to the ground. It is one of a few that have been 

strung along a walking path.


Lucius looks to Covington Woods in the distance. THERE IS 

THE DISTANT SOUND OF BRANCHES SNAPPING.


Lucius turns as the SOUND OF A SCREAM CUTS THROUGH THE MUSICAL 

DIN FROM BELOW.


He stares down at the warm glow of the canopy. He can see 

everyone has stopped dancing. There is commotion.


Lucius wheels in the direction of the tower. We see a young 

man in a yellow cloak standing sentry. We see him standing 

bored - elbows on the edge of the railing.


Lucius watches him for a moment, then turns back confused.


CUT TO:


EXT. CANOPY  NIGHT


The dance floor is full of confusion.


A few YELLS SPIKE THE AIR.


Ivy is unintentionally bumped a few times as people start 

panicking. She is separated from her sister.


Ivy puts her arms out. She tries to move out of the knot of 

people.


PANICKED CONVERSATIONS GET LOUDER ALL AROUND HER.


She is bumped two more times. She struggles to keep moving 

in the crowd.


A HAND TAKES HOLD OF HERS. She feels Lucius leading her out 

of the congestion. She holds his hand tight as they move 

towards the entrance of the canopy.


CUT TO:


EXT. CANOPY ENTRANCE  NIGHT


Lucius and Ivy emerge amongst a group of elders that are 

gathered around two young boys. The boys are around ten years 

old. They are terrified. Everyone close at hand listens in 

hushed silence.


Edward Walker is seated in a chair. The boys stand before 

him at eye level.


BOY

They are in the village.


EDWARD

It cannot be.


BOY

It saw us. It ran off into the 

darkness.


WALKER

You are certain?


The boys nod. They are both crying. Beat.


Ivy moves next to her father. Edward takes her hand. Edward 

looks at the boys.


WALKER

You two boys stay close to Ivy here. 

She'll tell you some funny stories 

and have you laughing soon.


Ivy gathers the boys close as Edward stands. He turns to the 

worried crowd around him.


WALKER

We will go together. All of us.


CUT TO:


EXT. WALKING PATH  NIGHT


A SNAKE OF HANDHELD LIGHTS MOVE SLOWLY towards the village.


The members of the village move in a group led by elders. 

Lucius walks towards the front holding one of the lanterns.


Kitty and Christop move in the middle and walk in tense 

silence.


The procession moves towards the DIM LIGHTS OF THE CABINS.


CUT TO:


EXT. COURTYARD  NIGHT


The elders have already moved into the courtyard. They walk 

in stunned silence.


Lucius and the young men are next to follow.


When Kitty arrives her hands move to her mouth. Christop 

stops in front of her.


THE COURTYARD BEFORE THEM IS LITTERED WITH DEAD ANIMALS. 

CHICKENS, AND SQUIRRELS AND RACCOONS. THEY HAVE ALL BEEN 

SLAUGHTERED AND SKINNED, THERE ARE A HANDFUL OF SKINNED 

ANIMALS DANGLING FROM ROPES TIED TO THE POSTS OF THE HOUSES.


The villagers move like ghosts through their courtyard. Edward 

Walker moves amongst them. He walks up to one of the hung 

animals and with shaking hands, slowly unties the knot and 

lowers the animal to the ground.


A young man walks up to Edward Walker, hesitates and then 

taps him on the shoulder. GERALD speaks in a whisper when 

Edward turns.


GERALD

They would like you at the shed, 

sir.


Everyone is moving towards doorways. Christop is trying to 

pull a stunned Kitty through the chaos.


Elders usher people towards the nearest porch.


Lucius picks up two children in his arms and moves them to a 

doorway.


Ivy follows a group of people into a cabin.


Kitty stands in HER BEAUTIFUL WHITE WEDDING FROCK. Christop 

tugs at her arm. She finally is pulled across the littered 

courtyard and disappears into the darkness of a cabin.


CUT TO:


EXT. SHED  NIGHT


Alice Hunt stands alone by the open entrance to the shed.


Edward Walker approaches her. She steps away so he may look 

inside. Edward steps into the doorway of the shed. He stares 

quietly into the shadows of the food shed. Empty cages hang 

open throughout the structure.


Alice speaks softly from outside.


ALICE

All the livestock has been taken, 

and skinned. The fur and feathers 

are missing.

(beat)

There are marks on the door, where 

it was opened.


Edward's eyes move to the doorjamb. He sees the fresh torn 

wood at eye level.


ALICE

The marks are high. Coyotes cannot 

reach that height.


Beat. Edward stares into the darkness of the shed.


WALKER

(soft)

Are you scared Alice?


ALICE

(whispered)

I am, sir.


WALKER

(soft)

So am I.


CUT TO:


EXT. CANOPY  NIGHT


There is no one in the wedding canopy. THE CANDLES HAVE ALL 

BUT FLICKERED OUT.


A handful of chairs lay on their sides.


CUT TO:


EXT. TOWER  NIGHT


Two young men stand in the tower. One man eats leftover cake 

from a wooden plate. He cuts a piece off and hands it to his 

partner.


They eat wedding cake as they stare into the darkened woods.


CUT TO:


INT. IVY'S BEDROOM  NIGHT


Ivy lies in bed. She is awake. THE MOONLIGHT STREAMS IN 

THROUGH THE HALF CLOSED WOODEN SHUTTERS.


THERE IS THE SMALLEST OF NOISES OUTSIDE.


Ivy gets out of bed. She moves to the window slowly.


Her outstretched fingers reach the shutter first. She pushes 

the shutter open.


She stares out into the darkness.


CUT TO:


EXT. WALKER PORCH  NIGHT


Ivy walks out with a shawl over her night dress. She moves 

to Lucius who sits on the stairs of the porch.


He turns as she sits down next to him. Beat.


IVY

The elders are going to have an 

inquiry tomorrow. Each member of the 

village is to be questioned in the 

meeting hall.


LUCIUS

To see how the border was breached?


IVY

Yes.


Lucius nods silently. Beat.


LUCIUS

It is cold outside. You ought to go 

in.


IVY

Why are you on this porch?


LUCIUS

It is not safe.


IVY

There are other porches.


Beat. There is an awkward moment. Ivy searches for something 

to say.


IVY

Do you find me too much of a tomboy?


Lucius shakes his head lightly, "No."


IVY

I do long to do boy things.

(whispers)

Like that game the boys play at the 

stump. They put their backs to the 

woods and see how long they can wait 

before getting scared. It's so 

exciting.

(softer)

I understand you hold the record. It 

will never be broken they say.


LUCIUS

It's just children's games.


IVY

How is it you are brave when all the 

rest of us shake in our boots?


LUCIUS

I do not worry about what will happen. 

Only what needs to be done.


Beat.


LUCIUS

How did you know I was here.


IVY

I saw you out the window.

(beat)

No, I won't tell you your color. 

Stop asking.


Beat. The wind blows stronger. They see leaves move all around 

them.


IVY

When we are married, will you dance 

with me?


Lucius looks at her.


IVY

I find dancing very agreeable.


Beat.


IVY

Why can you not a say what is in 

your head?


LUCIUS

Why can you not stop saying what is 

in yours?


Ivy is surprised by the strength in Lucius' voice.


LUCIUS

Why must you lead, when I want to 

lead? If I want to dance, I will ask 

you to dance. If I want to speak, I 

will open my mouth and speak. Everyone 

is forever plaguing me to speak 

further. Why? What good is it to 

tell you, you are in my every thought 

from the time I wake? What good can 

come from my saying I sometimes cannot 

think clearly or do my work properly? 

What gain can rise from my telling 

you the only time I feel fear as 

others do is when I think of you in 

harm? That is why I am on this porch 

Ivy Walker. I fear for your safety 

before all others.

(beat)

And yes I will dance with you on our 

wedding night.


Ivy sits in the moonlight. Tears stream down her cheeks. A 

hand reaches out and wipes a tear. This causes more tears to 

fall.


Lucius Hunt leans forward and kisses Ivy Walker on the porch 

of her father's home.


CUT TO:


INT. WALKER BEDROOM  MORNING


Ivy and Kitty sit on their old bed together. Ivy squeezes 

her sister's hand.


IVY

Kitty, I wanted to speak with you 

first. I would not want you to feel 

pain in any fashion. You are my 

cherished one. If you were to feel 

badly about Lucius, I would not have 

it. One love to sacrifice another 

love is not right.


The two sisters sit quietly. Kitty moves the stray hairs 

from Ivy's face.


KITTY

(soft)

Do not fret, younger sister.


Ivy closes her eyes.


KITTY

There is nothing you can do that 

would sacrifice my love for you. You 

are my cherished one as well.

(Kisses Ivy on the 

head)

God bless you and your life together.


The two sisters sit holding hands in the room they used to 

share.


CUT TO:


INT. MEETING HALL  MORNING


A woman in her twenties stands before a committee of five 

elders.


WOMAN

...I had been to the storage shed 

twice to fetch food prior to the 

wedding ceremony.


ALICE

And the livestock was untouched at 

that time?


WOMAN

Yes, Mrs. Hunt. All was as it should 

be.


Beat. Alice nods.


WOMAN

Could this be a new creature?


ALICE

What do you mean?


WOMAN

If there are Those We Don't Speak Of 

in the woods, could there not be yet 

another creature, similar, but 

different to our own creatures.


August Nicholson and the rest of the elders stare quietly at 

the woman. Beat.


ALICE

I suppose it is possible.

(beat)

Thank you Beatrice.


BEATRICE nods and starts out.


BEATRICE

I beg your pardon...


The elders look up to find Beatrice still in the meeting 

hall.


BEATRICE

Is it true, about Lucius and Ivy?


Alice is taken a little off guard.


BEATRICE

There are whispers all over the 

village.


She glances to Edward and Tabitha who smile back. Alice turns 

to the woman.


ALICE

We were informed early this morning 

of their intentions.


BEATRICE

It is amazing to witness which two 

people love chooses to unite. It 

follows no rules.


ALICE

(soft)

No, it doesn't.


Alice gently looks down.


BEATRICE

God bless them both.


ALICE

Thank you dear.

(smiling)

Please ask the next person to enter.

A line of villagers wait patiently outside the doors of the 

meeting hall cabin.


Beatrice walks out and lets the next person in.

INT. HUNT CABIN  MORNING


Lucius Hunt opens the front door to his cabin.


LUCIUS

What's happened?


Noah Percy stands in the doorway sobbing. Beat.


Noah walks in. Lucius closes the door.


LUCIUS

Is this about Ivy and myself?


Noah doesn't answer. Beat.


Lucius heads back to his desk. Lucius folds the piece of 

paper he was writing and places it in the drawer.


LUCIUS

I know you are very fond of her.


Noah shakes his head. He move to Lucius.


LUCIUS

I know she is fond of you.

(turns)

There are different types of love 

Noah --


Lucius barely sees THE SHARP BLADE.


NOAH AND LUCIUS STAND EYE TO EYE. BEAT. NOAH PULLS OUT THE 

BLADE FROM LUCIUS' STOMACH.


WE WATCH LUCIUS FOLD TO THE FLOOR OF HIS CABIN.


NOAH, STILL CRYING, CHANGES THE GRIP ON HIS KNIFE AND BENDS 

DOWN OVER LUCIUS.


CUT TO:


INT. PERCY BEDROOM  MORNING


Vivian Percy is helping Robert with his vest. She gently 

straightens out his collar. They've done this routine many 

times.


THERE IS A NOISE FROM THE CABIN'S ENTRANCE.

Noah, you'll be late for the meeting 

hall. Would you like your father to 

walk you there?


Robert Percy places his eyeglasses on.


VIVIAN

Noah?


CUT TO:


INT. PERCY CABIN  MORNING


WE ARE MOVING THROUGH THE PERCY CABIN. THE MAIN SITTING ROOM 

IS EMPTY. WE SEE THE FRONT DOOR IS OPEN. WE MOVE TOWARDS IT.


THERE IS A NOISE, A CREAKING THAT GROWS IN STRENGTH. WE MOVE 

TO THE FRONT DOOR AND THEN THROUGH IT.


WE ARE ON THE PORCH. THE CREAKING SOUND IS VERY LOUD. WE 

TURN AND SEE NOAH SEATED IN A ROCKING CHAIR. HE ROCKS BACK 

AND FORTH CREAKING ON THE NOISY WOOD OF THE PORCH.


HE TURNS AND LOOKS OVER WHEN HE FEELS HIS PARENTS PRESENCE.


VIVIAN AND ROBERT PERCY STAND FROZEN LIKE A BAD PAINTING.


NOAH POINTS AT HIS WET SHIRT.


NOAH

The bad color.


CUT TO:


INT. MEETING HALL  MORNING


The elders look away from the man who stands before them, 

They turn to the SOUNDS OF COMMOTION COMING FROM OUTSIDE THE 

MEETING HALL CABIN.


The door opens, a short flustered man enters. THE NOISE AND 

GROWING COMMOTION SPILLS INTO THE MEETING HALL.


A couple of the elders stand.


FLUSTERED MAN

I beg your pardon --


EDWARD

What is it?


Beat.


FLUSTERED MAN

There has been an accident.


CUT TO:


EXT. WALKING PATH  MORNING


Ivy and Kitty step off their porch together. They make their 

way down the walking path. There is a GROWING SOUND OF VOICES 

ahead of them.


Two people come rushing past.


KITTY

Helen what is it?


One of the girls stops and comes back. She speaks in a frantic 

whisper.


GIRL

Noah Percy was found with quarts of 

blood upon his clothes and hands... 

The blood was not his own and he 

will not speak as to whose it is.


KITTY

Dear God in heaven.


HELEN runs off.


Ivy's face changes. Beat.


Ivy lets go of her sister's hand. She starts moving away.


KITTY

Ivy, where are you going?


Ivy does not respond. Her walk becomes quicker and quicker. 

Kitty stares after her as her sister breaks into a run.


CUT TO:


EXT. COURTYARD - MORNING


WE HEAR IVY COUNTING UNDER HER BREATH AS SHE RUNS.


IVY

Eighteen -- nineteen -- twenty --


On the twentieth step she reaches the end of the path and 

makes the turn around a cabin into the courtyard.


THERE IS A COMMOTION ALL AROUND HER. SHE HEARS KNOCKS AND 

DOORS OPENING AND CLOSING. ELDERS YELL OUT.


AUGUST (O.S.)

Are there any injured in here?


ALICE (O.S.)

Has anyone been hurt in this home?


Ivy runs past all the voices. She runs past all the frantic 

people and movement.


THE SOUNDS OF COMMOTION ARE BEHIND HER.


She crosses the entire courtyard, brushing people as she 

runs.


She reaches the quiet part of the village; the part not 

searched yet.


Her feet hit the walking path stones similar to the ones 

near her house.


She drops her walking stick and keeps going.


She reaches a turn in the path and goes in the wrong direction 

before realizing and changing directions. She starts running 

again. Her hair comes flying out from its bindings.


IVY

(exhales)

-- Twenty-two -- twenty-three.


She comes to a quick stop and puts her hands out. She feels 

the wood of the front door of the Hunt cabin.


She pushes it open.


CUT TO:


INT. HUNT CABIN - MORNING


She steps into the silent cabin.


IVY

Lucius?


Ivy uses her hands to find the first piece of furniture. 

It's a chair. She walks around it.


IVY

Lucius Hunt you answer me this moment!


Ivy moves slowly across the room, heading towards Lucius' 

loft.


Her foot HITS SOMETHING. SHE STOPS.


She is now standing in the middle of the cabin. Ivy bends 

down and gropes with her hand. Her hand comes back dripping.


Ivy kneels to the ground and searches with her hands for 

Lucius' head. She finds his shoulders and pulls with all her 

strength to get him onto her lap.


THERE ARE VOICES AND NOISE OUTSIDE. FOOTSTEPS ARE HEARD.


A young man steps into the doorway. He is instantly stopped 

by what he sees. He quickly runs away.


WE HEAR MANY FOOTSTEPS NOW.


Edward Walker is the first one in the doorway. He begins 

shaking his head violently. Tears instantly fall over his 

anguished face.


WE HEAR MORE FOOTSTEPS APPROACH.


The area behind Walker gets filled with villagers.


Edward Walker gathers himself for a moment. He speaks to 

those closest behind him.


WALKER

Do not let Alice Walker come here.


A handful of those in shock behind him, leave.


Ivy Walker sits on the floor of the cabin with a bloodied 

lump of clothes and flesh in her arms. She looks in the 

direction of her father's voice.


IVY

(desperate)

I cannot see his color.


CUT TO:


EXT. SICK CABIN  DAY


The entire congregation of the village waits outside the 

sick cabin. Everyone is silent. All watch the windows of the 

narrow cabin.


A FLAG OF WHITE FLIES at half mast next to the cabin.


Ivy walker listens TO THE SNAP OF THE WHITE FLAG.


A door to the cabin opens. Mrs. Clack walks out and approaches 

the group. She glances at Ivy and then looks to the group.


MRS. CLACK

It is best to be direct at moments 

such as these. He has suffered a 

great deal. He is very weak. He may 

pass at any time.


Some women in the group begin to cry. Parents hold their 

children a little tighter.


MRS. CLACK

Please give him all your prayers and 

good thoughts. He will hear them.


Ivy concentrates on the SOUND OF THE FLAG. She listens to 

the RHYTHMIC SNAPS. Then slowly, her face begins to tremble. 

She finally begins to cry.


CUT TO:


INT. THE QUIET ROOM  DAY


The heavy wooden door to the quiet room is being unlocked. 

Robert Percy turns from the door. His face ashen. He steps 

aside.


Ivy moves to the door. She opens it.


Next to the sacks of potatoes, in the corner of shades, Noah 

Percy sits in the only chair in the room. He sits eerily 

straight up. When he sees who it is, he smiles. The CHAIR 

CREAKS AS HE STANDS.


Ivy walks straight to THE SOUND. She reaches for his face. 

Finds it... and CRACKS HIS FACE WITH A VIOLENT SLAP. Noah 

covers his face with his hands. She slaps him again and again. 

Her hands hitting his ears, his hands. She stands there 

hitting him. He stands there taking it.


Robert Percy takes hold of her and gently pulls her off him. 

After a moment, she stops raising her hand. She lets herself 

be quietly taken form the room.


The door is closed again. Locked again.


FROM INSIDE THERE IS A SUDDEN BURST OF SCREAMS. IT DIES DOWN 

TO A WHIMPER.


CUT TO:


INT. SICK CABIN  DAY


One of the oldest of the elders, VICTOR, stands near the 

door to the sick cabin with Tabitha and Edward Walker.


In the background we can see Alice Hunt sitting next to the 

only occupied cot. There are low sounds coming from the lump 

that is Lucius.


The three elders in the doorway, speak in whispers.


TABITHA

(whispers)

I am very worried for Alice. She 

will not speak.


EDWARD

(whispers)

Her son is to die. There is nothing 

to say.


Beat. Edward turns to Victor.


EDWARD

(whisper)

There is nothing to say. Victor am I 

correct in that statement?


Victor shakes his head.


VICTOR

(whisper)

There were six wounds inflicted. 

Five of the wounds are not life 

threatening. The sixth was made to 

the chest. When I listen to his 

breastplate, I cannot hear airflow 

as I should. The sound is deadened. 

He is having greater and greater 

difficulty breathing.


EDWARD

(whisper)

What can be done to mend him?


VICTOR

(whisper)

We can only pray.


Beat.


EDWARD

(whisper)

If there were no limitations, what 

could be done?


Tabitha's eyes move to her husband's. Victor looks directly 

at Edward who stares back quietly. Beat.


VICTOR

(whisper)

What are you asking me?


EDWARD

(whisper)

Is there anything at all that can be 

done to mend the boy?


Beat. Edward's eyes are tearing up.


EDWARD

(whisper)

Please Victor, would you be so kind 

as to answer my question...


Tabitha and Victor stare in stunned silence. Beat.


VICTOR

There is one other option.


CUT TO:


EXT. WALKER PORCH  DAY


Ivy Walker sits still in a rocker on the porch of her cabin. 

She does not look over as her father comes onto the porch 

and stands by her. Beat.


IVY

Has he passed?


WALKER

No.

(beat)

You know the moment I heard my child's 

vision had finally failed her, and 

that she would forever be blind, I 

was sitting in that very chair.

(beat)

I was so ashamed.


IVY

(soft)

Why?


WALKER

(soft)

For not protecting you.

(beat)

Could we take a walk Ivy?


CUT TO:


EXT. WALKING PATH  DAY


Edward and his daughter move along a walking path. Edward 

leads her off the path onto the grass. They continue walking.


WALKER

What do you know about your 

grandfather?


IVY

He was the wealthiest man in the 

towns.


WALKER

That he was. He had a gift for that. 

If he was given one dollar, in less 

than a fortnight he would have turned 

it into five. You do not know of 

money. It is not a part of our life 

here. Money can be a wicked thing. 

It can turn men's hearts black... 

Good men's hearts. My father could 

not see this. For all his gifts, he 

was a poor judge of a man's character. 

Your grandfather was a good man Ivy. 

He had a laugh that could be heard 

three houses away. He used to hold 

my hand as I hold yours.

(beat)

He taught me strength and showed me 

love and told me to lead when others 

would only follow.

(beat)

Your grandfather James Walker, died 

in his sleep. A man put a gun to his 

head and shot him while he dreamed. 

I tell you this, so you will 

understand some of the reasons for 

my actions and the actions of others.

(beat)

You are a strong one Ivy. You lead 

when others would follow. You see 

light when there is only darkness. I 

trust you among all others.


They stop walking.


IVY

Thank you father.


WALKER

Ivy do you know where you are?


IVY

At the old shed that is not to be 

used.


They stand next to a worn shed hidden in tall grass.


Edward opens the lock on the small shed.


WALKER

Ivy...


IVY

Yes, father.


WALKER

Do your best not to scream.


IVY

What?


CUT TO:


INT. SHED  DAY


WE ARE IN THE DARKNESS OF A SHED. LIGHT POURS IN AS EDWARD 

OPENS THE DOOR. He steps in.


He puts out his hand and helps Ivy inside.


IVY

There is an odd smell.


WALKER

It is ahead of you.


IVY

What is it?


WALKER

I cannot explain in words.

(beat)

It is just a few steps.


Beat. Ivy steps forward. Her hands go out - searching. Her 

fingers reach into the shadows of the shed.


She touches something. Her hand glides over the GLISTENING 

FUR. Her fingers graze the TEETH. IT MOVES.


Ivy pulls back and stifles a scream with her own hands.


Edward catches her.


IVY

-- Those We Don't Speak Of.


Edward holds her gently.


WALKER

Do not be frightened. It is only 

farce.


WE SEE IN THE DARKNESS NOW. HANGING FROM WOODEN RAFTERS ARE 

NINE OR TEN SUITS OF FUR AND CLAWS. EACH ONE HAS A HUMP -- 

EACH HAS DARK AND LIFELESS EYES.


THE COSTUMES CREAK AS THEY SWING SLIGHTLY ON THEIR HOOKS.


CUT TO:


EXT. BEHIND OLD SHED  DAY


Ivy is seated in the grass with her back to the shed. Edward 

stands near her.


WALKER

There did exist rumors of creatures 

in these woods. It is in one of the 

history books I used to teach in the 

towns.


Ivy nods as if she understands.


IVY

The ceremony of meat.


WALKER

We remove it ourselves. An elder is 

always assigned.


IVY

The drills? They are farce too?


WALKER

We did not want anyone to go to the 

towns Ivy.


IVY

What about the animals? The skinned 

ones? Are the elders responsible for 

that too?


WALKER

It was not us. We do not know what 

did that.


Beat.


Ivy's face begins to tremble. Edward kneels down.


Edward Walker reaches out and takes Ivy's hand in his. He 

places a TINY FOLDED PAPER in her hand and closes her fingers 

over it.


WALKER

(whispers)

On this paper has been written a 

tool of medicine. It is common in 

the towns.


Ivy looks up. Edward holds his hands tight over his daughter's 

closed fingers.


WALKER

(whispers)

Lucius Hunt will pass if he does not 

receive this soon. He may pass 

regardless.

(beat)

You are to go with two others and 

follow the path near the stream. A 

half day's journey will bring you to 

a hidden road. There, the two others 

will wait as you continue. You alone 

will follow the hidden road to the 

end of Covington Woods.

(beat)

You are to tell no one in the towns 

where we are and return with haste.

(beat)

You gave your heart to this boy. His 

mother is in need. Are you ready to 

take on this burden, which, by right, 

is yours and yours alone?


Father and daughter are crying. They are leaning towards 

each other now. Their foreheads almost touching.


IVY

(whispers)

I do.


CUT TO:


INT. WALKER CABIN  DAY


Edward Walker sits at the small table next to the stove. He 

waits outside the open door to Ivy's bedroom.


Through the doorway we see her packing a cloth bag. Her yellow 

cloak lies on the bed.


CUT TO:


EXT. COURTYARD  DAY


Ivy moves through the courtyard. Her walking stick moves 

steadily back and forth. Her cloth bag is stuffed and hangs 

against her back.


CUT TO:


EXT. RESTING ROCK  DAY


Ivy sits in her yellow cloak. Her hood is up over her head. 

She sits on the enormous rock embedded in the base of the 

hill.


Her hand moves under her hood. She looks like she's wiping 

tears, but we cannot see her face.


Ivy just sits there... gathering strength.


THERE IS A NOISE. She looks up. Two cloaked figures emerge 

from the path. They stand in silence across from her.


CUT TO:


INT. SICK CABIN  DAY


Alice sits in a chair to the side of Lucius' bed. Lucius 

lies under the sheets asleep. His hair is damp. His face is 

white. His breathing is shallow and labored.


THE SOUND OF THE DOOR TO THE CABIN OPENING AND CLOSING CAN 

BE HEARD.


Edward walks into the cabin. He moves towards Alice and 

Lucius. They are the only three in the cabin. Beat.


EDWARD

(soft)

Alice, I have sent for help.


Alice looks up. Beat.


EDWARD

(soft)

I have sent Ivy to the towns.


Now Alice stands.


ALICE

(soft)

-- You  cannot


Alice starts crying. Edward wants to touch her. He leans 

towards her.


EDWARD

(soft)

It is all that I can give you.

(trembling)

...It is all that I can give you.


Alice looks at the man standing so close to her. She looks 

in his childlike eyes.


ALICE

(soft)

I accept.


They stand together, almost touching. They both are trembling. 

Beat.


Edward gently nods and steps away. Alice slowly takes a seat 

next to her son. She holds her son's hand tight.


CUT TO:


EXT. BORDER NEAR CREEK  DAY


Three cloaked figures move towards the line of trees at the 

start of the woods. The two large figures flank the smaller 

one. They all carry cloth bags on their back.


There is a creek to their right. It travels from the woods 

into their valley.


The three stop at the border.


We see their faces under their hoods. Ivy Walker is in the 

center. To her one side, is Christop Crane. To her other 

side is Finton Coin.


Ivy's fingers run over the yellow slash of paint on the tree 

bark. She listens and hears the SNAPPING OF THE YELLOW FLAG 

ABOVE HER. YELLOW FLAGS SNAP IN THE DISTANCE ON THE EITHER 

SIDE OF HER.


Finton glances to the soil and sees the claw marks in the 

dirt just in front of them. He looks over to Christop who 

has seen them too. Finton looks like he may faint on the 

spot.


Ivy is the first to move. She holds out her stick and takes 

a step. Her foot presses into the dirt amongst the large 

clawed footprints. The others follow.


Ivy steps into the woods. She makes it to her sixth step 

before Finton's trembling hand touches her shoulder. She 

turns to him.


FINTON

Christop.


Ivy turns and faces back the way she came. Christop stands 

on the other side of the border. He has not stepped into the 

woods with them.


IVY

Christop make haste.


Christop stands crying at the forbidden line.


CHRISTOP

(crying)

I beg your pardon.


IVY

You needn't be scared. You were told.


CHRISTOP

(crying)

I will be unable to join you.


IVY

They had costumes Christop.


FINTON

Please Christop, do not leave us.


IVY

There is nothing to fear.


CHRISTOP

-- Then why do you wear the cloak of 

the safe color?


Finton looks at Ivy wearing her yellow cloak. Her hood is 

up. He realizes the truth in what Christop is saying.


IVY

We will light torches. It will be 

safe.


Ivy stares in the direction of Christop's voice. Her eyes 

are steeled.


IVY

Do not worry what will happen. Only 

what needs to be done.


Christop wavers for a second. Beat. He is still crying as he 

backs away.


CHRISTOP

(crying)

It is forbidden.


Finton watches as Christop backs away. He turns and moves 

down the slope out of sight. Beat.


IVY

Come if you are coming.


Finton turns and finds Ivy walking into the woods. Her walking 

stick taps trees as she moves.


Finton stands where he is. He lets her get ten feet away 

before running and catching up to her.


CUT TO:


EXT. TREE TOPS  DAY


We look down from the branches of the trees. Below us is a 

bed of leaves and dirt. The leaves come to life and begin 

swirling in agitation. The wind moves through the trees like 

a presence.


Down below, two specters in yellow move through the woods. 

Their hoods pulled tight over their scared faces.


CUT TO:


EXT. BACK OF SICK CABIN  DAY


The elders have gathered behind the sick cabin.


They wait and watch as August Nicholson comes around the 

corner. He hurries over.


AUGUST

(whispers)

I had a difficult time getting away.

(beat)

What is it?


Everyone turns to Edward. He gathers himself before he speaks.


EDWARD

(whispers)

I have sent Ivy to the towns to 

retrieve medical supplies.


The elders are stunned. Mr. and Mrs. Percy stand like ghosts.


MRS. CLACK

What have you done?


EDWARD

Lucius has a chance --


MRS. CLACK

We have agreed, never to go back - 

never.


EDWARD

What was the purpose of our leaving? 

Let us not forget, it was out of 

hope of something good and right.


MR. PERCY

You should not have made decisions 

without us. You have gone too far.


EDWARD

I am guilty Robert. I made a decision 

of the heart. I cannot look into 

Alice's eyes and see the same look I 

see in August's. It is too painful.


August stares at Edward.


EDWARD

I cannot bare it.


MRS. CLACK

You have jeopardized everything we 

have made.


EDWARD

Yes I have. I hope I am always able 

to risk everything for the right and 

just cause. If we did not make this 

decision - we could never again 

call ourselves innocent. And that in 

the end is what we have protected 

here - innocence.

(beat)

That, I am not ready to give up.


Beat.


AUGUST

There is still hope.


Edward looks to August and smiles.


EDWARD

Yes there is my dear friend.


MRS. CLACK

How could you have sent her? She is 

blind.


Edward stares at Mrs. Clack.


EDWARD

I sent her because I trust her. And 

it is in her blindness that our town's 

hope lives.


Beat. They all stand in silence.


CUT TO:


EXT. WOODS  AFTERNOON


Two torches have been lit and fit atop two thick branches 

stuck into the ground.


We hear the SIZZLE OF TINY RAIN DROPS AS THEY HIT THE FOREST 

FLOOR. Ivy and Finton tie a heavy cloth trap by its corners 

to nearby trees. They are racing the growing drizzle around 

them.


CUT TO:


EXT. TENT  LATE AFTERNOON


Finton and Ivy are seated with knees to their chests under 

the cloth tarp.


THE OVERWHELMING SOUND OF A DOWN POUR ECHOES THROUGHOUT THE 

FOREST.


Finton stares through the gray wall of pounding rain all 

around him. Everything is a blur.


In the haziness of the world of trees around him, THERE IS A 

THING OF DARKNESS. Finton leans forward a bit as he stare 

more intently.


Rain continues to cloud and obscure his view. THE THING OF 

DARKNESS FAR AWAY SEEMS TO FLICKER AND MOVE.


Finton's mouth opens a bit as he stares. THE THING OF DARKNESS 

SEEMS TO GET SMALLER AND THEN GETS WASHED AWAY BY THE RAIN.


Finton waits and watches. There is nothing to be seen but 

the constant downfall of rain. Beat. Finton turns to Ivy. 

She remains huddled and quiet. Finton turns back to the rain 

and looks around nervously.


CUT TO:


EXT. TENT SITE  DUSK


The rain has stopped.


Finton stands with his bag over his shoulder. He peels away 

layers of soggy cloth from the torches.


FINTON

They are useless.


Finton turns and walks slowly over to Ivy who stands by the 

tent. Beat.


FINTON

Ivy.


IVY

You may go.


FINTON

Darkness will be here soon.


IVY

It is always here for me.


FINTON

It is not too late to return.

(beat)

There must be another way to help 

Lucius.


Beat. Ivy continues to stand with her back to Finton.


FINTON

Do not pretend you do not feel it. 

There is something in these woods. 

It turns my stomach to rot. The elders 

themselves admit there were stories 

of creatures in these woods long 

before they arrived.


Ivy does not turn to face him. Beat.


FINTON

(emotional)

You will be safe. They will not harm 

you because you cannot see. They 

will take pity on you as they took 

pity on Noah when he ventured into 

the woods.

(beat)

They will kill me Ivy. I cannot stay.


We see Ivy's face. She is frightened.


IVY

It is my burden, Finton. You may go.


When she hears THE SOUND OF FINTON'S FOOTSTEPS RUNNING AWAY, 

all she can do is close her eyes.


CUT TO:


EXT. TENT  NIGHT


The forest has turned to shadows and black. There is a small 

figure huddled under the cloth tarp. She is huddled under 

her yellow cloak. Her hood is pulled low over her face. She 

lets only her tired eyes peek through.


THE SOUND OF THOUSANDS UPON THOUSANDS OF CICADAS FILL THE 

AIR WITH THEIR HIGH PITCHED VIBRATO. THE SOUND SEEMS TO GET 

LOUDER AND LOUDER. UNNATURALLY LOUD.


Ivy has to cover her ears. Her head bows and we lose sight 

of her eyes.


CUT TO:


EXT. WOODS  MORNING


A slender hand is held out in the air. It slowly pivots till 

A PATCH OF SUN WASHES OVER ITS PALM. Ivy uses the heat from 

the sun to guide her direction.


Ivy's silhouette moves against the harsh slant of the morning 

sun.


Her cane moves back and forth in front of her.


Tap. She adjusts and moves around a tree. Her feet are 

stepping in mud. She keeps moving.


Tap. She adjusts and continues forward. He left foot lands 

in deeper mud. She pulls it out and keeps going.


Tap. She changes position and takes a step. THERE IS NO GROUND 

WHERE SHE STEPS. HER HANDS GO OUT AS SHE FALLS. SHE GRABS 

THE EARTH AS IT SLAMS INTO HER ARMS.


SHE IS HANGING ON AN EDGE. SHE TRIES TO PULL HERSELF UP. THE 

GROUND IS ALL MUD - SHE BEGINS TO SLIDE. SHE FLAILS AS SHE 

DISAPPEARS INTO THE HOLE IN THE FOREST.


WE WATCH FROM ABOVE as she comes to a stop ten feet down the 

hole's wall.


CUT TO:


EXT. HOLD  MORNING


Ivy is in a hole about fifteen feet deep. At the bottom there 

are the SOUNDS OF WATER RUNNING OVER ROCKS.


Her walking stick has wedged into the roots of some trees 

that are sticking out in this hole in the ground.


Some loose rocks and dirt come free as Ivy finds her footing 

in the mud wall.


The debris falls to the rock floor.


Ivy catches her breath before pulling herself up.


CUT TO:


EXT. WOODS NEAR HOLE  MORNING


We see her stick climb over the edge of the hole. Her hand 

is the next in view as it takes hold of some roots to drag 

herself out.


She finds the base of a tree and moves to standing.


Her fingers travel over an unusual CROOKED BRANCH of the 

tree. She ducks under it and steps away from the hole.


She takes a couple heavy breaths... and begins to laugh. It 

is a tired laugh as she whips her hands at her sides to get 

the thick mud off her fingers.


She puts her hand to her cloak. It comes away full of mud... 

She slowly stops smiling. Her other hand goes to the surface 

of her cloak. It comes away with slick mud.


WE SEE IVY NOW, FULL FIGURE. HER CLOAK AND HOOD IS COATED IN 

MUD. HARDLY ANY OF THE SAFE COLOR YELLOW CAN BE SEEN.


Ivy starts wiping the mud from her cloak. Her movements are 

even at first and then become more desperate as her hands 

just slide over the slick mud.


We watch her in SILHOUETTE frantically trying to wipe off 

the mud.


CUT TO:


EXT. WOODS  DAY


The mud caked figure of Ivy moves through the forest. Her 

walking cane swings back and forth.


Tap. Crack.


Ivy stops walking. She runs her hand over the cane and finds 

it fractured three-quarters of the way down.


Her fingers tremble over the crack. She takes hold of each 

end and checks its strength. THE CANE SNAPS. THE SOUND ECHOES 

THROUGH THE AIR.


A moment later, WE HEAR ANOTHER SNAP SOMEWHERE FAR AWAY.


Ivy turns. Beat. She remains still under her hood. We watch 

as she slowly lowers to the ground. Her hand reaches out to 

the ground. Her fingers search the leaves. After a moment, 

her hand finds a rock.


She hesitates, and then throws the rock as far as she can. 

It lands with a CRUNCH IN A BED OF LEAVES.


Ivy stays crouched and listens. THE WIND RUSTLES. Beat.


AND THEN WE HEAR IT -- THE IDENTICAL SOUND OF A ROCK LANDING 

IN A BED OF LEAVES SOMEWHERE BEHIND HER.


Ivy rises in terror. Her hood slips off her head as she starts 

to move. Her hands go out in front of her as she begins to 

run.


Branches slap at her arms and face. Her hand slams into a 

tree, she SCREAMS IN PAIN. She tries not to stop, she moves 

around it and keeps running.


Another tree catches her shoulder. She spins and almost falls 

to the ground. She clutches her shoulder as she gathers her 

balance. She keeps running.


She holds her hand up as she runs through a collection of 

small branches. They shatter against her forearm. She does 

not stop.


Ivy's hands start waving in front of her like her walking 

stick. She is running as fast as she can.


SHE PASSES INCHES FROM A LARGE TREE THAT WOULD HAVE CRUSHED 

HER. She keeps running.


The branches stop striking her arms. She is racing through a 

slight clearing. She is out of breath. She slows and stumbles 

to an exhausted stop.


She breathes slowly and looks around, listening in all 

directions. WE PULL BACK AND SEE SHE IS STANDING ALONG A 

HILLSIDE COVERED IN RED FLOWERS. THE BAD COLOR BLANKETS THE 

GROUND ALL AROUND HER.


Beat. AS HER BREATHING BECOMES SOFTER AND MORE NORMAL ANOTHER 

SOUND CAN BE HEARD.


IT IS ALSO BREATHING, BUT IT IS MORE ANIMAL IN NATURE - 

STRONG SNORTING SOUNDS - HORSE LIKE.


Ivy turns slowly in a circle till she finds the direction of 

the SLOW ANIMAL SNORTING.


Beat. STANDING FORTY FEET AWAY FROM HER IS THE LARGE DARK 

UPRIGHT FIGURE OF A HUMPED CREATURE. IT STANDS WITH ITS BACK 

TO IVY.


THIS CREATURE IS LARGER AND HAIRIER THEN THE COSTUMES THE 

ELDERS HAD.


THE CREATURE ROCKS A BIT SIDE TO SIDE LIKE ITS AGITATED.


Ivy moves ultra-slow. She begins backing up. She makes it a 

few feet before bumping up against the thick trunk of a tree.


THE CREATURE REMAINS WHERE IT IS, WITH ITS BACK TO US, ROCKING 

BACK AND FORTH.


Ivy edges around the trunk of the tree. She moves around it 

till she is hidden. WE LOSE SIGHT OF THE CREATURE FORTY FEET 

AWAY.


Ivy has her back to the bark. Her chest rises and falls with 

her panicked breaths. She listens. WE CANNOT HEAR THE ANIMAL 

BREATHING.


Beat. Ivy leans back around the tree slowly. WE SEE FORTY 

FEET AWAY, THE CREATURE IS NO LONGER THERE.


WE SUDDENLY HEAR A VERY LOUD ANIMAL SNORT.


Ivy jerks back.


Ivy's face tilts down. WE SEE AT THE BASE OF THE TREE, AN 

ENORMOUS MOUND OF FUR. THE MOUND SHAKES AS IT BREATHES OUT 

LOUDLY. THE CREATURE LIES ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE TREE.


Ivy begins the longest walk of her life. Her striking face 

remains quiet with exhaustion and fear as she keeps moving. 

The tree in the background behind her gets smaller and 

smaller.


She gets a hundred feet away before we HEAR THE ANIMAL GROWL 

LOW AND MENACING. Ivy stops. She has to turn and face the 

sound.


THE CREATURE IS NOW STANDING NEXT TO THE TREE. WE BARELY SEE 

ITS DULL LIFELESS EYES UNDER ITS FUR.


There the two face each other across a hundred feet of woods. 

There is a terrible stillness; the kind of stillness people 

often feel before something awful is about to happen.


Suddenly the creature starts moving in long and fast strides 

towards Ivy.


Ivy reacts too slow to the ON COMING SOUND. She turns and 

begins running...


THE ANGRY ANIMAL SOUNDS GAIN ON HER... SHE SCREAMS...


THE FIRST BLOW IS FAST AND SUDDEN. ALL WE SEE IS FUR AND 

CLAWS. IVY IS KNOCKED TO THE GROUND VIOLENTLY.


THE CREATURE CONTINUES PAST HER MOVING INTO THE WOODS. WE 

SEE IT START TO TURN BACK ABOUT FIFTY FEET AWAY - LIKE A 

BULL IN A BULL FIGHT.


Ivy get ups. She has a set of fresh cuts along the side of 

her neck.


Ivy turns and runs into the thickest part of the forest.


CUT TO:


EXT. DENSE WOODS  DAY


Her hands go out again as branches and trees close in around 

her. She fights her way through.


HER OWN BREATHING, AND THE BREAKING OF BRANCHES AND THE CRUSH 

OF LEAVES FILL HER EARS AS SHE RUNS.


A tangle of branches from a clump of trees slows her. She 

slaps and strikes at the branches. They snap and break off.


She runs untill she can run no more. She slows out of pure 

exhastion. She comes to a stop. Her hands hold onto a thick 

branch in front of her as she rests.


THERE ARE NOISES BEHIND HER.


She is too tired to move. Her hands tremble on the branch.


THE NOISES GET LOUDER.


Her fingers slide over the CROOKED BRANCH. Her fingers stop 

with recognition. They go back over the crooked bend in the 

branch.


WE HEAR LOUD MOVEMENT -- GALLOPING IN THE DRY LEAVES. BRANCHES 

SNAP QUICKLY BEHIND HER.


Ivy steps around the branch. Beat. Ivy closes her eyes...


THE CREATURE STRIDES TOWARDS HER...


Ivy raises her arms at her sides. Her body makes the form of 

the crucifix. She stands steady as THE SOUNDS OF THE CREATURE 

RUSH TOWARDS HER...


She holds.


THE CREATURE IS SUDDENLY UPON HER...


At the last possible second, she moves. It is fast and 

unexpected. HER FEET SLIDE ON THE MUDDY EDGE AS SHE DIVES 

QUICKLY TO THE SIDE...


THE CREATURE'S CLAWS JUST GRAZE HER MUDDIED ROBE AS IT DROPS 

INTO THE HOLE IN THE WOODS.


CUT TO:


INT. QUIET ROOM  DAY


The door to quiet room is unlocked. Robert and Vivian Percy 

open the door. They hold food in a wooden plate in their 

hands.


VIVIAN PERCY

Noah?


They step into the musty room. Their eyes go to the center 

of the room's floor. A handful of floorboards have been pulled 

up.


In the hole beneath the floor boards THERE ARE CHICKEN 

FEATHERS AND BITS OF ANIMAL FUR. A PATCH WHERE TWO FUR PIECES 

HAVE BEEN KNITTED TOGETHER LIES ON THE WOODEN FLOOR BY THE 

OVERTURNED FLOOR BOARDS.


Vivian Percy drops the plate of food.


In the back of the quiet room, the potato sacks have been 

pushed aside. Where they sat against the wall is an opening 

three feet in width and height. HARSH SUNLIGHT POURS IN 

THROUGH THE OPENING.


CUT TO:


EXT. HOLE IN WOODS  DAY


The creature lies utterly still.


WE SEE THE CREATURE'S FUR IS RAGGED AND MADE UP OF DOZEN AND 

DOZENS OF ANIMAL FURS PATCHED TOGETHER.


THE CHICKEN FEATHERS THAT HAVE FILLED IT'S HUMP HAVE SPILLED 

OUT OVER THE VIOLENTLY SHAPED ROCKS THAT THE CREATURE IS 

LAYING ON.


ITS HEAD LAY HALF ON AND HALF OFF.


Noah Percy is bloodied and crying. A surge of pain makes his 

face a tight knot of strain. He gasps as his boyish eyes 

dart around in panic. He wants to scream. He can't.


A wave of pain crushes his face again and then slowly relaxes. 

He makes small whimpering sound. Tears fall down his cheeks. 

He does not make another sound. His eyes stare forever frozen 

in a moment of a young boy's shock.


WE SEE THE SILHOUETTED FIGURE OF IVY STANDING ON THE EDGE OF 

HOLE LOOKING DOWN. SHE IS LIKE A GOTHIC HOODED FIGURE against 

the bright sky.


CUT TO:


EXT. EDGE OF HOLE  DAY


Ivy listens for noises below. None comes. She backs away 

form the edge. She turns and shakily moves through the tangle 

of branches.


Her hands find the crooked branch. She feels its strength 

and then takes hold of it. She pulls and tugs at it until 

she feels it crack. She pulls down with all her weight and 

the thick branch snaps off.


CUT TO:


EXT. WOODS  DAY


Ivy's new walking stick moves back and forth in front of 

her. TAP. It hits a tree, she moves around it.


The wind starts to blow hard. Leaves start to swirl around 

her.


THEN SHE HEARS THE FIRST WAIL FROM THE WOODS.


Her stick stops moving.


THE WAIL IS LIKE A SCREAM AND IT IS NOT HUMAN. THE FIRST 

WAIL IS JOINED BY ANOTHER AND THEN ANOTHER.


THE SCREAMS AND WAILS COME FROM ALL DIRECTIONS. THE SOUND IS 

OVERWHELMING.


Ivy drops her stick and covers her ears.


WE SEE WHAT SHE CANNOT... THE TREES IN THESE WOODS HAVE HOLES 

THROUGH THE CENTERS OF THEM. WE WATCH AS WIND TRAVELS THROUGH 

THESE HOLES AND CAUSES A SOUND... A SCREAM.


IVY

(yelling)

It is for love that I am here! I beg 

you to let me pass!


Beat. THE SCREAMS CONTINUE FORM THE WOODS AS THE LEAVES KEEP 

SWIRLING.


Ivy's hands lower from her ears.


WE HEAR NON-HUMAN SCREAMS FROM FAR OFF IN THE WOODS.


Ivy reaches down and finds the branch she was using as a 

walking stick. She rises to her feet defiantly.


IVY

(crying)

It is for love --


THE SCREAMS AND WAILS SEEM TO MOVE AND SWARM AROUND HER.


She takes her first step. She is trembling but finds strength 

to take a second. Her stick starts moving back and forth as 

her steps turn into a walk and her walk turns into a run.


CUT TO:


INT. SICK CABIN  AFTERNOON


Lucius Hunt struggles hard to breathe. Alice Walker keeps a 

steady watch over her son.


Edward Walker steps next to her chair. He watches Lucius 

fighting to live.


EDWARD

(soft)

His will to live is very strong.


Alice turns in Edward's direction.


ALICE

(soft)

Love of your daughter makes him 

strong.


Edward nods. He moves towards the entrance to the sick cabin. 

His wife Tabitha waits for him there. He opens the door and 

he and Tabitha exit together.


CUT TO:


EXT. GRAVEL ROAD  AFTERNOON


Ivy's stick moves back and forth through high weeds. She 

holds her palm out and continues to check the location of 

the sun.


Suddenly, the weeds are gone. The stick moves back and forth 

unimpeded. THERE IS A CRUNCH UNDER HER FEET.


Ivy stops. She taps her stick to the ground and HEARS THE 

SMALL TICKS OF STONES.


Ivy instantly becomes agitated and excited. She starts moving 

forward, her STEPS CRUNCHING UNDERNEATH HER. She moves until 

she feels her stick hitting weeds again.


She knows the width of the GRAVEL ROAD she is on.


She turns around and counts her steps back to the centre. 

She holds her hand up and searches for a patch of sun. She 

finds it. She turns and faces her body east.


Ivy is breathing heavy form excitement. She starts forward. 

With each step there is a CRUNCH. THE CRUNCHES START TO GET 

CLOSER TOGETHER AS IVY STARTS PICKING UP HER PACE.


Ivy removes the cloth bag from her shoulder. She lets it 

drop to the gravel and dirt as she walks.


She starts walking faster.


Ivy starts tugging at her mud caked cloak. She juggles her 

walking stick as she pulls the dirty cloth over her head. 

She slips her arms out of the tangled cloth and drops the 

crumpled cloak to the gravel and dirt floor.


Ivy starts running.


CUT TO:


INT. WALKER CABIN  AFTERNOON


Edward Walker and Tabitha are standing in their cabin. They 

are holding hands. The cabin is silent. There is no one else 

there.


Edward gently lets go of his wife's hand and moves to the 

corner of the cabin. Tabitha's eyes follow her husband. She 

turns and walks to the front door and closes it.


We watch her put the wooden plank in place to lock it.


CUT TO:


EXT. WALL OF VINES  AFTERNOON


Ivy runs on the hidden dirt and gravel road. Her stick waves 

low and in front of her.


THERE IS A SUDDEN THUD AS THE STICK HITS A PACK OF FOLIAGE.


Ivy comes to a quick stop with her hands out. Both hands get 

swallowed into greenery.


Ivy feels around with her hands. There is A WALL OF VINES 

AND WEEDS IN FRONT OF HER.


Ivy moves to her side and finds the wall of foliage continues 

into the woods.


Ivy stops and puts down her walking stick. She reaches up 

and searches for something to hold. She wedges her foot into 

a clump of knotted weeds and pulls herself up onto the wall 

of green.


CUT TO:


INT. WALKER CABIN  AFTERNOON


Edward Walker turns the key of the BLACK BOX. He lifts the 

lid into its standing position.


Tabitha stands at his side.


Edward reaches into the darkness of the box. There is some 

folding clothing. His hands push aside the first layers and 

take hold of a heavy cloth. He pulls it out. We see its blue 

unfold as he raises it. Dusts dances off of it and swirls in 

the air.


Tabitha takes a slow breath. Edward Walker stares at it with 

his sad childlike eyes.


WE LEAVE EDWARD AND TABITHA WALKER IN THEIR CABIN STARING AT 

THE PAIR OF FADED BLUE JEANS EDWARD HOLDS IN HIS HANDS.


CUT TO:


EXT. HIGHWAY  AFTERNOON


WE ARE LOOKING THROUGH A TRUCK'S WINDSHIELD. WE SEE A 

DASHBOARD WITH A STYROFOAM CUP. WE SEE A HAND HOLDING A 

STEERING WHEEL.


WE ARE MOVING ALONG A HIGHWAY lined on one side by forest. A 

ten-foot mesh fence covered over with vines and weeds borders 

the forest.


In the distance there is a SPOT OF WHITE climbing down the 

weed-covered fence.


WE ARE MOVING FAST. THE SPOT GETS LARGER.


THE WHITE SPOT turns into a figure dressed in white, which 

lands in the weeds at the side of the highway.


WE ARE MOVING ALONG SIDE IT.


THE FIGURE IN WHITE IS A GIRL. SHE STEPS OUT IN FRONT OF THE 

TRUCK.


THE DELIVERY TRUCK SWERVES TO AVOID HER; IT SWERVES INTO THE 

ONCOMING LANE AND LOSES CONTROL.


THE TRUCK ARCS IN THE ROAD; THE SCREAM OF BRAKES SHATTERS 

THE AIR.


The truck comes to a stop in the middle of the highway.


We hear a SNAP as the truck door opens.


THE TRUCK DRIVER gets out.


He looks frustrated and walks to the girl who stands in the 

middle of the highway.


TRUCK DRIVER

I didn't see you --


The striking looking girl stands with her hands at her ears.


TRUCK DRIVER

Are you hurt?


The girl slowly lowers her hands. She stares in his direction.


GIRL

What was that noise?


TRUCK DRIVER

What are you doing out here?


Beat.


GIRL

Are you from the towns?


The young truck driver looks at the white girl's old-fashioned 

clothing for the first time.


TRUCK DRIVER

Where did you come from?


Beat.


GIRL

The woods. You ought not tell anyone.


TRUCK DRIVER

You need help or something?


GIRL

A doctor of medicine. I need to find 

these things. We must hurry.


The girl holds out her hand. There is a dirty paper folded 

in it. The driver steps forward and takes the paper. He 

unfolds it. Beat.


TRUCK DRIVER

I have two or three syringes in my 

first aid kit. You can have them if 

you want.


GIRL

You have the things written on the 

paper?


TRUCK DRIVER

I think so.

(beat)

Is someone sick?


The girl suddenly has tears in her eyes. Beat. She nods, 

"yes."


CUT TO:


EXT. GAS STATION  LATE AFTERNOON


The same large delivery truck sits at a small country gas 

station by the side of the highway.


The truck driver finishes filling the tank and walks to the 

tiny wood shingled building that serves as the gas station.


There is a bench outside the door to the shingled building. 

AN OLD WOMAN AND AN OLD MAN are seated there. They are 

weathered and fairly unpleasant to look at. They are wearing 

multiple coats each. Their bodies have kind of melted into 

the bench from years of sitting there.


The truck driver steps up.


OLD WOMAN

Twenty-five dollars please.


TRUCK DRIVER

Twenty-five?


OLD WOMAN

Pennsylvania Gas Tax.


TRUCK DRIVER

Oh.


He pulls the cash out of his wallet and hands it over.


TRUCK DRIVER

Pardon me, but what is that over 

there?


The truck driver points across the highway to the ten-foot 

fence covered in ivy and weeds that lines the road.


OLD WOMAN

Private property.


TRUCK DRIVER

Who lives there?


OLD WOMAN

No one. It's for animals. Seventy-

two thousand acres of woods. No one's 

loud to step foot in there. They got 

it fixed so planes ain't even allowed 

over it.


TRUCK DRIVER

But who lives there now?


OLD WOMAN

No one. Ain't you listening?

(beat)

Walker family owns it. But they ain't 

none of them left. The youngest son, 

a history professor disappeared some 

twenty-five years ago. They got some 

estate watching over it now.


Beat. The young driver stands thinking.


OLD MAN

Why are you all curious?


The three of them stare at each other. The truck driver look 

like he's going to say something. An eternal beat.


TRUCK DRIVER

Just curious.


The young truck driver nods and heads back to his delivery 

truck.


The old man turns to his wife.


OLD MAN

Pennsylvania Gas Tax? - Good one 

Paula.


The old woman laughs a phlegmy, hard laugh that shakes the 

bench.


The truck driver gets into the cab of his truck. He sees 

through his window the old couple laughing in the bench. He 

shakes his head.


TRUCK DRIVER

Crazy-fucking-white people.


HE TURNS THE IGNITION ON and pulls away form the country gas 

station.


WE SEE his truck on the highway as it rides along the ten-

foot fence that marks the preserve. The weed-covered wall 

goes on for as long as the eye can see. It stretches out 

till it disappears into the horizon, like some painting in a 

children's book.


FADE TO BLACK:


THE END
